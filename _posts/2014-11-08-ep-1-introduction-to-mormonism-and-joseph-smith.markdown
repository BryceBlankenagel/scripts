Hello,

Welcome to the Naked Mormonism podcast, my name is Bryce Blankenagel and
thank you for joining me. Here, we study the history of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (or LDS Church). Not the sugar coated
PR friendly history that the church itself teaches, but the real history
so we can know where it really came from, and compare it to the current
teachings of the church. I'm looking to build a body of knowledge,
hopefully with your help, about the LDS church in it's factual entirety
so listeners can understand what this thing really is. I also want to
call the church out on it's masonic ritualism, mystic origins, cultish
agenda, and high proplensity to mind-fuck it's followers, so if any of
that offended you, then you should either shut it off, or, open your
mind, give it a listen and try to reconcile why the facts offend you.

(INTRO MUSIC)

First off, I need to offer a little background on me as well as the
podcast. I was born and raised in Utah and was a member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the LDS church) until around the age
of 15. I was faithful to the LDS church, better known as a true
believing mormon, but I slowly became apathetic toward it, like most
teenage mormons do. I was also dissatisfied with various answers I would
get to seemingly important questions about the doctrine, but I just
figured every doubt could be explained away and I was going through a
doubting phase much like all my friends, family and church leaders told
me I was. However, the doubt and apathy conspired to eventually corrode
my will power for church attendance, so I just stopped going to church
around 17, much to all my friends and families' dismay. Even though my
attendance at church declined, I still attended Seminary class
throughout my freshman-senior years. Seminary is more or less mormon
speak for bible study during school hours that the church sponsors. They
fund a separate building off of school property, within walking distance
of the school, and the class is called "released time" for legal
purposes, of course. After high school, I ended up graduating seminary,
but, out of loathing for the church, I virtually severed every tie I had
in the community. I still spent time with my closest friends, but
everybody else became very distanced from me. Fast forward 5 years, and
I'm living in another state with a whole new outlook on life.

You as the listener may be asking, so what? The book had a preface and
now it doesn't, what's the big deal. It may seem a little bit vague for
now, but it is a large accumulation of a lot of small differences that
illustrate how terrible of a book writer God is. I don't by any means
intend on reading the original print of the Book of Mormon in an effort
to point out the differences for the simple fact that the BOM is already
being done by someone with more talent than I, and needless to say it
would be a bit redundant. But it does spur the conversation, what else
has the LDS church made slight alterations on throughout it's history?
And more importantly, what history does the church simply not talk
about, and can that history be used to demonstrably show the church had
false foundations? Unfortunately these aren't questions I can answer in
one or two episodes, but it's something that I can only try to
demonstrate for you, the listener, through a massive overload of
information all contained in one podcast. I'm going to try and offer the
history of the church from the watered down perspective that all Mormons
are taught and teach, and then tell the history from the perspective of
the people that were there and compare the facts. I don't expect the
lds.org website to say anything that is blatantly infactual, however I
do want to unpack and verify the facts behind what is said. We will be
hearing quotes from current and past apostles and prophets as well as a
lot of the big players in the foundation of the church leading up to
where it is now. This is a historical and sholarly approach to a body of
knowledge from an ex-mormon truck driver with nights and weekends off.
What can I say, I have an insatiable curiousity about the cult I was in
since birth. That's right I said cult, that word carries such a negative
context when the root of it is just a culture. I wasn't just raised as a
member of the Mormon church, I was raised in a completely Mormon
culture. I lived in a cult, so let's just drop the negative stigma from
that word right now because it's a very useful and fitting word without
the negative context. 

Anyway, let's get to examining the history of the early LDS Church. Our
focus for quite a few episodes will be on the founding prophet of the
Church Joseph Smith, as well as the people that surrounded Joseph that
were integral pieces to the church. There is a lot of history to cover
so we are going to take our sweet ass pimpin time to make sure we leave
no stone unturned. 

Today we start with the history of the Smith family. 

1\. Smith was born in Sharon, Vermont, the fifth of eleven children born
to Joseph Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith.

a. Sadly their first child died soon after child birth leaving Joseph
Sr. and Lucy devastated but determined to raise a family.

b. In 1803, 2 years before Joseph Jr. was born, Joseph Sr. lost all the
familys money in an overseas ginseng business scandal. The family never
fully recovered from that absolute destitution.

1a. Joseph was born Dec 23, 1805. raised in rags. 

2\. In the winter of 1812 many members of the family caught typhoid
fever including Joe Jr. 

side note "Joseph or Joe is referring to Joseph jr. now, Joseph sr. will
be reffered to as "big daddy cheese"

a. Joe jr. underwent an expiremental procedure to cure an infected leg
that involved scraping to remove the infected tissue as opposed to
amputation.

1\. This is a common story told about joseph smith in the church. Joe
had to get the procedure in order to save his life but the doctor
couldn't put him under for it. And joe being the brave little 8 Y.O.
refused drinking alchohol to numb the pain that was in store for him
because he knew that it was bad for him.

2\. I would speculate that Joe didn't understand the long term health
ramifications of drinking alcohol at that time, however.... I would
argue that he may have seen how big daddy cheese acted when he was
drunk. This happened fairly frequently during the years of financial
hardship the family had after the bad business deal in the Ginseng
market.

3\. By 1817, Smith's family had moved to the "burned-over district" of
western New York, 

4\. Religious revivals were extremely common all along the east coast
states during this time, but especially in this 'burned over". 

5\. Smith parents held divergent views about organized religion, 

a. Big daddy cheese. believed in visions and prophecies and engaged in
folk religious practices typical of the era. He disagreed wholly to
organized religion which was reinforced by a pastor telling him and Lucy
that their unbaptized son Alvin is burning in hell when he died in 1823.

b. The fallout from alvin dying may have had some influence on the
Family Centered doctrine of the church that was later made exponential
through polygamy in early day practices. 

1."Its amazing how fast an infant religion can grow when you have a
model built on uneducated country bumpkins fucking like rabbits and
having waaaaay to many uneducated kids that are dragged out into the
desert and have no choice but to be subserviet to the religion"

c. Lucy Mack Smith was a little more dogmatic taking the family from
church to church in search of "the one true church". 

6\. The revelation of the one true church being restored to the earth
through Joe Jr. came at a very crucial time to keep the family together.

a. like previously mentioned, not in a vacuum. Many people of notoriety
in the area, as well as many other lay people believed in a
restorationist movement coming from the burned over district.

b. PRIMITIVIST is another word for it. "Next time you see a mormon call
them a primitivist and see if it illicits any sort of intelligent
reaction"

c. ASAEL SMITH, big daddy cheese's dad, joe jr.s big bad gpa, was quoted
saying "It has been bestowed upon my soul that one of my descendants
will promulgate a work to revolutionize the world of religious faith".
Even his gpa was encouraging little deluded joe to be the next big
godsend as he started showing a propensity to the occult.

d. For any never mormon people listening, Joseph is seen as equal or
greater than Jesus. If this quote doesn't sum it up I don't know what
else does.

BRIGHAM YOUNG or as we will later come to know as 'Bloody Brigham'
Journal of discourses 7 289

"The lord had his eyes upon him joseph smith, and upon his father, and
upon his fathers father, and upon their progenitors clear back to
Abraham, and from Abraham to the flood, from the flood to Enoch, and
from Enoch to Adam. He watched that family and that blood as it has
circulated from its foundation to the birth of that man." hmmmmmm, no
mention of Jesus in there.....   

7\. Joe was steeped in many spiritual and magical practices, thanks to
the education of his father, of which one of his favorites was "scrying"
or looking through a rock to receive special knowledge or see something
that is not seeable with muggle eyes or something.

8\. Joe was brought into court in 1826 for being "a disorderly man and
an imposter" the court notes identify him as "The Glass Looker"

a. the details of his conviction are vague, Oliver Cowdery-influential
man and joes business partner/relative- states he was "honorably
acquitted (from the charges)"

9\. Joe and Joe Sr. had a bit of a reputation in the area before that
time for having a mysterious profession of treasure hunting although
there is no record of them finding anything, even though some residents
were willing to pay them for their services.

10\. First vision:

a. a lot of dispute of which occurence actually is the "first vision"
The church says it happened in 1820 

b. scholars say the first vision should be considered moroni in his
bedroom

c. the first account of the "wilderness" occurence was dictated by joe
in 1832, No other record exists

d. in 1832 dictation the date is stated 1821 not 1820 that the church
teaches today

1\. 1820 fits better with the narrative including the moroni appearance

e. why was first record of it 12 years after it supposedly happened

1\. original dictation just says "heavens opened and god said 'my son
thou sins are forgiven thee'"

2\. 1838 history of the church dictation has father and son appearing
with god saying "my-beloved-son-hear-him"

f. I tend to believe that the taught first vision is not accurate and
was fabricated later to help sell the book better as well as inspire a
divine origination that didn't exist as much before. ( I think the
evidence supports that opinion)

g. There are 22 visitations by moroni on record from 1823 to 1829,
possibly more

g1. Moroni visited Joe jr. The night of september 21-22 1823 Joe was 17.

g2. We will talk about the visitations by Moroni in a second

h. LUCY is quoted saying before joe even 'had the plates' 

"during our evening conversations, joseph would give us some of the most
amusing recitals that could be imagined. he would describe the ancient
inhabitants of this continent, their dress, their mode of travelling,
and the animals on which they rode, their cities their buildings, their
mode of warefare and also their religious worship. This he would do with
such ease that it would seem he had spent his whole life with them. 

11\. Acquistion of the plates. 

"In Smith's own account dated 1838, he stated that an angel visited him
on the night of September 21, 1823. Concerning the visit, Smith dictated
the following:

"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent
from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God
had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and
evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both
good and evil spoken of among all people.

He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an
account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from
whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting
Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient
inhabitants; also that there were two stones in silver bows—and these
stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim
and Thummim—deposited with the plates"."

12\. After the messenger departed, Smith said he had two more identical
encounters with the angel Moroni that night and an additional one the
next morning, after which he told his father and soon thereafter the
rest of his family, who believed his story, but generally kept it within
the family.

An 1841 engraving of "Mormon Hill" (looking south), where Smith said he
found the golden plates on the west side, near the peak.

Thus, on September 22, 1823, a day listed in local almanacs as the
autumn equinox, Smith said that he went to a prominent hill near his
home, and found the location of the artifacts.\[87\] There are varying
accounts as to how Smith reportedly found the precise location of the
golden plates. In 1838, Smith stated that this location was shown to him
in a vision while he conversed with Moroni.\[88\] This conforms to an
account by Smith's friend Joseph Knight, Sr., though he refers to
Smith's guide only as "the personage."\[89\] However, according to a
Palmyra resident Henry Harris, who said Smith told him he located the
plates using his seer stone.\[90\] In yet another account, the angel
required Smith to follow a sequence of landmarks until he arrived at the
correct location.\[91\]

The plates, according to Smith, were inside a covered stone box.
However, Smith stated he was unable to obtain the plates at his first
visit. According to an account by Willard Chase, the angel gave Smith a
strict set of "commandments" which he was to follow in order to obtain
the plates. Among these requirements, according to Chase, was that Smith
must approach the site "dressed in black clothes, and riding a black
horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and
after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down
nor look behind him".\[92\] Smith's close friend Joseph Knight, Sr.
corroborates the requirement that Smith was to "take the Book and go
right away".\[89\] According to Smith's mother, the angel forbade him to
put the plates on the ground until they were under lock and key.\[93\]
He was, however, according to a retelling of an account by Smith, Sr.,
allowed to put down the plates on a napkin he was to bring with him for
that purpose\[94\]

When Smith arrived at the place where the plates were supposed to be, he
reportedly took the plates from the stone box they were in and set them
down on the ground nearby, looking to see if there were other items in
the box that would "be of some pecuniary advantage to him".\[95\] When
he turned around, however, the plates were said to have disappeared into
the box, which was then closed.\[89\] When Smith attempted to get the
plates back out of the box, the angel hurled him back to the ground with
a violent force (id.).\[96\] After three failed attempts to retrieve the
plates, the angel told him that he could not have them then, because he
"had been tempted of the advisary \[sic\] and saught \[sic\] the Plates
to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should
have".\[48\]

Thus, Smith said the angel directed him to return the next year on
September 22, 1824, with the "right person", whom the angel reportedly
said was his brother Alvin.\[89\] However, Alvin died within a few
months, and when Smith returned to the hill in 1824, he did not return
with the plates. Once again, the angel reportedly told Smith that he
must return the next year with the "right person", the identity of whom
the angel would not say.\[89\] According to Smith's associate Willard
Chase, Smith originally thought this person was to be Samuel Tyler
Lawrence, a "seer" himself who worked in Smith's treasure-seeking
company in Palmyra,\[97\] and therefore Smith reportedly took Lawrence
to the hill in 1825.\[98\] At Lawrence's prompting, Smith reportedly
ascertained through his seer stone that there was an additional item
together with the plates in the box, which Smith later called the Urim
and Thummim.\[99\] However, Lawrence was apparently not the "right
person", because Smith did not obtain the plates in his 1825 visit.

Later, Smith reportedly determined by looking into his seer stone that
the "right person" was Emma Hale Smith, his future wife.\[89\] There is
no specific record of Smith seeing the angel in 1826, however, after
Joseph and Emma were married on January 18, 1827, Smith returned to
Manchester, and as he passed by Cumorah, he said he was chastised by the
angel for not being "engaged enough in the work of the Lord".\[100\] He
was reportedly told that the next annual meeting was his last chance to
get the plates and the Urim and Thummim.\[101\]

13\. There is one more thing to add in to the mix of the aquistion of
the plates. this is primarily cited from Mormonism Unveiled by E.D. Howe
but there is also the "Salamander Letter" which was spawned from some
referneces to a toad that prevented Joe from getting the plates from the
ground. The salamander letter is supposedly from Martin Harris to
william wines phelps put in show notes.

Palmyra October 23d 1830

Dear Sir

Your letter of yesterday is received & I hasten to answer as fully as I
can--Joseph Smith Jr first come to my notice in the year 1824 in the
summer of that year I contracted with his father to build a fence on my
property in the corse of that work I approach Joseph & ask how it is in
a half day you put up what requires your father & 2 brothers a full day
working together he says I have not been with out assistance but can not
say more only you better find out the next day I take the older Smith by
the arm & he says Joseph can see any thing he wishes by looking at a
stone Joseph often sees Spirits here with great kettles of coin money it
was Spirits who brought up rock because Joseph made no attempt on their
money I latter dream I converse with spirits which let me count their
money when I awake I have in my hand a dollar coin which I take for a
sign Joseph describes what I seen in every particular says he the
spirits are grieved so I through back the dollar in the fall of the year
1827 I hear Joseph found a gold bible I take Joseph aside & he says it
is true I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it
because of the enchantment the old spirit come to me 3 times in the same
dream & says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the
spirit transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the
hole & struck me 3 times & held the treasure & would not let me have it
because I lay it down to cover over the hole when the spirit says do not
lay it down Joseph says when can I have it the spirit says one year from
to day if you obay me look to the stone after a few days he looks the
spirit says bring your brother Alvin Joseph says he is dead shall I
bring what remains but the spirit is gone Joseph goes to get the gold
bible but the spirit says you did not bring your brother you can not
have it look to the stone Joseph looks but can not see who to bring the
spirit says I tricked you again look to the stone Joseph looks & sees
his wife on the 22d day of Sept 1827 they get the gold bible--I give
Joseph $50 to move him down to Pa Joseph says when you visit me I will
give you a sign he gives me some hiroglyphics I take then to Utica
Albany & New York in the last place Dr Mitchel gives me an introduction
to Professor Anthon says he they are short hand Egyption the same what
was used in ancient times bring me the old book & I will translate says
I it is made of precious gold & is sealed from view says he I can not
read a sealed book--Joseph found some giant silver specticles with the
plates he puts them in an old hat & in the darkness reads the words & in
this way it is all translated & written down--about the middle of June
1829 Joseph takes me together with Oliver Cowdery & David Whitmer to
have a view of the plates our names are appended to the book of Mormon
which I had printed with my own money--space and time both prevent me
from writing more at present if there is any thing further you wish to
inquire I shall attend to it

Yours Respectfully

Martin Harris

As hilarious as the implications this would bring about are, we can't
get too caught up in it. The letter is unfortunately a forgery by Mark
Hofman whom was born and raised in the mormon church. He was convicted
for having multiple forged historical items as well as murder. In an
interview he did attribute the inspiration of the letter to reading the
book by E.D. Howe. 

That isn't to say that there isn't multiple references to a toad
striking joe and rendering him incapable of retrieving the plates until
certain criteria were fulfilled. The first year he tried to get them the
toad supposedly told him to bring some remnants of his recently buried
brother. When that didn't work he had to take his wife, Emma, to help
him retrieve the plates.

14\. Sept 22. 1827 Joseph reportedly pulled the plates from the ground
with Emma sitting in the carriage praying for him while he went treasure
hunting.

That should be good enough to call a full session. I apologize if this
pilot has been a little dry, but there is a lot of crazy bullshit to cut
through and a podcast is a pretty blunt knife for this purpose. As we
get deeper into Mormon history, instead of just the main person
responsible for it, it ought to get quite a bit more entertaining from
here on out. D. Michael Quinn is an ex-mormon historian, and we will be
studying a lot from him in our quest for knowledge of the church. He
wrote this about Joe to summarize his character into one place,
hopefully, what we study will shed some light on this conclusion.

"Few Mormons today can grasp the polarizing charisma of their founding
prophet. Some may feel uncomfortable when confronted with the full scope
of Joseph Smith's activities as youthful mystic, treasure-seeker,
visionary, a loving husband who deceived his wife regarding about forty
of his polygamous marriages, a man for whom friendship and loyalty meant
everything but who provoked disaffection by 'testing' the loyalty of his
devoted associates, an anti-Mason who became a Master Mason, church
president who physically assaulted both Mormons and non-Mormons for
insulting him, a devoted father who loved to care for his own cchildren
and those of others, temperance leader and social drinker, bible
revisionist and esoteric philosopher, city planner, pacifist and
commander-in-cheif, student of Hebrew and Egyptology, band president,
jail escapee, healer, land speculator, mayor, judge and fugitive from
justice, gaurantor of religious freedom but limiter of freedom of speeh
and press, preacher and street wrestler, polygamist and advocate of
women's rights, husband of other men's wives, a declared bankrupt who
was the trustee-in-trust of church finances, political horse-trader,
U.S. Presidential candidate, abolitionist, theocratic king, inciter to
riot, and unwilling martyr.

That was from Mormonism 101: Examining the Religion of the Latter-day
Saints. 

That almost reads like a rap sheet for a 19<sup>th</sup> century Frank
Abagnale or something. In the coming weeks we will be digging way in to
Joseph Smith and see if the model we build doesn't match what D. Michael
Quinn said about Joe. Next week we will be talking about Emma Smith from
the beginning, as well as see her contributions to the early foundation
of the church. As for today, thank you once again for joining me on the
Naked Mormonism podcast. Talk at ya next week.
