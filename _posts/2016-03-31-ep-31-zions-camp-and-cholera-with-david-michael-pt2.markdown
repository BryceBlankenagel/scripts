Ep 31 - Zions Camp and Cholera with David Michael pt2

On this episode, we conclude the march of Zion's camp to Missouri. No
white Lamanite skeletons in this part of the trip, because Joe and
friends get down to business. From running battle scenarios under
General Lyman Wight, to dying like sheep with the rot, Zions camp deals
with the worst of times all for a test of faith. Listen in for the
unexciting, uneventful, anti-climax that brought the march of Zions camp
to a close.
