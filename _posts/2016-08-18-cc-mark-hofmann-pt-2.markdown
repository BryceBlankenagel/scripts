CC – Mark Hofmann pt. 2

On this episode, we dive right back into a “clean cut” examination of
the infamous Mark Hofmann. We cover from the end of 1983 up to the
bombings in October of 1985. Even with nearly 3 hours of audio, there’s
a lot being left out. Hopefully we’ll be able to wrap things up next
week, but no promises…

Hofmann audio tape Sunstone presentation  
<https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/mark-hofmann-25-years-later/>

Welcome to this CC episode of the Naked Mormonism Podcast, the Serial
Mormon History Podcast. Today is Thursday Aug 18, 2016, my name is Bryce
Blankenagel and thank you for joining me.

Today’s episode is part 2 of the Mark Hofmann story. If you missed part
1 and want to hear what happened previous to this episode, might I
suggest going back and listening to the first part. If you’re all caught
up or don’t mind picking up in the middle of the story, then this is the
episode for you.

In December of 1983, Mark Hofmann sold the Salamander letter to two men
named Steven Christensen, and Gary Sheets. Once it was publicized that
the letter existed and the church was attempting to buy it for the
purposes of suppressing its contents, the price was set at $40,000.
Christensen was the primary investor, while Gary Sheets was brought in
to finance a secondary document that was added to the Salamander letter
to sweeten the deal.

Christensen was the main guy who was dealing with the Salamander letter
who also ended up donating it to the church, so his name appears most
frequently when discussing the Salamander Letter, but keep in mind that
Gary Sheets was still involved with buying the Salamander letter from
Hofmann.

What I’m about to read is taken from Chasing the White Salamander, on
UTLM.org, check the show notes for a link to this chapter.

“After Mark Hofmann sold the letter to Steven Christensen, Christensen
"and Hofmann agreed to split the cost of $6,000 to have the letter
authenticated by Kenneth Rendell, a...rare book dealer recommended by
Hofmann." (*Utah Holiday*, Jan. 1986, p. 55) Mr. Rendell examined the
letter and sent it to other experts for their opinions. He was unable to
find any evidence of forgery. At the preliminary hearing he testified
that when he examined the letter he felt that it was authentic but that
he could not actually prove that this was the case: "First of all, I did
not determine authenticity. I mean, I dealt with the question of
authenticity, but I did not determine it to be genuine." Rendell said
that there was no material to compare the handwriting with although he
was given a few Martin Harris signatures: "...I did compare the
signature to four or five signatures, but frankly, I just couldn't rely
on the signatures." As I have already shown, after Kenneth Rendell saw
other forgeries Mark Hofmann had sold and found out that Lyn Jacobs had
admitted that he fabricated a story as to how the Salamander letter was
obtained, he began to have doubts with regard to its authenticity. At
the preliminary hearing he stated: "If someone came to me with this
letter in this context, I would not buy it. I could not offer it as
probably being genuine." He also said that he "would not sell this
letter."

    Mr. Rendell claimed that he was unable to find a relationship
between the Salamander letter and the other forgeries, but "If there is
one it's in the ink...and I...don't do ink analysis...that's out of my
area, and it now passes on to being a question of ink."

Kenneth Rendell was the man who was hired to examine the Salamander
letter to detect any outright signs of forgery, and there weren’t any.
Rendell took some Harris documents, including some signatures, and
compared them to the Salamander Letter, but there simply wasn’t enough
Harris material to compare it against. Also, it should be noted that
some of the Harris signatures he was using to compare against the
signature on the Salamander Letter, were possibly manufactured by
Hofmann already. Rendell may have been using Hofmann forgeries to
substantiate a Hofmann forgery. This could be one main reason why it
didn’t stand out as a forgery until many hours of research and
comparison had gone to determining it as such.

But, there were some signs that Hofmann couldn’t hide. The Salamander
Letter was a legitimate piece of paper that was held by Christensen, the
church, and anybody who would examine it, meaning it would undergo some
very serious scrutiny, and Hofmann must have known this to make such a
high quality forgery. With the letter actually being a real letter
though, Hofmann had to manufacture it somehow. There were cut marks on
the side of the paper that looked like they were made with scissors, cut
from a larger piece of old paper, this would not be expected with
typical paper in the 1830’s. Also, when examined under a microscope, the
ink that Hofmann used had some unusual cracking that wasn’t seen on any
other legitimate historical documents from the same time. This cracking
was probably a by-product of whatever process Hofmann used to make the
paper look aged or pressed as if it had actually existed for 150 years.

The whole time that many people were reeling from the discovery and
publication of the Salamander letter, Hofmann was cooking up other
forgeries and deals to keep him secure in his admittedly lavish
lifestyle. Jerald Tanner of UTLM began popularizing the idea that the
Salamander letter was a forgery and a document forger was out there
somewhere in April of 1984, while the following August Sunstone
Symposium is where discussion really began opening up about the
legitimacy of the letter. Let’s pick up Hofmann’s timeline from when the
Tanners introduced into the public sphere that the Salamander Letter may
be a forgery.

| October 1984      | In an address at General Conference, Elder Bruce R. McConkie warns members who conduct or support historical research threatening to the faith of other members. Three days later Christensen fires Brent Metcalfe from his research team, but gives him severance pay. Metcalfe had filled in for Christensen in giving a talk to the faculty at the LDS Institute of Religion at the University of Utah. The discussion had become very heated over Metcalfe's refusal to bear his testimony to the group after discussing the Harris 1830 letter. Christensen writes a letter to Pres. Hinckley shortly thereafter (16 October), in which he says he has decided to suspend research on the letter and to drop plans to publish a book about it. |  |  |

We’re going to listen to that audio of Bruce McConkie’s talk in General
Conference. This is titled the Caravan Moves On and it is the property
of the church, used for critique and educational purposes only, falling
under the fair use clause of creative commons. I extracted the audio
from the church’s official General Conference YouTube channel. There is
a link for it in the show notes and I encourage everybody to watch the
entire 18-minute video.

In this video you will hear how the church was trying to paint people
that were constructing the narrative of Joseph Smith being a treasure
hunter. They were afraid that something like this was an existential
threat to the church, so McConkie gets up on the stand and tells us what
true Latter-day Saints are supposed to do.

McConkie said it pretty straight-forward there. “No latter-day saint
that is true and faithful in all things will publish any article, book,
or material that weakens or destroys faith.” There is simply no way of
getting around the logical block that was put in place by this talk. If
anybody that was studying the Salamander Letter published a book or any
material that wasn’t faith promoting, or didn’t spin the news of the
letter in a way that is faith promoting, they could easily fall into
that category of those that are aiding a cause other than the Lord’s.
This is simply a chastisement of anybody seeking further knowledge into
historical studies, only thinly veiling how much the leadership was at a
loss for proper solutions to the Salamander Letter gaining traction in
the public sphere.

Near the end of 1984, Dean Jessee, the Mormon historian released a
pamphlet discussing the 1825 letter from Joseph Smith to Josiah Stowell
and the Salamander Letter. 3 pages were dedicated to the 1825 letter,
but the remaining 20 pages are dedicated to examining the Salamander
Letter. This gives us an idea of how much scrutiny and examination the
letter was barraged with, but passed every single test.

There will be a link to the entire pamphlet hosted on BYU’s online
library in the show notes.

I should note that on the last few pages of the pamphlet a large number
of photocopies of documents are contained, including 12 Martin Harris
signatures. One of the documents and 5 of those signatures were
forgeries by Hofmann that Dean Jessee was using to compare and validate
the Salamander Letter.

The best part about all of this is what Hofmann was doing while scholars
and historians were arguing about the legitimacy of his work. It seems
almost as if the church’s troubled PR campaign to deal with the
information in the Salamander Letter had no effect on him. He was still
manufacturing letters, bank notes, and nearly anything else possible
that would fetch a significant price. Hofmann was riding the bubble in
this market he was creating, and the bubble was still inflating.

Nearing the end of 1984, Hofmann seemed to decrease his dealings in
Mormon history and increase his forgeries in other historical realms. By
no means did he completely stop with Mormon forgeries, they were his
specialty so he couldn’t just abandon that world, but he began to really
increase the number of other historical documents he was producing.

| 15 February 1985 | Steve Christensen receives a report from Albert H. Lyter, III, a forensic chemist in Raleigh, North Carolina. Lyter had examined the ink on the Harris 1830 letter and reported: â€œThere is no evidence that the examined document was prepared at a time other than during the stated time period.â€ |  |  |
| 26 February 1985 | Christensen again writes to President Hinckley about the Harris letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |
| 29 February 1985 | President Hinckley calls Steve Christensen and assures him that the Church wants the Harris letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |  |

Even through most of 1985, the church was working on reconciling the
Salamander Letter with their own narrative, fully believing the letter
was real. Hofmann’s work kept passing test after test not showing any
apparent signs of being a forgery. Christensen and Hinckley continued to
exchange letters and discussions about the church accepting the letter
as a donation.

From everything I’ve seen here, and given the amount of time, it seems
like Hinckley was somewhat apprehensive to accept the letter as church
property. Think about it, if the church owned up to having the letter in
their possession, it could be perceived as a concession to the
legitimacy of the letter. People would expect the church to publish
books about the letter that reconciled the historical narrative with
this new idea of a White Salamander. As long as Steven Christensen had
the letter in his actual possession the church had some plausible
deniability. It was well known that Christensen, a bishop of the church,
owned the letter, but until the church accepted the donation of the
letter, they weren’t expected to publish work about their own history
surrounding the letter. It bought them time, but their actions show that
they were merely controlling the damage, they didn’t know how to deal
with the public outcry rising from this revelation. The church
leadership was stuck thanks to a situation Hofmann had orchestrated with
publicizing the Salamander Letter.

Hofmann, however, continued working. He set his sights on the ultimate
prize. If you remember back to the Sandra Tanner interview from part
one, you’ll remember that we briefly discussed the Oath of a Freeman. I
was only slightly familiar with it during the discussion and the history
surrounding the Oath doesn’t pertain to our discussion today, so I’ll
just read the 4 sentence Wikipedia page about it which gives us a
relative sense for how rare the Oath is.

“The Oath of a Freeman was a [loyalty
oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_oath) drawn up in the early
17th century, to be taken
by [freemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_\(Colonial\)) of
the [Plymouth Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Colony),
in the [Commonwealth of
Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts);
a freeman was any established member of a colony who was not under legal
restraint. The Oath was a vow to defend the Commonwealth, and not to
conspire to overthrow the government. It was first written in 1631, and
revised in 1634. Original copies survive only in a handwritten copy from
1634 and in a later printed version from 1647. [Stephen
Daye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Daye) made
a [broadside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadside_\(printing\)) printing
of the document in 1639, but it is now lost.”

For more reading check the show notes where you’ll find a link to
teachingamericanhistory.org talking about the Oath with the full text
intact. Needless to say, the Oath of a Freeman is one of the most
elusive and revered documents in American history. An original copy of
the Oath would be truly invaluable because there is no market to compare
them to. One of these originals has never been bought or sold before,
this would be Hofmann’s magnum opus if he could pull it off. This is his
timeline into spring of 1985.

| 8 March 1985  | â€œMike Hansenâ€ orders plate from DeBouzek Engraving in Salt Lake City for â€œThe Oath of a Freeman.â€                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |

| 11 March 1985 | Hofmann flies to New York City.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |  |
| 13 March 1985 | Hofmann purchases five items from Argosy Book Store in New York City for $51.42. One item he claimed he purchased at this time was the â€œOath of a Freeman,â€ the oldest printed item in American history. Hofmann claimed he paid twenty five dollars for this specific item. Several days later he returns with the â€œOath of a Freemanâ€ to Schiller's Gallery in New York City. Various authorities are contacted by Schiller to examine the broadside. William Matheson, Chief of the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress accepts the item and says a battery of tests would be performed on it to determine its authenticity. In April the Library of Congress tells Schiller and Wapner, Hofmann's agents, that it wants to buy the â€œOath of a Freemanâ€. |  |  |

Hofmann was able to get the Library of Congress to look into the Oath of
a Freeman and consider it legitimate. They didn’t know if it was real,
but the only reason they had to suspect it was a forgery was the rarity
of the document. Hofmann was established as a very legitimate historical
document trader, and this seemed like it was merely his next big find.
The Oath underwent said battery of tests for the next few months,
failing to show any signs of forgery whatsoever.

| 15 March 1985 | Thomas Wilding and Associate Syd Jensen, at Hofmann's invitation, agree to invest $22,500 in eighteen rare books.                                                                                                                         |  |  |

| 21 March 1985 | Wilding and Co. investors give Hofmann $22,500 to purchase rare books.                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |

| 3 April 1985  | Christensen tells Salt Lake Tribune that tests show Harris letter to be authentic, that researchers are preparing it for publication, and that their findings will be announced at the Mormon History Association Annual meetings in May. |  |  |
| 8 April 1985  | Schiller sends â€œOath of a Freemanâ€ to Library of Congress. Asking price: $1.5 million.                                                                                                                                                |  |  |
| 16 April 1985 | Letter of David & Peter Whitmer to Bithel Todd (dated 12 August 1828) sold to LDS Church for $1,500 by Hofmann.                                                                                                                           |  |  |
| 18 April 1985 | First Presidency accepts Steven Christensen's donation of the Harris 1830 letter to Church.                                                                                                                                               |  |  |

At this point, it almost became official that Hofmann could get away
with nearly anything. The church had finally accepted the letter as a
donation from Steven Christensen and Gary Sheets, symbolically accepting
it as a legitimate historical document. Regardless of what happened
after this, I think Hofmann just won in his own way. He got the church
to accept something he manufactured in his basement as a historical
fact. If we try and apply motives to Hofmann’s actions, it seems like
this is exactly what he wanted all along. He had been doing it for
around 6 years before this, but the church accepting something as absurd
and damaging to their own history as the White Salamander Letter was a
milestone. He had won in his mind, but the rest of the world didn’t know
about this. Unfortunately, people rarely quit while they’re winning.

| 23 April 1985 | Alvin Rust gives Hofmann money ($150,000) to purchase â€œMcLellin Collectionâ€ in New York City. Hofmann later tells Rust that he has sold the McLellin Collection to the LDS Church for $300,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |

Salt Lake Tribune claims 1825 Smith-Stowell letter exists, but Church spokesman denies that Church possesses it.                                                                                                                                                                              |  |  |

| 2 May 1985    | At Mormon History Association annual meetings in Independence, Missouri, Dean Jessee summarizes findings by experts who noted that nothing had been found indicating forgery. As Jessee would reemphasize in the months to follow one can prove forgery but not authenticity, and that authenticating is a matter of reducing probability, not of proving. Ronald Walker discusses context of treasure hunting into which the letter apparently fits. |  |  |

Things get a little confusing here as more people get involved and
Hofmann continues to set up deals. The McLellin collection unfortunately
marks the fall of Hofmann and mid-April 1985 is when this harbinger
rises to signal the collapse of Hofmann’s business model. Hofmann
claimed he had the McLellin collection, a box of journals and letters
that prove Joseph Smith to be a fraud, the likes of which the Salamander
Letter never thought possible. William McLellin was a prominent member
of the church during the early years from 1831 until the 1838 defection
crisis. He was also a school teacher and historian considered to be one
of the best contemporary historians to Joseph Smith we have available to
us.

Hofmann claimed the McLellin collection to be embarrassing to the church
and Joseph Smith, thus generating a lot of public excitement about it.
Hofmann had sold the Salamander letter as damaging to Mormon history,
and he delivered on that promise, so anybody hearing of the McLellin
collection from him knew when Hofmann said he had something good, he
wouldn’t disappoint. In April Hofmann borrowed money from Alvin Rust to
get ahold of the McLellin collection, only to tell him that he sold it
to the LDS church for double the money Rust had invested. I’m assuming
that meant that Rust would get repaid as soon as the church went through
on the deal. At this point, I think Rust was the only person that knew
about the collection from the mouth of Hofmann. A man named Hugh Pinnock
would later be the second person that Hofmann made a promise of the
McLellin collection to. It really seems to show signs of desperation on
Hofmann’s part when he takes money from two people claiming he can come
up with McLellin collection and sell it to the church with huge returns
on their investments, with no real plan to actually produce the
collection.

All the while Hofmann was working out the logistics of the McLellin
collection, people were still questioning his Salamander Letter. Even
Dean Jesse was saying that all of their studies can’t prove
authenticity, just rule out the possibility of forgery, something that
doesn’t translate to newspaper headlines very well.

To make the church look even worse during this time, Hofmann had sold
Christensen and Sheets the 1825 Smith-Stowell letter and anonymously
leaked to the Salt Lake Tribune that the church has the letter and is
hiding it.

| 5 May 1985  | Church spokesman retracts his denial of Church having the 1825 letter, saying, he was informed by President Hinckley that the letter was in First Presidency vault and perhaps would be subject of critical study as Harris letter had been.                                                         |  |  |

| 9 May 1985  | First Presidency releases text of 1825 Smith-Stowell letter with statement that Dean Jessee says document â€œappears definitely to be in hand of Joseph Smithâ€ and is earliest document written by the Prophet. Document expert Charles Hamilton of New York had authenticated the letter earlier. |  |  |
| 11 May 1985 | Newspapers nationwide feature headlines claiming that the Smith-Stowell 1825 letter links Mormon church founder to the occult.                                                                                                                                                                       |  |  |

Like I said last episode, Hofmann knew what screws to turn and just how
to turn them, that’s what we’re really seeing happen here.

| 14 May 1985 | Spokesman denies Church has hidden Oliver Cowdery history.                                     |  |  |

| 15 May 1985 | Walter McCrowe Associates find the Harris letter's paper â€œconsistentâ€ with period of date. |  |  |
| 20 May 1985 | Time magazine publishes â€œChallenging Mormonism's Rootsâ€ about the documents controversy.   |  |  |

This is an extract from the Time article, I can’t read the whole thing
because I don’t subscribe to the magazine and it’s behind a pay wall,
but if you want to read all of it, follow the link in the show notes.

“'It's an incredible crisis of faith for me," says Mormon Klaus Hansen,
who teaches at Queen's University in Ontario. "It means our historical
foundation becomes a nice story that has no connection to reality." To
Denise Olsen, a law student and mother of three in Bountiful, Utah,
"it's another evidence to me that things have gone awry in the church."
A devout Mormon couple in Whittier, Calif., in a letter to friends
explaining why they have left the church, say new revelations about the
Mormons' founding prophet have destroyed their belief.”

I can only assume that the rest of the article is just as unflattering
and indicative of how well the church was handling these Hofmann
documents surfacing. Hofmann’s documents were really gaining national
attention. Prominent news outlets were covering the church’s response to
these documents and joining in the public voice that was pressuring
church leadership to publish these challenging Mormon documents. This
must have been exactly what Hofmann had wanted all along, although
there’s no way of really knowing that for sure.

We need to burn through this to get to the really good parts so I’m just
going to hit on some of the highlights of the next few months leading up
to October of 1985.

| 20 May 1985       | Kenneth Rendell verifies, based on his examination and tests, and based on ink and paper tests done by others, â€œthat there is no indication that this \[Harris\] letter is a forgery.â€                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |  |

| Early June 1985   | Brent Metcalfe, who earlier had passed to John Dart, a reporter with the Los Angeles Times, information from an anonymous source \[Hofmann\] about the existence of an Oliver Cowdery history hidden by the First Presidency, now meets with Hofmann and Dart in Salt Lake City. Hofmann tells Dart he has seen the Oliver Cowdery History in the vault of the First Presidency, that this history contains a different account of the origins of the Church, and that it credited Alvin Smith with a key role in obtaining the Book of Mormon Plates. |  |  |

There’s just too much going on with Mark Hoffman to keep track of
everything. It’s all just a blur in my mind at this point in the
research. Hofmann was setting up deal after deal to keep his head above
water. He was deep in debt and it seemed like he was just pulling off
whatever deal he could manage for any amount of money he could possibly
get.

Maybe saying that he was doing it just to keep his head above water is
the wrong perspective. Last episode I said he was approaching some of
his business with a crackhead mentality. He had sold the Salamander
Letter to Steven Christensen for $40k, but to sweeten the deal he tacked
on the 1825 Smith-Stowell letter which added another $15k to the deal
and a bit more money down, that’s when Gary Sheets entered the equation.
Remember, Hofmann set up this convoluted deal and promised to deliver on
a forgery he had yet to manufacture because he had a “cash flow
problem”. It seems like he was willing to make promises and do
whatever necessary to keep the money flowing in, even if that meant
putting himself in an uncomfortable situation, but maybe viewing it as
desperation is the completely wrong way to view what Hofmann did.

Do you have a friend, cousin, relative, or somebody in your life that’s
an adrenaline junkie? They might grow up building ramps to jump their
bike or skateboard off, or possibly walk balance beam style across the
tops of the monkey bars high above the playground. Adrenaline junkies
are never satisfied with doing something and calling it good, they
always have to raise the stakes. That kid jumping her bike off plywood
ramps at the age of 6 is jumping motorcycles and doing tricks in the air
by her mid-twenties. That same kid walking the tops of the monkey bars
is found cooking an omelet on a high wire attached to two skyscrapers
spanning Time’s square in his 30’s. Adrenaline junkies always need to up
the ante, that’s just their life’s purpose.

That being said, I don’t think it’s a stretch of imagination to say that
making deals and conning people into buying forgeries were Hofmann’s
thing. He was great at it, arguably the greatest at it\! I would argue
that he wasn’t making these deals to only sustain his lifestyle, but
more to sustain his life’s purpose. What that purpose may have been, I
don’t think we can ever really know. But if we apply this adrenaline
junkie mindset to Hofmann’s business deals, it would make sense that he
kept doing more epic deals with greater stakes whenever he found the
opportunity. He was known for asking people if there was a document they
were looking for. Once they told him, he would say something along the
lines of, I’ll look into it and see if I can’t find what you’re looking
for. Remarkably enough, he would often show up a few weeks later with
exactly what the person was looking for. Hofmann got high off of showing
people his forgeries and them totally believing him, just like any other
charlatan in all human history. To put a more sinister motive on it, if
he sought to help the church and its leadership to make fools of
themselves, he had done so many times by the time fall 1985 rolled
around, the public just wasn’t aware of the extent of the foolishness
yet.

But, we can’t ignore the desperation, it must have had something to do
with Hofmann’s decisions, but maybe he was also doing it for love of the
game. His bounced checks and promising the same deal to multiple people
to the point of being punched in the face by an investor provides us
evidence that things weren’t so hunky dory in Hoffman’s world and
desperate circumstances were taking their toll, but love of the game
would help explain how he got into this situation in the first place.

This final part of discussion will take us to the end of this episode. I
was optimistic that we could cover everything in 2 episodes, but it just
doesn’t seem to be the reality. It should be pointed out that I’m
ignoring so many deals and newspaper clippings for the sake of
conciseness here. It would take us 4 episodes to cover every single deal
Hofmann did in as much detail as we discussed the Salamander Letter
deal, and each deal is more convoluted and epically orchestrated than
the last. I wish I could just do the rest of this podcast’s ten years on
Hofmann alone because he’s such a remarkable individual and the work he
did can’t be examined with enough detail.

And you know, I realized something; it’s weird to talk about a murderer
like this. If you listened to the first episode with the Sandra Tanner
interview, or you know a little Mormon history, you know what happened
next and it’s absolutely crazy. Some of you listening to this show were
members of the church when all of the news was breaking about these
incredible Mormon document finds with the name Mark Hofmann occasionally
cropping up. But what happened next was a plan, a premeditated and
destructive plan.

Hofmann had fallen through on a multiple deals by this point; his total
debts were $1.3mn. He was trying to buy a house, but the first payment
check for $195k bounced indicative of serious money problems. It’s
rumored that Steven Christensen knew that Hofmann was manufacturing
documents, although that can never be confirmed, but we do know that a
meeting was set up between Kenneth Rendell and Steve Christensen to
discuss the McLellin collection.

In the McLellin collection, Hofmann claimed that Facsimile No.2 of
Joseph Smith’s Egyptian Papyri was included. The problem with this
inclusion is the logistics of the forgery. Mark Hofmann could
manufacture old documents with old cotton paper, or pages ripped out of
old books, but when it came to ancient Egyptian papyri, there wasn’t
really any source material Hofmann could scavenge to replicate the
Facsimile without buying actual ancient Egyptian papyri. Hofmann bought
this 1<sup>st</sup> century papyri from Kenneth Rendell so he could
manufacture and deliver on Facsimile no. 2 as part of the McLellin
collection. October 11<sup>th</sup> 1985 was the day that Hofmann was
supposed to transfer the McLellin collection to Steven Christensen, and
on that day, Christensen had to track Hofmann down to even get in touch.
Turns out Hofmann was meeting with Gordon B. Hinckley that day to try
and sell him a Kinderhook plate with Joseph Smith’s translation, a story
for another day. The day for transferring the McLellin collection was
rescheduled to October 15<sup>th</sup>, the same day Hofmann was
supposed to close on his new half a million-dollar home in Cottonwood
area of SLC.

In the meantime, Kenneth Rendell was due to return home from his
honeymoon and meet with Christensen to talk about the Papyri in the
McLellin collection. Hofmann knew about this meeting and knew that it
would only take Rendell looking at the Papyri he’d sold to Hofmann who
turned around and forged the papyri into Facsimile no.2, to expose
Hofmann to the larger world of antique document collectors. Hofmann knew
if the meeting between Christensen and Rendell happened it was all over.

From initial appearances, it looks like Hofmann tried to target Rendell
upon his return from the honeymoon. Leslie Kress, Rendell’s secretary
took a phone call from a male caller claiming to be a Mr. Thornton. Mr.
Thornton claimed he was a good friend of Rendell and had a gift to send,
if he could only have Rendell’s home address. The secretary found the
phone call to be odd and refused to give the address; instead she hung
up and called the police to report the phone call.

Friday, October 11<sup>th</sup>, 1985 marked the beginning of a long
weekend for multiple people centered around Hofmann’s deals. I’m going
to read an excerpt taken from pages 266-269 of The Mormon Murders by
Steve Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. It was published less than a year
after Hofmann’s plea bargain was reached, and I think it captures the
chaos much better than I’ve described up to this point. There is a link
for the book in the show notes and I recommend following it to get an
idea of many first-person accounts of this troubling time in Mormon
history.

Mormon Murders extract

Hopefully we’re beginning to see what life was like for Hofmann. He had
promised too much and simply couldn’t deliver. He’d reached a breaking
point where he couldn’t deliver on the McLellin collection or any of the
other deals that were still in the works. The Library of Congress had
basically rejected the Oath of a Freeman by this point with too many
questions about its authenticity and how Hofmann had come to possess
such a rare document. Rendell and Christensen were about to meet and
talk about the papyri that made up Facsimile no. 2, which Rendell had
sold to Hofmann that Hofmann used to scavenge together the forged
Facsimile. Christensen probably knew that Hofmann was a fraud at this
point, but if Rendell found out it would blow the whole thing apart;
everything was chaos for Hofmann.

He was on the verge of being discovered by multiple people in multiple
ways all at the same time. He had been doing this run-around game we
just heard from the Mormon Murders book for too long and everything was
quickly approaching a breaking point.

Brent Metcalfe, who was working for Hofmann at the time attempted to
cash a paycheck for the amount of $1,000. This was a small fraction of
the money Hofmann owed Metcalfe, and he had been hounding Hofmann for
weeks about getting some money for his work. When Metcalfe tried to cash
the check, it bounced, and he decided to go to Hofmann’s home to demand
money for his employment.

On the evening of Saturday October 12<sup>th</sup>, Metcalfe and his
wife, Jill, went to Hofmann’s home, only to find him absent. However,
Hofmann’s wife, Dorie, was there and told them that he’d just gone to
his attorney’s office to write his will. We’ll come back to that.
Metcalfe called the attorney’s office and didn’t get an answer, which
seemed odd if Hofmann and his attorney were supposedly there working.

Brent and Jill Metcalfe left Hofmann’s home and went back to try and
revive Brent’s stalled vehicle, to no avail. Before going home that
night, they decided to swing back by Hofmann’s home one last time to try
and find him. Jill missed the turn to get into the neighborhood and
instead drove a couple of blocks down to turn around in the church
parking lot nearby. Lo and behold, Hofmann’s sky blue Toyota MR2 was
sitting in the corner of the lot with Hofmann sitting in the driver’s
seat. They pulled up next to the car and Brent got out of the car and
went and sat in the passenger seat of Hofmann’s car.

At the time, Hofmann had a bunch of papers in his lap that he
haphazardly threw face-down on the dash. Brent and Hofmann talked for
some time about payment, and Hofmann told Brent he had received a death
threat that day. A man reportedly told Hofmann that ‘You’re gonna die.
I’m gonna kill you.’

Brent found this somewhat hard to believe because Hofmann notoriously
never answered his phone, what are the chances that the one time he did
answer his phone that day that the person on the other line would issue
a death threat. Regardless, Hofmann seemed very agitated and stressed
which was uncharacteristic of him. Brent figured that the papers on
Hofmann’s dash were his financials, which would explain why he looked so
stressed and frustrated at the beginning of the conversation. To get a
proper idea for how much pressure Hofmann was under, this is an extract
from that same book we read from earlier, The Mormon Murders. It
quantifies Hofmann’s personal debt extremely well, but I think it’s
lacking somewhat because the values are all 1985 dollar amounts. I’m
going to read the excerpt with the amounts adjusted for today’s
inflation so we can get a sense of how much of today’s money Hofmann
owed. We know that Hofmann had a personal debt of $1.3 mn but this tells
us just how widespread his web of terrible business deals had reached.

“If Hofmann was going over his financial picture that night in the car,
it was no wonder his face showed signs of stress. In the next few days,
he would be expected to repay $1,017,952 to Wilding’s group, $382,440 to
First Interstate Bank, $44,800 to Shannon Flynn, $295,000 to Al Rust,
$22,000 to Lyn Jacobs, $12,300 to Brent Ashworth, $380,200 to
Shiller-Wapner, $243,800 to Ralph Bailey, $413,700 as a closing payment
on the “marvelously livable” house in Cottonwood, and $143,400 in other
miscellaneous debts, for a total of $2,958,113, plus if he didn’t pay
the Wilding group by the 16<sup>th</sup>, penalties of $8,950 per day.”

Nearly $3 mn in personal debt expected to be paid out in less than a
week’s time, yet the $1,000 paycheck, to Brent Metcalfe, had bounced.
Hofmann was not in control. He was stuck. He had made countless
promises, financial, antique documents, or otherwise, that he couldn’t
make happen. Let’s go back to something Hofmann did earlier, he made his
will, at least that was what he told Dorie he was going to that Saturday
night. Why? Why would he go to the trouble of making a will when he was
under pressure to do so many other things? People have used this as
evidence that he had plans to kill himself, I don’t want to try and
posit motives like that, but I think it does help us to get inside his
mind a little bit when we look at just how stressed Hofmann was this
Columbus Day weekend.

Sunday came and went, as did Monday. Steve Christensen had spent the
entire weekend with his pregnant wife to try and repair their dying
marriage and she felt like things were beginning to look up, even though
Steve was in the middle of bankruptcy filings and losing his business.

On Tuesday, October 15<sup>th</sup>, 1985, a woman named Janet McDermott
arrived at her office in the Salt Lake City Judge Building. She had the
office across the hall from Steven Christensen, who had recently moved
his business in to the building. She saw a small brown package outside
of Steve’s door with no postage or stickers, just the name Steven
Christensen in all caps written in permanent marker.

Steve arrived to the office just before 8 and picked up the package,
attempting to take it into his office and open it. Janet was on the
phone in her office when there was a deafening bang in the hallway.
Nails shot through her door and impaled the family portrait on her desk.
The nails from the pipe bomb ricocheted throughout the hallway and one
even bored through the wall and grazed Janet’s leg, drawing blood.
Initially, Janet thought there was a rifleman outside, but the explosion
was much louder than a rifle shot, then She heard a child’s whimper
outside and sprang into action.

She ran out of her office toward Steve’s office and found the hallway
badly damaged and his office door blown off its hinges. As Janet rushed
to the doorway, everything became clear. The whimpering that sounded
like a child was coming from Steve’s exposed chest cavity. His mangled
body was lying a few feet into the office, having been blown backwards
by the force of the explosion. In his last few breaths, Steve moaned in
anguish, waiting for death to overcome the immense pain from the
thousands of cement nails that had ripped through his flesh.

Janet began to whimper at the horrific sight in front of her, as her
friend lay bleeding out from the trauma of this expertly crafted pipe
bomb. Other people began to emerge from their offices nearby and Janet
yelled to the first person that emerged, “Get an ambulance\! Someone is
dying\!” After a few short moments of guttural moaning from the
mutilated form that used to be Steve Christensen, the torture ended and
he passed, falling as the first victim of Mark Hofmann’s 3 bombings.

Barely an hour later, another package was found at the home of Gary and
Kathleen Sheets. This package was probably very similar, having Gary
Sheets in all caps written on the brown paper with no postage or
stickers. Kathleen was the only one home and it exploded instantly upon
her picking it up from the wood footpath toward her garage, killing her
just as quickly and effectively as the first bomb had killed Steve. Her
mutilated body was found 2 hours later by a passing neighbor.

The news went crazy. Was it a terrorist attack? Was it a series of hired
assassinations from business deals gone awry? Nothing I could say would
properly describe the feelings of confusion and anxiety stemming from
these bombs going off in quiet, little Salt Lake City.

I’m just going to read a few excerpts I was able to pull up on Google’s
newspaper archives for that day. You can pretty much pick any paper at
random on October 16<sup>th</sup>, 1985 and go to the national news
section of that paper to find an article covering what happened in Utah
with the bombings.

October 15<sup>th</sup> marked an unusual day in American history. SLC
has always been such a nice quiet, urban city with nothing like this
ever happening before. People were quick to say that it was organized
crime because no regular Jack or Jane walking down the street could pull
off something like this. Hofmann was no regular Jack. He was smart,
calculating, and sadistic, with little to no empathy for the lives he’d
destroyed. He left the bombs out in the open, anybody could have picked
them up or stumbled over them, there was no assurance that the bombs
would hit their marks, showing a callous disregard for any human life.

After the bombs went off, Gary Sheets, as the known intended target,
went into police custody for protection. His wife had been killed and he
was probably still on the hitman’s list. Brent Ashworth, another person
who came up a few times in our timeline, was theorized as the next
target, and he, along with his family, was taken into custody for
protection as well. Unfortunately, to cap off this tragic string of
events, Ashworth’s son was out riding his bicycle when the police were
rounding up the Ashworths to take them into protective custody and a car
hit him, fatally crushing him. If deaths come in threes, there’s our
three for one day, because the next day would bring headlines of a third
bomb going off which critically injured Hofmann, but didn’t fatally
wound him.

The next afternoon, Hofmann was attempting to deliver the 3<sup>rd</sup>
bomb to an unknown target. The mercury switches he used for the pipe
bombs were very sensitive. Once armed, they’re meant to trigger with the
slightest jostle or bump. Hofmann parked his sky blue Toyota MR2 near 50
West and Second North a couple of blocks from the Salt Lake City temple.
He wouldn’t have driven there with it armed because a speedbump could
trigger the explosive, so once he parked he presumably armed the third
pipe bomb he planned to use on an unknown target. He must have left the
package on the passenger side floor of the car and got out of the car,
possibly to check the address of his target, or maybe to pay for
parking. He returned back to his mid-engined 2-door coupe and opened the
driver’s door.

This bomb was different than the one that killed Christensen. The bomb
that killed Christensen was surrounded with 2.5 inch concrete nails to
cause the most damage to fleshy humans possible. This bomb didn’t have
the shrapnel or nails, or else Hofmann wouldn’t have survived the blast.
This bomb was probably intended for a vehicle’s fuel tank or something.

Hofmann then reached for the bomb, with one leg out on the pavement and
his other leg kneeling on the driver’s seat. In grabbing the package, he
must have bumped it against the stick-shift, or possibly against the
passenger seat, and boom.

The force from the exploding gun powder inside the small pipe bomb
ripped the roof and doors off Hofmann’s car and threw him into the
middle of the road. Blood splattered across the street. His leg was
badly bleeding from his kneecap that was essentially blown off by the
explosion. One of his fingers was nothing but exposed bone, he had light
powder burn all over his chest and face, but he got off lucky.

People walking or driving by instantly surrounded Hofmann and dragged
him to the sidewalk to await the arrival of paramedics. The blue MR2 was
engulfed in flames. The fire department and EMT’s showed up to take
Hofmann ironically to LDS hospital and put out the fire. The police had
the block quarantined off as they brought in bomb dogs from the airport
to sniff around the car and the local area to clear it of other possible
explosives.

When they put out the fire, the police were worried that the water had
washed valuable evidence down the storm drains so they removed the
covers and went diving for charred papers that made their way out of the
cab and trunk of the car, including some fragments of ancient papyrus.

When Hofmann arrived at the hospital, they classified him in critical
but stable condition, and the police began to question him. As Sandra
said in our discussion last episode, he made up a story about a van
following him around, and that he was sitting in his car when the bomb
went off. None of those facts could be verified by police, and even more
Hofmann’s placement in his car didn’t make sense with the mechanics of
the bomb going off. If Hofmann would have been sitting in the driver
seat of his car and picked up the package, the blast would have been
contained enough inside the cabin of the car to kill him.

It’s like hitting a bullet with a hammer. I don’t recommend doing this,
but when you hit a cartridge with a hammer, the cartridge will fire and
send the bullet a few feet before it falls to the ground. In order for a
bullet to have killing power, the explosion from the cartridge needs to
be contained in the receiver and barrel of a gun. If Hofmann’s driver
door would have been closed with him sitting in the driver’s seat, the
explosion would have been much more contained and the energy from the
gun powder likely would have killed him. Instead, the driver door was
open and Hofmann was partly out of the car, so the explosion merely sent
him flying across the street.

Hofmann’s claim, that he was sitting in the car and picked up the bomb,
didn’t mesh with the crime scene, nor did the claims of a mysterious
white van. The police considered his faulty testimony to be probable
cause to search his home.

Up to this point, nobody was allowed into the basement of Hofmann’s
home. It was basically his laboratory, or some may call it his secret
lair. He was conducting all of his fraudulent business from the basement
of his home, where his document forge and rare book collection were
found. When the police conducted a search of the Hofmann home, they
found large amounts of scrap paper, many possible forged documents
Hofmann was working on, many vials of old fashioned ink Hofmann had
personally made, and various bomb making materials, along with his Uzi.
Now, the Uzi wasn’t connected to any crimes, nor was there any reason to
suspect that Hofmann would use it in the coming days, but it was illegal
to own an automatic weapon without a permit, and Hofmann was kind of a
gun nut. This Uzi actually served to be the legal stance the prosecution
took to hold Hofmann in custody until they could gather enough evidence
to consider him the primary lone acting suspect in the bombings from the
previous day.

The final thing the police found in Hofmann’s basement was a green
letterman’s jacket. This is important because a witness reported a man
walking into the judge building the previous early morning with a
package wearing a green letterman’s jacket, he even gave the police an
accurate description of Hofmann. The picture the sketch artist created
perfectly matched that of Hofmann the morning before the bomb went off
in Christensen’s office. Finding all of this evidence, the police were
able to return to the press and say they have the primary suspect in
custody mere hours after the bomb went off in Hofmann’s car.

Newspaper article like this were printed the following day, October
17<sup>th</sup>, 1985:

READ Albany Herald, NY Times, Daily News, Deseret News

Hofmann has been painted as many things. Criminal mastermind, killer,
murderer, master forger, bomber, all very negative terms, none of which
are false. I have a few words of my own that I use to describe him, and
I’ll get to those in a minute.

I want to ask a question that has no answer… What drives a person to
kill somebody? I consider myself a humanist in every sense of the word
and I can’t think of any situation where killing another human being is
justified or righteous. You might say, well what if somebody killed your
wife and kids and parents and brothers and sisters, would you be
justified in killing that person… no\! Nor was their killing of my
family justified in the first place, killing another human being can
never be considered the right thing to do. What if somebody says you
have to kill somebody or else they will kill your family? That person is
evil in the first place for threatening to kill my family… the loss of
human life is never a good thing, and the person taking that life can
never be justified in doing so.

The problem here is, I’m a rational human being and I can’t picture my
life ever being in a situation where killing another human being is
justified. That’s a product of my upbringing and current situation.
There are plenty of real-world situations where killing somebody is
justified within that situation. Living in Syria as a member of the Kurd
army holding off the advance of ISIS. Living in Russia and annexing
parts of Ukraine to fend off aggressive NATO expansionism. Living in
rough parts of Chicago or East LA when an invading gang does a drive-by
shooting of your homies crib. In all of these situations people find
themselves justified in killing another human being for the sake of
their own survival. Me, growing up in perfect little Bountiful, Utah
with nearly zero crime violence, and currently living in Seattle in very
affluent parts of the city, I’m not exposed to any of the situations
described, and I could never put my mind in a place where I could
justify killing another human being.

The problem with these labels I listed earlier is Mark Hofmann wasn’t a
murderer until October 15<sup>th</sup>, 1985. He was born in 1954,
that’s nearly 31 years he spent as not a murderer, only to be
remembered as nothing more because of a few rash decisions.

Let me wrap this into something contemporary for a second to try and
describe my perspective a little bit. I was watching a video online
recently of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and she told a little anecdote
that made me cringe to think about. She said that her and Donald were
walking down the street one day and Donald pointed to a homeless man on
the street and said, that man is $5 bn richer than I am, implying Trump
industries were that deep in debt. Come to think of it, it must have
been a John Oliver segment that talked about it. The point I’m making
is, Donald Trump has an army of lawyers. He agrees to terrible business
deals, usually leveraging other people’s money, and makes all kinds of
wild promises that he can never deliver on, and when his financial world
begins to collapse, he files for bankruptcy, as he’s done 6 times in the
last 15 years, and he somehow gets off scott free. He digs himself into
bottomless pits, declares bankruptcy, and the world is fine again, he
finds his way back to the top and builds more buildings with other
people’s money. The thing is, Trump deals in real money with real
estate, and his army of lawyers will always be there to find the proper
loopholes to save him when he gets in too deep.

Hofmann, on the other hand, dealt with real money, but dealt in fake
documents. He was selling a commodity that he couldn’t outsource or hire
out, he was solely responsible for his own success or failure. He dealt
in huge numbers, accruing a total of nearly $3 mn in personal debt from
his business deals spanning the 5 years from 1980 to 1985. When Hofmann
made deals to deliver on an old document, it was up to him to make good
on that delivery. There was no way he could file for bankruptcy and have
the people he’d already made deals with just back off. Filing for
bankruptcy may have relieved a little bit of stress with some of the
creditors, but it wouldn’t make anybody stop asking about documents he
had yet to forge. His bankruptcy wouldn’t stop people from asking about
the McLellin collection or the Oath of a Freeman, or really anything
else he was working on.

Sitting back and thinking about it, there really wasn’t any possible way
for Hofmann to get out of this without facing the music. The only
solution was to come clean, and nobody in the con-game does that, and I
don’t think Hofmann ever had the intention of coming clean. And if he
wasn’t going to come clean, and wasn’t able to relieve the pressure by
filing for bankruptcy, what could he possibly do to continue to provide
for his family the lavish lifestyle he’d created by continuing to do
what he knew and loved, no solution comes to mind.

Many have called Hofmann the greatest forger of our modern times. I
would argue that the greatest forger has never been caught, but that’s
neither here nor there. Hofmann had a passion and he was able to make a
very comfortable living by using his passion. He loved history, loved
old books and documents, and loved, even more, deceiving people. He was
amazing at his passions.

Since Hofmann refuses to meet or interview with anybody, we’ll never get
to ask him what was going through his mind. Whether it was manufacturing
the Anthon Transcript, selling the Salamander Letter, or hearing that
his friend, Steve Christensen, had been horribly murdered by a bomb he’d
created the night before, we will never know what was going through
Hofmann’s mind. What we can say is, Hofmann loved the game. In 2010, an
audio tape emerged from some of Hofmann’s belongings. This audio tape
includes one of his cons in action. I’m going to play it, and the audio
quality is terrible, but it was first played at a Sunstone Symposium,
and I’ll leave a link to the entire hour and 40-minute presentation so
you can listen to all of the audio that Hofmann recorded.

It starts out with Hofmann talking to a woman with the RLDS archive
collections department. He begins with saying this is Mark Hofmann of
Salt Lake City, you may remember me from the Anthon Transcript, and the
woman responds friendly. After that, he tells her he’s found a new
document that may be of interest to the RLDS church, the Joseph Smith
III blessing, which we talked about in part one of this show. He goes on
to read the entire transcript to her. She asks how he came to possess
such a letter, and he goes on to describe that it came from the Bullock
collection. After that he asks for a copy of the 1833 Book of
Commandments in exchange for the letter, which surprises the woman,
because the books are so valuable. But remember, this blessing that
Hofmann had forged stated emphatically that the RLDS church was the true
church in following Joseph Smith III after Joseph’s death in mid-1844,
so the blessing was quite valuable to the RLDS church as well. The only
reason I told you what you’re about to listen to is because the quality
isn’t great and it’s hard to understand at times. About 3.5 minutes in
you’ll hear some laughing, those are the people in attendance at the
Sunstone Symposium presentation where this originally aired.

Without further ado, this is the audio recording Mark Hofmann made
during his phone call to Madeline Brunson.

PLAY HOFMANN PHONE CALL AUDIO

Why did Hofmann record this? He was literally putting on record an
account of him bargaining to trade one of his own forgeries for a nearly
priceless book. Maybe, just maybe, this was his adrenaline spike. If
Hofmann was an adrenaline junkie like I talked about earlier, maybe this
was what made him feel alive. There’s a quote from him that’s found in a
1988 letter. This is what it says:

"As far back as I can remember I have liked to impress people through my
deceptions," Hofmann wrote in a January 1988 letter to the Utah Board of
Pardons and Parole. "Fooling people gave me a sense of power and
superiority. I believe this is what led to my forging activities."

Think of how surprised Madeline Brunson was when Hofmann read the text
of the Joseph Smith III blessing. She wasn’t even sure how to react, and
when he said he wanted to trade a Book of Commandments for it, she just
said “Oh, my” in complete shock at the request. That reaction must have
been Hofmann’s cocaine. That was what got him high, when somebody found
out he had something valuable and they were simply appalled by his
masterful deception.

There’s a remarkable image that can be seen online, and I believe it was
first published by the LA Times. I found it in a SL Tribune article, but
it’s possibly the most amazing photo of Mark Hofmann in existence. One
of his earliest “finds” was the Anthon Transcript that was supposedly
stuck between the pages of an old bible, we talked about it last
episode. This photo I’m referring to features 6 men standing around a
table looking at the Anthon transcript with the Pearl of Great Price on
the table next to it. From left to right the six men are Mark Hofmann in
his mid-twenties, N Eldon Tanner, Spencer W. Kimball, Marion G. Romney,
Boyd K. Packer, and Gordon B. Hinckley. The 5 highest leaders in the
church at the time are standing around the Anthon transcript that
Hofmann had manufactured in his basement weeks before, determining it to
be a legitimate document.

These 5 men were the most revered people in the Mormon church at the
time, supposedly ordained as prophets, seers, and revelators, and here
lies a photo of Hofmann deluding every single one of them. Hofmann grew
up his entire life revering these men as the leaders of the church, and
there he was, fresh off his mission convincing them that something he
forged was a real historical document. If deceiving people or tricking
them in some way was Hofmann’s crack, imagine what this moment must have
done for him, to be surrounded by the highest church leaders with a
camera crew and news team asking questions after taking such an iconic
photograph.

I doubt there was a single moment he had felt higher in his entire life
before this picture was taken, and all he could do was chase the next
biggest adrenaline rush by fabricating the next biggest Mormon document
find.

So what would I call Hofmann? This takes a lot of thought, because I
don’t want to stick with the tired terms he’s been called by so many
before. Murderer, bomber, madman, scum, forger, swindler, con-man,
fraud, coward, all of them are much too overused when describing
Hofmann. I hope it doesn’t sound like I’m venerating him or something
here, but what about genius, imaginative, creative, perceptive,
insatiable student of Mormon history, obsessively attentive to detail in
his work, a man capable of orchestrating massive business deals to get
whatever he wanted by any means necessary, and finally, Hofmann painted
himself into a corner where the only idea he could come up with to get
out of the situation was to kill people, thus gaining the label of
murderer.

This may sound like an odd way to take the conversation now, but the
Amazing Randi is a magician who made his name in exposing other
magicians or illusionists that claimed to have magical or psychic
powers. He’s exposed people ranging from Peter Popoff to Uri Gellar to
James Hydrick and many in between. Randi knows the game of deception,
but he comes by it honestly and tells you he’s a magician or illusionist
and his entire purpose is to deceive you. I can’t help but see some
parallels between Randi and Hofmann, minus the people dying bit, that’s
a pretty big difference.

My point is, as soon as Hofmann found out that the church was
suppressing information and documents about their convoluted history, he
embarked upon a decade’s long mission to expose this suppression. What
if what happened was Hofmann’s plan all along? Think about it, when a
corporate scandal involving millions or billions of dollars is
uncovered, it hits the media for a week and dies off as soon as a royal
baby is born or Justin Bieber flashes his junk to some people. This
hypothetical scandal involves corporations and millions of dollars, but
what if that corporation is a church, and the only scandal involves them
paying a few hundred thousand dollars for old documents, just to
suppress them or keep them out of the public eye? Two days after that
story hits somewhere in the B column of local newspapers, people don’t
care and they’re talking about how long it will take for Gorbachev to
tear down the wall, or the newest developments in the Chrysler workers
strike. Two weeks after it broke, the story of the church suppressing
documents would only stay alive in the hearts of the historians that
were affected by it.

As soon as you throw 3 bombs and people dying in little ol’ Salt Lake
City and possible corporate mafia hits into the equation, the story gets
A LOT sexier. Instead of just the Deseret News talking about an antique
document scandal in the B column of Tuesday’s paper, every news outlet
from the LA Times to the Albany Herald were talking about people dying
in explosions in SLC with connections to Mormon history, featured on the
front page for a week.

Call Hofmann whatever you will, but given his fixation with defrauding
people and how angry he was at the church for doing the same thing to
its members for over a century and a half, Hofmann seemed to have one
goal in mind; get everybody in America to talk about Mormon history by
any means necessary, and make the church and its leaders look foolish
while doing it. In that sense, I have one word to describe Hofmann…
Victorious.
