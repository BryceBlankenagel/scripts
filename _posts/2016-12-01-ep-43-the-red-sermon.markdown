Ep 43 - The Red Sermon

On this episode, Jo and Rigdon come riding into Farr West and decide to throw
over the whole game board that’d been strategically placed by powers much
larger than them over the past 5 years. First thing on the chopping block, the
heads of all dissenters

Welcome to episode 43 of the Naked Mormonism podcast, the serial Mormon history
podcast. Today is Thursday, December 1st, 2016. My name is Bryce Blankenagle,
and thank you for joining me.

The last historical episode that we had was a discussion with Mormon historian
John Hamer. He offered some much-needed perspective and helped to
contextualize some of the history that we've been studying recently. Well,
today we're going to dive right back into the timeline.

So let's get a little bit of a refresher of what happened on the last
historical timeline episode, so we can kind of just pick up where we left off.
So last timeline episode, that was episode 41, covered from January to March of
1838. And it spanned three separate locations during that small time frame.
The very first location, of course, was the church in Kirtland, from where
Joann Rigdon and Brigham Young had just fled in the middle of the night to
avoid detection. The church in Kirtland was amidst turmoil. Joseph Coe, Cyrus
Smalling, and Martin Harris had created their own Church of Christ, while
Warren Parrish had led an armed insurrection that pulled away his closest
members from the church. There were a small number of other break-off factions
that had begun and started up and kicked off out of the insurrection that was
going on in Kirtland. The second setting, of course, was Joann Rigdon's journey
with their families to Missouri during the worst absolute possible time of
winter. It's just terrible. Some of the stories that came out of this journey
from Kirtland to Missouri in January are just terrible, heart-wrenching
stories, because it was tough. It was really tough to get through the cold and
the snow and the rivers, you know, thwarting the frozen rivers and whatnot. I
think they just made people stronger back then. And then we have, of course,
the third setting, and that would be Farr West Missouri. The church leadership,
they were pretty much holding their own purge out in Missouri. Prominent
members, including the Whitmers and Ollie Cowdung, and many others, had their
memberships either revoked or put on hold until the prophet could come into
town to determine his truthful followers from the untrustworthy followers. So
that does it for the milk of today's episode, so let's just jump right into the
meat and continue talking about this goddamn train wreck.

Now, I know at the end of the last episode I said this week's episode would be a
discussion. Well, turns out that discussion is a lot longer than I expected it
to be, and it's going to be a full episode in and of itself. That'll be next
week's episode. Lindsay Hanson Park of Feminist Mormon Housewives was just far
too interesting to relegate to a small portion of a single episode. She
deserves her own episode. So next week, that's what we'll be talking about.

But let's get into this week because there's so much going on, and I don't even
really know where to start here. Now, what I mean is the church at this time
in 1838, Missouri, essentially, that's where we're focusing, is there's so much
going on, it's really hard to decide where to kind of pick up and what to focus
on and what to talk about. So let's begin with Joseph arriving at Farr West.
That happened on March 14, 1838. And then, of course, Sidney Rigdon arrived
April 4, 1838. So this is how long it took them each to get from Kirtland to
Missouri. And once they got to Missouri, they decided to really have a
tribunal to see who would be trustworthy. Who were the members that we could
trust in Farr West? Because the church in Kirtland had held its own
excommunication, essentially, and they had excommunicated Sidney Rigdon and
Joseph Smith. So the leadership, essentially, of Kirtland had been
excommunicated, and they were fleeing to Missouri. And there, they were going
to hold their own sort of tribunal to say, we are the leadership here, and
anybody that agrees with us can stay. If you do not agree, you are welcome to
leave. And what happened was a series of events that are quite telling in and
of themselves.

Let's talk about Oliver Cowdery for a second. This guy only has been with us
for such a long time. He's been a very important piece of the puzzle for the
entirety of the church, essentially. If not for Oliver Cowdery, the Book of
Mormon never would have been written down. The original and printer's
manuscripts never would have come to fruition. The Book of Mormon itself would
not have arisen if not for our good friend, Ollie. And there were some
tensions between him and Joseph at this time. Now, when we say tensions, we
can mean any number of things, and it's really hard to understand exactly how
their relationship dynamic played out at this time. But what we can do is look
at letters and exchanges that were happening between Oliver Cowdery and other
people at this time to see what their opinions essentially were. But Ollie...
In some ways, I've seen him as almost a reality check for Joe. When Joe would
have fantastical dreams about doing something, it seems like Ollie would be the
person that would translate that into reality. Whether it was saying, we need
a printing press, and we need you to start publishing a monthly journal, or a
monthly newspaper. Ollie makes it happen. We're going to found a bank, and we
need our own money. Ollie goes and he gets the plates, and he prints the five
million dollars in cash. I mean... Whenever Joe has some fantastical wish,
Ollie seems to be the person that translates that to making it happen. Or he
will say, Joe, we can't do this. And this is a time when I think his ability
to say Joe, we can't do this, finally overcame his ability to say, yes sir,
let's do it. Ollie, at this time, was very frustrated with Joe's intermingling
of church and state. Essentially, Joe was using the church as his own legal
body that was handling and transacting legal matters. They were holding
ecclesiastical tribunals in place of actual legitimate legal lawsuits and
trials. I mean, Ollie was part of this movement that I think he had a
fundamental disagreement with at a very base level. He'd say, you know, I
don't think that the church should have authority beyond just ecclesiastical
affairs. The church should only be able to control what happens in the church.
There shouldn't be a thick wall of separation between church and state. Of
course, this is from the minutes of the January 1838 letter. And it's out of
the Oliver Cowdery letter book.

And he says, Ollie says he was concerned that they were, quote,

> endeavoring to unite ecclesiastical with civil authority and force men under
> a pretense of incurring the displeasure of heaven to use their earthly
> substance contrary to their own interest.

end quote.

So when Joseph would say, like, to William Wines Phelps, hey, I have these
plots of land that I want to sell you. And it is the Lord's will that you buy
them. And then, of course, Double Dub buys those plots at a dramatically
inflated rate. And then Joe holds him to that debt. As soon as Joe says that
it is the will of God that you buy these plots of land, that's a big problem.
That's the point where ecclesiastical authority is influencing secular
transactions. And Ollie had a problem with it. So upon Joe's arrival, this is
when things really become, I would say, confusing and frustrating for certain
members of the church. When he arrived, we have this coming out, and it is a
letter by David Whitmer, D-Day David, W.W. Phelps Double Dub, and then John
Whitmer, John Goebel's Whitmer. And Oliver Cowdery was clerk of the high
council at the time, so he was the person who attested to it being a true copy
and everything. But this is the body of the complaint, and this is an actual
legal complaint that these people were filing against Joseph at the time. Quote,

> 1 FAR WEST March 10 1838
> Sir-- It is contrary to the principles of the revelations of Jesus Christ and
> His gospel and the laws of the land to try a person for an offense by an
> illegal tribunal or by men prejudiced against him or by authority that has
> given an opinion or decision beforehand or in his absence.
> 
> Very respectfully we have the honor to be,
>  DAVID WHITMER
>  WILLIAM W PHELPS
>  John WHITMER
> Presidents of the Church of Christ in Missouri 

End quote.

That's where we see the frustration coming in. These people were following
Joseph Smith because he was a prophet, but then he was coming along and saying,
I'm also the civil leader in the area. I'm also the mayor of Farr West. I'm
also the person who handles all legal tribunals. I am the judge of the area.
I handle any legal complaints that you have. As soon as all of those are united
into one person, it's tyranny. And of course, one thing that we cannot ignore
at this time when it comes to Oliver Cowdery's relationship with Joseph Smith
was Fannie Alger. The Fannie Alger affair happened, as best we can tell, 1836
is when it was discovered when Emma actually discovered Joe and Fannie fucking
in the barn behind the house. That's when we see this come out, 1836.  Right
now what we're discussing is barely two years and not quite two years after
that supposedly happened. And it serves to be a sticking point, a burr in the
relationship between Ollie and Joe. And we see that come out in Ollie's letter
to his brother Warren A. Cowdery in January of the year, calling the Fannie
Alger incident a dirty, nasty, filthy scrape. And that scrape was later written
over with the word affair.

Ollie had a problem with Joe's incessant attraction to women. I mean, Ollie
was violently opposed to polygamy all of his years. He would never join a sect
of Mormonism that was affiliated with polygamy. He had his own opinions about
the way women should be treated in the church, and I think that they were much
more fair-minded than Joseph. Joe just liked to do what he liked to do at the
expense of whoever or whatever. It didn't seem to matter much to him. But
Ollie was much more sensible in some cases. He seems like he was able to
disconnect himself from it and say, this is obviously not of God if Joe is
claiming that God told me that it was okay that I was fucking these women. And
Ollie had a huge problem with that.

Ollie and Joe did not see eye to eye on this, and it was a fundamental point of
disagreement in their friendship that I think probably served as a main
pressure against their friendship. It served as one of the main driving
factors that pushed Ollie away from the church. So finally, at the end of
March, there's a tribunal held, and essentially the Whitmers and William Wines
Phelps, Oliver Cowdery, and Lyman Johnson, and a small number of other
dissenters are excommunicated. Now excommunicated, this is kind of a tough way
to say it, because some of them were, some of them weren't, some of them were
just disfellowshipped or had their membership removed. It was kind of a messy
time. But in April at this time, Oliver Cowdery wrote his own letter of
defection to Joseph. And it reads in part, quote,

> This attempt to control me in my temporal interests, I conceived to be a
> disposition to take from me a portion of my constitutional privileges and
> inherent rights. I only respectfully ask leave, therefore to withdraw from a
> society assuming they have such right.

And that was the problem.

Cowdery saw this as an attempt to control him, to take away from me my
constitutional privileges and inherent rights. Ollie saw the writing on the
wall. He knew that Joseph wasn't going to stop doing what he was doing. He
knew that Joe was going to go off the rails soon. And he was smart enough to
jump ship before that happened. And this happened. In this horrible time of
turmoil, when Joe and Rigdon come back, they have to decide who is going to be
their new leadership. We had the presidency of the Missouri church, who were
D-Day David Whitmer, John Goebbels Whitmer, Double Dub Phelps, and then, of
course, Ollie Cowdung, who was clerk. These people were the head of the church
in Missouri.

And then Joe and Rigdon come in from Kirtland, having been excommunicated from
the church out there, and say, we're putting in our own presidency. We're
going to reorganize everything out here so we know who we can trust. That's
what happened. A purging, a cleansing of the leadership in Missouri. And Joe
never looked back. Now we have a very tumultuous time in Missouri here.
Because Farr West was essentially the main settlement where Mormons were
settling in Missouri. It was the central hub. But there were small other
cities that were being cultivated. DeWitt was one of them. We'll get into
talking about those probably in the next episode or the next few episodes.

But at this time, Farr West Missouri was the focus. This was the point where
they were establishing the church. The church presidency in Missouri had been
residing in Farr West for a couple of years by this point. But they decided
that this is going to be the new headquarters, essentially. And with these
people that had dissented, these people that had fallen away, these very
important individuals in the timeline had essentially left. David Whitmer,
John Whitmer, and Ollie Cowdung, these people had all resigned or been
excommunicated from the church by the middle of May 1838.

In fact, it wasn't just them. Here's a list of people that were excommunicated
by May of 1838. We have Martin Harris, David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and John
Whitmer, we talked about them. We also have Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page.
Hiram Page, who gave his own personal revelation about where Zion is. And Joe
had his seer stone crushed and turned into powder. Then we have William E.
McClellan, Professor Bill. Then we have Luke Johnson, Lyman Leadfoot, Lyman E.
Johnson, John F. Boynton, W. W. Phelps, William I. Phelps, we knew about him.
Then Frederick G. Williams, Freddie G. Williams. Those are just some of the
most prominent members in the leadership.

I mean those were people that were Quorum of the Twelve. Six of those people
were Book of Mormon witnesses. I mean six of the eleven Book of Mormon
witnesses were all excommunicated. That's absolutely absurd. The first
presidency of the church, the Whitmers and Phelps, they were the presidents in
Missouri. They were all gone. I mean how the hell does a church recover from
this? You just cleansed out half of the people that run the church in Missouri
and replaced them with people you think you can trust. How does the church
survive? By demonizing these people. Don't get me wrong, Ollie and the
Whitmers had good reasons to be fighting Joe. I mean Joe was overstepping
serious boundaries. He was intermingling church and state authority to the
point that there was no line separating the two. Joe was the leader of Farr
West. And Ollie and the Whitmers had good arguments against him. That we
shouldn't intermingle church and state. That he had been fucking over people
with the Kirtland Safety Society investments. That he had been fucking Fannie
Alger a couple of years ago and that was adultery, not conduct befitting of a
proper prophet of the Lord. So Sidney Rigdon helps insulate Joe.

Now this is my own perspective. This is how I'm looking back and seeing it
here, but I feel like Rigdon began to take very drastic steps in a way that
would insulate Joseph away from these people that were real dissenters, people
that were causing serious problems for the church. That were, I mean, even
publishing like public discourses and public letters to the church. That one
that we just read that was signed David Whitmer, Phelps, and John Whitmer, you
know, it's contrary to the principles and revelations of Jesus and his gospel
for the laws of the land to be intermingled, blah blah blah. That was an open
letter that was published publicly. A lot of people in Missouri saw and read
that letter. And, well, they still had good arguments.

Now of course at this time the Danites were not really organized because they'd
been organized, you know, a few months before this, but the Danites began to be
used at this point. They began to become very convenient, and very useful at
this point. I think this marks a turning point in our history. I gave D-Day
David Whitmer a nickname nearly two years ago when he was introduced to the
show. D-Day David Whitmer. It stands for Defection Day. And while we can't
sum up all of these people leaving in one day, I think we can point to one
small catalyst that can be seen as the single point where defection was the
only answer. Defection or agreement. You can either fall into line behind Joe
and Rigdon, or horribly enough, you can dissent. And who knows what happens
once you dissent?

Well, Sidney Rigdon knew what would happen. So on June 17, 1838, and I think
this is where Rigdon becomes the psychotic firebrand that we've been, he's been
hinting at for so long. I think this is the point where we can say this is
Defection Day, and this is the single point that required Defection Day to
happen. Defection Day happened three days after this salt sermon was given.
But this is one of Rigdon's most well-known and influential speeches. And it
was different from Rigdon's many other speeches in the sense that it was
proofread. They had written it out before he got up on the stand, as opposed
to most of his other sermons were just him standing up and talking.

The salt sermon was published.

They proofread it before he went on the stage, then he gave it, and then they
published it and sold it for, I'm not sure, I think 37 cents a copy or
something. You know, a quarter and a shilling per copy.

Now, there unfortunately aren't any full copies left in existence of the salt
sermon, but we do have quite a few accounts of people that discuss the contents
of it. This is taken from John Corral's _A Brief History of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints_, talking about it.

> President Rigdon delivered from the pulpit what I call the salt sermon.

_Now, this is quoting the salt sermon itself._

> If the salt has lost its savor, it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be
> cast out and trodden under the feet of men.

Now, that's the end of the salt sermon, but I'm going to continue quoting John Corral here.

> It was his text, and although he did not call names in his sermon, yet it was
> plainly understood that he meant the dissenters, or those who denied the faith,
> ought to be cast out and literally trodden underfoot. He indirectly accused
> some of them with crime.

End Quote

That's what happened. The salt sermon, that these people should be cast out and
trodden underfoot of men, because the salt has lost its savor, it's thenceforth
good for nothing. Now, of course, he took that from Matthew 5, but he built an
entire sermon on it, and it was a two-hour, apparently two-hour-long sermon
that blew people's minds, and it scared the dissenters. It made people truly
afraid for their lives.

Now, two days after that, two days after the salt sermon was given, Ollie
Cowdung, Leadfoot Lyman Johnson, D-Day David, and John Goebbels Whitmer fled
Farr West, headed for Richmond, Missouri. They ran the fuck away because
that's how scary this was. I mean, the Danites had been threatening them,
there had been various amorphous death threats up to this point, but finally,
Sidney Rigdon got on the stand and gave this salt sermon on June 17, 1838, and
said, the "salt that has lost its sermon", meaning the dissenters, "will be
trodden underfoot". I would be terrified if I were these people. I would run
so fast. This is horrifying to see this. And what is absolutely insane is the
fact that Rigdon ramped it up after this.

The salt sermon was just the beginning. The salt sermon was only dealing with
dissenters in Farr West, trying to get them out, chase them out. But on July
4th, holy shit, Sidney Rigdon gave his July 4th oration. And people know about
the salt sermon, and the salt sermon is powerful, but it only deals with
dissent, and people that were living in Farr West. But the 4th of July oration
was given to everybody. It was widely published as well, and we still have
many copies of it still existing. It was printed out of Farr West as well.
Now, I'm going to read this whole thing because it's fucking amazing. There's
no possible way that we can understand Sidney Rigdon *more* than by just
reading through this 4th of July oration.

Now, if you support the show through patreon.com/nakedmormonism, you're about
to listen to the entire sermon, the entire 4th of July oration. For those that
do not subscribe to Patreon, you're about to hear just a couple of intense
excerpts taken out of it. But the discussion afterward will still be the same.
But please listen at patreon.com/nakedmormonism.

If you contribute there, this episode is going to be a little bit longer. You
will be able to listen to the entire oration. And I really recommend it
because, my god, this guy was terrifying. Absolutely scary to have a person
preaching this from the pulpit. This is taken from the BYU library, online
library, and it is a photocopy. I'm reading it from a photocopy of the
oration. And this was printed in 1838. There will be a
[link](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/2816/rec/1)
for it on the show notes as a PDF of the actual speech as they were printed and
distributed. About 12 pages long. It's huge. Way bigger than I thought it was.
So, if you are a Patreon subscriber, you're going to get a lot more than what
the normal listeners get to the show. So, I hope that you share in the
enlightenment and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed reading it myself.

Alright. This is where it gets _fucking insane_. This is when it ramps up. And
of course it has to be for the final portion of the speech. Because, holy
shit. If he was getting the crowd riled up as Rigdon was want to do, this was
the time when he really brought this to an ultimate crescendo. And I can't
imagine that right now his dick could have become any harder than it was.
Because this is exactly what Rigdon was made for. This is why Rigdon is the
best preacher in all of Mormonism history. The most amazing preacher. Here we
go.

The people in Missouri hated the Mormons for this. This is a quote from
Ebenezer Robinson, included in Items of Personal History of the Editor,
published in November of 1889. Of course, Ebenezer Robinson at the time was
the printer in Farr West.

It said, quote,

> A copy of the oration was furnished to the editor and printed in _The Farr
> West_, a weekly newspaper printed in Liberty, the county seat of Clay County.
> It was also printed in pamphlet form by the writer of this, in the printing
> office of the Elder's Journal in the city of Farr West, a copy of which we

End quote.

I think this was a turning point. Before now, the Missourians didn't like
Mormons. They were frustrated by what the Mormons had done and by some of
their bullshit business practices, their land speculation. You know, they
didn't really like the Mormons. The Missourians and the Mormons were just not
very friendly to each other. But this is the point when they became hostile.
This is when they went from not liking the Mormons to, holy shit, we got a
serious problem in parts of Missouri. The Mormons are really becoming a
problem now. We have a Mormon standing up in front of a congregation of a few
thousand people saying, we will have a war of extermination between us and the
Missourians. We'll follow them to their homes and their families and every
drop of their blood will be spilled.

Now, just consider the possibility of
this. I've used this example before, but let's just say Abu Bashar Baghdadi or
somebody with a very foreign name to Americans moves to one of the plain
states, you know, Iowa or Kansas or one of those places that has just nothing.
There's nothing out there. Just grassland and cornfields and nuclear missile
silos. Just nothing out there. Absolutely nothing useful. And then this Abu
person begins to amass a following. It starts out with just him and a couple of his
friends and then they bring in a couple more of their friends and all of their
friends' families and their own families. And then all of their friends start
bringing in their extended relatives and their family and their other friends.
And eventually, you have an entire swath of two or three thousand people with
names like Muhammad and Abu and Bakr and whatever scary foreign names that so
many Americans are scared of at the time. What if Abu stands up on the stand
and says, we will kill all of the Kansans or all of the Missourians or all of
the Iowans for persecuting us? We will follow them to their homes, to their
families and spill every last drop of their blood. We will have a war of
extermination between us and them. How would people react today? How long
until that little commune of, you know, this religious commune would be
surrounded by tanks? Right? How long until something like that would happen?
Or they just drone strike the area. Oh well, it's our, you know, they're drone
striking American soil. Oh well, the people are brown and they have weird
names so it's okay. As long as they aren't white Americans on American soil,
we can bomb them. We can do whatever we want to them. Like this is simply
scary to think about because it's entirely possible that it could happen.

Now if somebody stands up on the stand and gives a sermon like this and nothing
happens, I'm not bothered by it. I'm bothered by the fact that it furthers a
bullshit persecution narrative but I'm not bothered by the fact that it didn't
go anywhere. In fact, I'm happy that it didn't go anywhere. However, if
somebody gets up on a stand and talks like this and then a few months later
there are rumors going around of fights and brawls and mobs gathering together
and fighting and shooting guns at each other, you know, things at this point
are escalating and there's no happy de-escalation in sight.

There's no way to knock off the level of escalation that has already happened
and Rigdon saw it necessary to blow this shit out of proportion, to go
absolutely apeshit insane with this. Now as I said earlier, the Missourians
didn't really hate the Mormons before this. They were more of an inconvenience
and a frustration and those people that believe in the wacky golden bible and
are destitute and poor and drive down real estate values when they go to an
area. That's all the Mormons were to the Missourians until this sermon was
given. Until this sermon was not only given but it was widely published and
sold and reprinted in newspapers and it gained traction. This speech went
viral because it was that fucking terrifying to have somebody like Sidney
Rigdon or Joseph Smith standing up leading a few thousand people and saying "we
will exterminate those who persecute us". That's fucking terrifying and how
would we react today? I mean there's no real analog to it that we can think of,
is there? I mean there's no proper analog to this. And given some of the Danite
actions that follow in the coming months after this sermon was given, the
people were right to be terrified. Joe was using the Danites as his own little
personal muscle squad. We'll have to get into this later just because it's so
fascinating. But this marks the beginning of the vilification of the Mormons in
Missouri. The beginning of when the Missourians said we really cannot deal with
the Mormons right now. They really are an actual problem. This is from the
_1838 Mormon War in Missouri_. It's a book by Stephen C. Lesueur on page 52.

Now he is quoting from the _Liberty Western Star_. It was published September
14, 1838 and it was reprinted in the _Missouri Argus_ September 27, 1838. This
is a direct quote from the book, _1838 Mormon War in Missouri_.

Seriously, if not for Rigdon's little bullshit 4th of July sermon, things would
have gone completely different for the Mormons in Missouri. There wouldn't
have been a Missouri and Mormon War, no Liberty Jail, no possibly being
reinstated to Jackson County, that whole idea just flying out the window. We
can point to this one fuckup by Rigdon and say that things would have been
drastically different if he wouldn't have escalated the situation. Thanks to
Rigdon's salt sermon and his 4th of July sermon, and I guess what you could
call the butterfly effect or something, American history is forever how it is
now. Thanks to Sidney Rigdon. Yeah, who knows how things would have played
out, how the history would have played out if Rigdon wouldn't have given the
speech. There's no possible way to ascertain what would have happened, right?
But this was an important speech because it set out the lines in the sand. It
said, we are the Mormons, we will not endure any persecution. Anybody that is
trying to persecute us will meet their death, essentially. That's goddamn
terrifying. Now, it wasn't just this preaching that Rigdon had done. It was
an amalgamation of so many things. Because once Joe and Rigdon got to
Missouri, they turned their ideas of aggressive expansion towards DeWitt and
towards the church that was just anywhere in Missouri at the time. They
figured, we got chased out of Kirtland, let's not let that happen again. Let's
establish a stable stronghold here and let's branch out to as many local areas
as we possibly can so that we kind of decentralize the power, essentially. So
that we can have many places that can be possible strongholds. Because that's
why Joe and Rigdon went to Missouri in the first place. Why they fled to Farr
West in the first place was because Kirtland was no longer safe from both legal
prosecution and internal dissent. The number of members that were trying to
take the church from Joe was astronomical. So they were running from that,
essentially, as well as from other lawsuits that were going on. Of course,
which ended up with the schoolhouse, the three-story church building in
Kirtland falling into the possession of Grandison Newell and it being burned
down by Lyman Sherman in January of 38. We talked about that a couple episodes
back. But there were so many other problems that the saints were having and
that even the Missourians were having with Joe and Rigdon. This is from the
autobiography of Ebenezer Robinson.

It says, quote

> on May 12, 1838, Joseph Smith Jr. and Sidney Rigdon went before the high
> council to appeal for financial assistance in remuneration for their services
> to the church, being reduced, as it were, to beggary as a result.

Yeah, well, of course, they just fled from Kirtland all of their possessions
and everything they owned. Joe and Rigdon were just as destitute as most of
the members of the church.

> The council, upon considering their request, instructed the bishop to provide
> for each of them an 80-acre lot of church property.

So just handed them 80 acres.

> And appointed a committee of three to work out with President Smith and
> Rigdon proper remuneration. Not for preaching or for receiving the word of God
> by revelation, neither for instructing the saints in righteousness, but for
> services rendered in the printing establishment and translating the ancient
> records, etc.

End quote.

Now, I'm going to read another line from that in a second, but that's
essentially what they were saying. We need money. We need some of that
internet money. Rigdon and Joe were extremely poor at this time. Not only
that, but they were under an immense mountain of debt. The church hadn't been
incorporated, so all of the church debts were in Joseph Smith and Sidney
Rigdon's name. Like, today, they would owe about 1.3, 1.5 million dollars in
today's money, and that was just personal debt that Joe and Rigdon had
accumulated. Now, that's what they were trying to say. Well, we need some
money. Because not only are we really poor, we don't have enough money to buy
anything, but we're also a lot of money in debt right now, so please help us
out. But, of course, being as violently opposed to priestcraft as Joe and as
Mormonism in general is, they had to find a way around it. They said, we're
not getting this money for preaching or for receiving the word of God or for
instructing the saints in righteousness. Instead, we are only receiving it for
services rendered in printing these things and in translating the ancient
records. That's it. That's the only reason that they had for this
remuneration. Now, if you're going to be a preacher in a local area, say it.
I'm a preacher. I don't have enough time to have a day job. Therefore, give
me money. Like, it's very simple. Most preachers do that. They're just
full-time ministers. But Joe and Reagan couldn't do that because they had
ensconced priestcrafting as being so evil and viciously of the devil in the
Book of Mormon and in many of their prints before now. So they always had to
find some way around it, and that's how they tried to do this. But Ebenezer
Robinson goes on to detail what they decided here.
It says, quote,

> The above named committee reported to the High Council, at a subsequent
> meeting, but the sum agreed upon is left blank in the history, as printed.
> The amount they asked for was ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS each per annum.

Wow! $1,100 per year. Now, rates of inflation, that was a fairly exorbitant
amount of money. I mean, people, very few people made more than $1 or $2 a
day, but Reagan and Joe were saying, give us $3 a day for every day of the
year, essentially, to get us up to that $1,100. That's horrifying. That's an
insane amount of money. Let me read the next paragraph in Robinson's
autobiography because it really is amazing. Please look at this thing in the
show notes because it's a great autobiography. It's really beautiful. And he
discusses a lot of these things from a first-person account, and that's what
this is. Quote,

> The question was warmly discussed by the members of the Council until near

Yep, priestcraft, there you go.

Holy shit. End quote.

So they called for this. For this $1,100 a year. The church pastor, the
leadership, the Quorum of the Twelve that had been re-established out in
Missouri, said, We'll give it to you, but George Hinkle, George M. Hinkle was
bitterly opposed to it the whole time. He was the one that dissented. And
then as soon as everybody else caught word of it, that Rigdon and Joe were
getting $1,100 salary for being the preachers of the church, people lost their
shit. Just lost their fucking minds. Because how can you claim to be a pious
holy prophet leading a church, railing against priestcraft, when you're asking
for $1,100 to rescue you out of the clutches of your own shitty business
practices? Like, that's absolutely absurd. And, and, tack on to this, the
church gave each of them an 80-acre lot out of the church property holdings. I
mean, I understand the church wasn't incorporated at this time, it was all
still under the name of Smith and Rigdon, but, like, still, that 80 acres, that
was church property, and they're just like, we're giving each of you 80 acres
and $1,100 per year. I can't imagine that people took this too well,
especially with the church in the financial dire straits it was experiencing at
the time. But of course, as we all know, when somebody like Joe or Rigdon
takes a step too far forward, they'll just take one step back, and say, sorry,
we're good, they rescinded that remuneration. But that doesn't say anything
about the last nine steps that they took forward before they took that one step
that was over the boundaries. And this was one point that caused frustration
with the Missourians, with the Mormons living in Missouri, against the
leadership of the church.

So we have the Salt Sermon and the Fourth of July Oration that are riling
people up, then we have Joe and Rigdon asking for money when they're extremely
destitute, that's riling even more people up. Now we run into another set of
problems that the Missourians had with the Mormons. This is taken, once again,
out of the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri, by Stephen Lesure. He says, quote, the
Mormons quickly became the dominant political force in the county. Now this is
talking about Davies County, by the way. By August, they numbered about
one-half of the 2,000 county residents and represented at least one-third of
the voting population. Ah, there's a problem. The Davies County residents did
not belong to the Democratic Party, but they would vote for any candidate who
they believed would protect their rights. They also tended to vote as a block
and therefore held the balance of power in the Davies election. The state and
county elections scheduled for August 6th stirred considerable excitement among
the Davies settlers because it would be their first opportunity to elect their
own county officers. So the candidates visited Diamond frequently. So,
Diamond was a settlement in Davies County, and it was essentially where Joe said
that Adam and Eve fled to after they were chased out of the Garden of Eden.
That was, of course, in Jackson County. They fled to Diamond. So that's
Diamond in Davies County. A few Mormons ran for the office so the candidates
visited Diamond frequently, making promises and soliciting votes. The
candidates focused their attention on Lyman White, who we know as General Lyman
White from the 1834 Zion's Camp, who was considered the most influential Mormon
at Diamond. Okay, so the population statistics. The Mormons were finally
becoming enough of a problem in Missouri that the Missourians were losing
voting power. And that is a big problem. When you talk about anybody's
ability to be American, their American duty is to vote for representatives they
feel will take care of and represent and address their concerns. That's the
most American goddamn thing you can do is vote, right? People vote. That's
all you have to do is fucking vote. It's not that hard. But when somebody's
ability to vote becomes threatened by the Mormons coming in, they take notice.
When there are enough Mormons living in an area that they can sway an election
for a Democrat or for a Whig, or for just anybody that goes to the Mormons and
said, I have your interests in mind, please vote for me, the Mormons voted for
that person as a block. They represented almost one-third of the voting
populace. They were almost one-half of the entire population in Davies County.
There were enough Mormons living in the area that the Missourians had to take
notice of this. And finally, when the Mormons come in and, let's say you're a
Missourian Whig, you didn't agree with Andrew Jackson, you don't like Van
Buren, you just don't like Democrats, you're a Whig through and through, a
blue-blooded Whig, whatever. You have a whole bunch of people moving in in
less than a year's time, and they are enough people that your horse isn't going
to win the race anymore. Your representative is no longer going to be elected
to their office to represent your frustrations. As soon as that happens,
that's like, that is a catalyst indicative of so many strong political
pressures that were pushing on the Mormons and the Missourians. I mean, I say
pushing on the Mormons, but like, they were pushing back and forth against each
other, the Mormons, the native Missourians, and the Mormons. They were
constantly butting heads, and this is where we see problems arising, because of
course, 1838 being an election year, as is every two years, people wanted to
feel like they were properly represented. The Mormons wanted to feel like
they'd vote somebody in that would take care of them, and the Missourians
wanted to vote somebody in who wouldn't be sympathetic to those goddamn Mormons
that are destroying their land, property values, and, well, essentially
creating a monopoly in DeWitt and in other places in Missouri that were, you
know, purely Mormon settlements, essentially.

Now, if you listened to the John Hamer interview episode, we covered a lot of
the history that I'm discussing right now. If you listened to the Sidney
Rigdon presentation episode that I gave at Sunstone, or if you watched the
video of it with the slides, you'll recognize a lot of what we've discussed in
this episode as being, you know, what was discussed very briefly during that
presentation. Now, we're trying to couch these things together. I'm trying to
build a cogent timeline that we can see these pressures slowly building up, and
this is where we see more pressures. I mean, we have the land ownership. We
have the Missourians chasing the Mormons out in 1833 and settling in Farr West.
We have Rigdon and Joe calling for the remuneration that the Mormons did not
like. We have them giving the Salt Sermon and the Fourth of July Oration,
which the Missourians really, really hated. And then we also have land values
to put in here. We have, with the Mormons settling in 1831 and being chased
out in 1833 so that they can't fulfill their two-year obligation to the
government, we see that happening all over the place. And the Mormons were
doing it back to the Missourians. Let's not make any bones about that. This
was a two-way street. It wasn't just the Missourians who were beating on the
Mormons. It was a constant conflict between an unstoppable force and an
immovable object. I mean, it's absolutely insane. But now we also come to
more land problems, land speculation. And John and I discussed this a little
bit during his episode, but when people were settling in new towns, they didn't
know if where they were buying property was going to be the new, you know, the
new Kirtland. You know, a huge central hub of trade and commerce, or, you
know, Chicago, I guess, or Rochester, or any of these larger cities that would,
you know, become well-cultivated and property values would skyrocket because
people would move in like crazy. Or they might just get something like Hiram,
or, you know, like one of these dinky little towns that just cropped up and
then eventually went away because there wasn't really anything there.

Now, people speculated on the land based on where they thought people were
going to buy and settle. You'd have a person that would buy a huge swath of
land, or, you know, chunks of land, and then break it up into smaller
settlements and then sell it to a small subset of people and say, Hey, move
out here, move all your friends out here, I'll give you a good deal on the
property, and then, of course, the property value will increase as more people
move out here. But if it ends up being a ghost town, then that's a lost
investment. You bought a big swath of land that nobody wants, and it's
valueless, essentially. So, the question of land speculation, the, I guess you
could call it an art of land speculation at the time, was very unknown. It was
still not known what would be the central hubs of trade and commerce.

Well, John and I talked about DeWitt in Carroll County, and this is taking
another passage out of the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri by Stephen Lesure. Quote,

> Trouble between the Mormons and Missourians began in Carroll County, not as
> an immediate result of the excitement caused by Sidney Rigdon's Fourth of
> July Oration, but because Carroll settlers objected to the Mormons'
> settlement at DeWitt. When David Thomas and Henry Root, both Carroll

> until after the sale. The citizens of this sparsely settled county, who
> numbered about 1,800, immediately protested with John Murdoch and George
> Hinkle, Mormon leaders from Farr West, moved with their families to DeWitt in
> early July.

Now, this is scary stuff, because the people in DeWitt, there were, you know, a
small number of people living there at the time, and these guys, Henry Root and
David Thomas, sold a bunch of property to Mormons in DeWitt. Now, DeWitt, up
until this point, wasn't much of anything. It was right on the Missouri River,
so that was nice because it was not that far from Jackson County and from
Richmond and from these larger cities that were central hubs. But of course,
it was up the river, and it was not very big. It wasn't really that important
of a town. But the Mormons bought it and said, this could be a big town. This
could be an amazing settlement where we have direct access, you know, right
down the river to Zion. We can control what trade is seen up and down the
Missouri River and what flows in and out of Jackson County. Now, the
Missourians, of course, knowing that the Mormons were buying up land in DeWitt
and Carroll County here, thought, well, hang on, the Mormons are buying up this
property, they're going to control that river. We don't like them, they don't
like us. What the fuck does that mean? Where does that leave us? Where are
we going to get our shit if the Mormons start seizing all of it from trade on
this river? What happens then? So, I mean, a number of questions were
cropping up that were causing people to become very scared of the Mormons. And
of course, they began moving into Carroll County at the beginning of July, just
after this Fourth of July oration was given by Rigdon saying that we will kill
the Missourians that come against us. It will be a war of extermination. Man,
all of these pressures coming together is terrifying. I can't imagine being a
believing Mormon living through this time, having the Missourians constantly
pressuring the Mormons to not be where they are or to settle in a different
area. If they can't settle in Caldwell, then they'll settle in Clay. If they
can't settle in Clay, they'll settle in Davies County. If they can't settle in
Davies, they'll move out to Carroll County. John Hamer and I did talk about
this.

When Whitmers and Double Up Phelps and all the cow-dung were out running the
church in Missouri, especially Double Up Phelps and the Whitmers, they had an
agreement set out with the Missourians that we'll settle in Caldwell and Davies
counties, in Liberty and in Farr West, and those will be our towns. Those will
be the Mormon towns, the Mormon counties, essentially. We won't bother you.
You don't bother us. We're good. And I think John just described it as like a
handshake agreement or like a gentleman's agreement, right? Well, this wasn't
good enough for Joe because when Joe came in, he excised the members of the
church that had that agreement. So suddenly the people that were in Jackson
County and other counties in Missouri that were not friendly to the Mormons but
had this agreement with the Whitmers and Double Up Phelps, they're like, oh,
well, those guys are gone, and Joe and this crazy Rigdon bastard are in here
talking about exterminating the Missourians, and now they're moving out and
settling other cities? Now they're buying up land in other counties? They're
violating our agreement, our gentleman's agreement. So that was another
pressure that was pushing on the Mormons and the Mormon leadership that the
Missourians really didn't like the Mormons for. Now at the end of 1837, we had
what was organized The Brother of Gideon Society, and it was, sorry, at the end
of 1836, beginning of 1837, when the Church was organized when the Kirtland
Safety Society was organized, they also organized The Brother of Gideon Society
essentially at the same time, and they were the archetype for the Daughters of
Zion, which were referred to as the Danites. I'm going to read a little
passage out of Ebenezer Robinson's autobiography again, and he discusses what
was one of the final main pressures that caused tension between the Missourians
and the Mormons. Quote,

> After having gone through with the form of a trial by
> the High Council, the cases of David and John Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, William
> Winesfeld, and Lyman E. Johnson were disposed of, and Joseph Smith Jr. and
> Sidney Rigdon had written that unfeeling letter to John Whitmer, unbecoming of
> gentlemen, much less professed saints, and after having that remarkable
> revelation stating that Farr West was holy ground, a society was organized by
> the Church members, at first called the Daughter of Zion, afterwards Danites,
> or from which came the secret order called Danites, to be governed by the
> following purported Bill of Rights and Articles of Organization.

Now this is the title of that article, it's Bill of Rights of the Daughters of
Zion and Articles of Organization. And he lists out the entire Articles of
Organization of the Danites. Now I don't want to get into them because that'll
be another two hours of talking about them, but the Danites were essentially
the extra-legal force for Joseph. Now we've heard references to the Danites,
I've mentioned them quite a few times in the show. This is the time when the
Danites actually begin to exert influence and become an important piece of
this puzzle. This is from page 46 of the _1838 Mormon War in Missouri_. Quote,


> One other point deserves mention, beginning in early September, the
> Missourians wrote letters to Governor Boggs,

that's Lilburn Boggs

> and printed articles in local newspapers describing the militant nature of

End quote.

There's no way we can understand this from our perspective. Let's go back to
that analogy from earlier. Let's say this Abu al-Bashidah guy, or whatever I
said his name was, is leading this, you know, this commune of three or four
thousand people, and then claims that he has a militia, his own mob of a
thousand, let's say a thousand armed men, are ready to enforce the will of this
religious sect, of this, let's call it a religious cult. Now, let's say if Abu
had set up this Islamic caliphate, essentially, in Iowa, Kansas, wherever, and
people had taken notice, but they didn't want to say or do anything, because
Abu and his people weren't really breaking any laws. Particularly, they're just
not white, and they just don't have American names, and they don't worship the
Christian god. You can't march on them, you can't bring an armed mob up against
them, you can't reign any of their leaders in for tyranny or for treason if
they just do that. They're only exercising their religious freedom, their right
to speech, their right to practice any religion that they choose or none.

But as soon as Abu stands up on the stand and says, this is what we have
planned, these are the people that we will kill if they come upon us, it will
be a war of extermination, we will follow them to their families and to their
houses and kill them and spill every drop of their blood, and Abu has a 1,000
man strong army, armed with all kinds of guns, grenades, who knows what, you
know, the cutting edge of technology at the time were cartridge guns at the
time, if I'm not mistaken, I mean, they were just converting from good old
shot, black powder guns to actual cartridge guns, and I would assume that if
they were doing that, that some of these men had them, so you know, what's the
pinnacle of armament technology that typical people can own today? Let's just
say every one of these 1,000 men had Armalite AR-15s, you know, fully loaded
with holographic sights and portable grenade launchers and all kinds of really
scary, intense stuff, you know, stuff that we only see in video games or in the
armed services, if any of us serve, what if these 1,000 men are armed with all
of that? They are marching around in uniform and practicing drills and target
practicing. You know, more than 1,000 men, or more than 2,000 men that are
ready to march and fight at a moment's notice.

There's no way to understand what this was like. We can't put ourselves there,
we can't understand what it must have felt like to be the Missourians watching
this Mormon cancer growing in Missouri and slowly engulfing more and more
counties and becoming weaponized and militarized, ready to fight or kill
anybody that opposes them. And the scariest part is, the Danites, they weren't
just this idle type of amorphous shadow agency that was meant to just scare
you. They were used. The Danites were employed by Joe and Rigdon in order to
sway their own political leanings, in order to cause certain things to be done
that they thought should be done. Of course, I can't talk about those now
because we'll have to go into those next episode.

Maybe that's what the next historical episode will be, is just, we're going to
begin with reading about the Danites, founding the Danites, the Articles of
Organization, and then talk about exactly how this weapon was used in the hands
of Joe and Rigdon in order to cause political strife. It's endlessly
fascinating.

You know, I'm looking back on this time, I can't help but think,
Joe and Rigdon were fucking idiots when it came to running a church. I mean,
there are so many great ways to run a church that don't involve amassing an
army and giving a speech that says, "I'll kill everybody who comes against me".
Like, that's not the way to run a church. It's the way to run an insurrection,
you know, an actual militaristic uprising. I mean, many changes in political
spheres were brought about by one man or woman saying things just like Sidney
Rigdon had done with an army of a thousand or less people behind them. I mean,
many political changes that have happened throughout all of human history have
been waged with nothing more than what Joe and Rigdon had in their pocket
already.

But it was so flashy, it was a grandiose way of doing things. If
you're going to incite riot and persecution and people fighting publicly in the
streets, this was the way to do it. Rigdon and Joe did an amazing job of
creating this facade of being a pariah to the Missourians, to the native
Missourians living in the area. And the Mormons just being refugees there were
not seen as hostile until Joe and Rigdon made some of these certain steps
towards militarizing these people, towards organizing the Danites and using
them, towards giving speeches saying that we'll kill all the Missourians that
come against us. I mean, it's a great way to make headlines. It's a great way
for people to take notice, to stand up and take notice and think about the
Mormons and what Joe and Rigdon are doing. But it's not the way to get actual
things done. Because the more energy and fire that Joe and Rigdon were adding
into the system, the more frustration and energy it was giving back out to
them. I mean, it was this positive feedback loop of crazy, of escalation, of
intensity, and viciousness that didn't let up. The only way that it was solved
was by locking these people up, by throwing them in prison for a few months. I
mean, that's the only way.

Like, this did not de-escalate at any point. There's no point that we can step
back and say, it's a good thing that Governor blank did this. That Governor
Carlin or Boggs or Joe or Rigdon or anybody in a leadership position, or
Brigham Young, there's no point we can say, they did that and that's a good
thing because it de-escalated the situation. It stopped the armies from
marching against each other. At no point in all of this history did that
happen. It only became worse every day. It only became more self-destructive
and stupid and downright absurd as the days passed. Nothing got fucking better
from here. Only, things only became worse. Everybody, whether you were just a
typical Mormon living, breathing under the yoke of Joe and Rigdon, you know,
being protected by the Danites, whether you were just a typical Missourian,
whether you were in the leadership of the Missourian government or the Mormon
church, every single person was affected by what happens here. And we have a
lot more to talk about in Missouri before we actually get to the standoff that
led to Liberty Jail. That will happen in a couple of episodes because there's
still a lot more to discuss.

Still so much going on. We still have to talk about the foundation of the
Danites and who they are, what they are, and how they were used. But all of
this together just shows us that nobody knew what they were doing. The church
had its time of being the firebrand crazy cult that people would forcibly
persecute. Mormons were tarred and feathered and beaten in the streets and
shot at and whipped because the leadership of the church. They had their
firebrand phase. They had their coming out of their own mold phase. We have
them falling into their proper way of lying phase. In the early 1900s, Utah
was gaining statehood, and the twins of barbarism, polygamy, and slavery were
outlawed. And they stopped practicing polygamy. The church was hitting its
PR-friendly stride at that point. Which makes me think about what the church
does today. Like, they're so goddamn smart now. They already had their phase
of the persecution and the fighting and the armies that are marching against
other militias. They had their time in the spotlight of doing that, and
nothing good came of it. Now the church decides to move with money instead of
with armed people, instead of with mobs. The dollar is more powerful than the
bullet. Public opinion is more important than what you can get one or two
firebrand parishioners to do for you. And the church's moderation wins out
every time over zealotry. And the church knows that. They're fucking
brilliant at it. I mean, we've seen in just the past few years, very small
political moves that the church has engaged in. Political or monetary, either
way really. The two are so tightly interwoven, they're basically synonymous at
this point. We've seen their moves when it comes to acquiring new land or
building new church houses and new temples in places that don't fucking need
these massive, white, Victorian, Gothic-almost-looking buildings that don't
serve any purpose but for people to do rituals in and say passwords and secret
handshakes. It's the only reason why those fucking things exist. And the
church still puts them up at an incredibly alarming rate because they're smart
about it this time.

Farr West was dedicated as a holy land. They were going to build a temple
there, but they didn't live in Farr West long enough to do it. They went the
firebrand way. They went the fuck-you-we're-doing-whatever-we-want kind of
way, and they were squashed. They were squashed over and over again. The
Mormons could not win with going the crazy way, so they decided to go the way
that could win. And we see Brigham Young creating the foundation of that by
moving the saints out to a place where there is no policing. Nobody can keep
him in check. He's the power. He's the undisputed king of Zion. And as that
happens, I mean, Brigham Young runs into a fair amount of mob and militia
violence as well, but he handles it much smarter, and he moves on from that.
And he continues doing things in a much more businessman perspective, much more
of a business mind to it as opposed to a religious firebrand or a religious
zealot. And Brigham Young was necessary in order to keep the church going.

At the end of the Rigdon presentation that I gave at Sunstone, I gave a quote
by Wycliffe Rigdon. Wycliffe, of course, was Sidney Rigdon's son, and he said,
I can find, I'm paraphrasing, I can find no fault with the church doing what it
did and following Brigham Young because my father was in no state to lead a
church. He was crazed by sickness and mental health disorders. He was, he had
a bilious temperament, which means he was usually sick, usually vomiting, and
unable to even leave the house, probably from malaria, and a bit of his manic
depression as well. And every time that Rigdon tried to run a church for any
extended period of time, it usually collapsed on him, or shit changed, like Joe
coming in, and then things are completely different forever.

I mean, Rigdon never really ran a church by himself as his own Rigdonite church
for longer than a few years successfully. He was not a fit leader. Brigham
Young was. Brigham Young was the leader. And we can look at like the, maybe
the Strangite church today or something, you know, one of the churches that
follows more of a prophetic bend, one that claims that they have the one true
revelation, and they are much smaller, they are a subsect of, you know, less
than a thousand people at this time, that would, I assume, that would claim
themselves as part of the Strangite Mormonism. But you have somebody like
Brigham Young that comes in and runs this shit like a boss, like a businessman.
Well, we see what the church is today. We still see the vestiges of the
Brigham church in the LDS Brighamite church today. Brigham didn't run it like
a church. He ran it like a goddamn business, and that's how the church is run
today. And that's how they really get shit done. By throwing around money and
politicians and judges and public officials. Throwing around people and money
and influence in ways that don't ever involve a gun or an army or a fiery
sermon from the pulpit.

Everything that the church does now is all behind closed doors. We don't see
any of it. And I say the church here as like this amorphous, you know, demonic
entity in and of itself, but it probably doesn't operate with as much
solidarity and direction as I'm trying to vilify it with right now. But that
being said, we still see the church operating in political and monetary spheres
that it shouldn't belong in. I mean, why the fuck does a church need a
five-billion-dollar shopping mall? Why does it need a multiple hundred million
dollar amusement park in fucking Hawaii? Why does it need another
multi-billion dollar shopping mall in fucking Florida? Why does the church
need so much of what is not church-related? It doesn't. It just has it. It
doesn't need any of those things. It doesn't need any of the thousands of
subsidiary companies that operate under the umbrella of the corporation of the
president of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church
doesn't need any of that shit, but it has all of it. And when it has all of
that, it has more power and influence on all of those things. So what we see
on the very face of Rigdon and Joe in 1838, that they were, they were villains.
They were opposed to the status quo of the Missourians. They were, they were
the enemy. They were that crazy religious guy that just decides to do whatever
he wants to say that it's in the name of God. They do the same thing today,
but they just don't broadcast it from the pulpit. They just don't say we're
going to kill everybody that opposes us from the pulpit. They don't say any of
this. They don't act this way anymore. They act with money and power. And I
would argue that every single time that a corporation or a single entity
decides to act with its dollar, as opposed to using its members with guns in
their hands, I think that's a lot more terrifying. When there's a standing mob
of a few thousand people with guns in their hands, you know who your goddamn
enemy is. But when nearly every elected official in Utah is a believing
Mormon, when most judges are, when most people walking along the streets in
Utah are all members of the church, they don't realize that they're small
pieces of this massive entity that exerts influence through them. The church
is so smart today. It's so smart.

And it's more terrifying now, I would say because we no longer have that mob,
that standing mob of people with guns that we can call enemies or that we can
say are in the wrong. Now it's like, who does the church influence? Who do
they exert their influence on? And how is it done? It's all in the shadows.
It's all behind closed doors, and none of us see it today. So take whatever
church you want. We can have a church like the Joe and Rigdon Mormonism, that
if they were acting the way that they acted in 1838 today, they would be
surrounded by tanks and, you know, flown over with drones constantly, and they
would have all kinds of public opposition. There'd be probably, you know,
various militias that form outside that are not part of the military that stand
there armed waiting for some kind of big battle to break out, you know. Any of
these, like, the three percenters or sovereign citizens or whatever that you
could picture being at one of these standoffs, you know. Do we want that
church, where there's a clear line in the sand, who's doing what, what's going
on, and why we're scared of them? Or is it better to just be constantly
chasing a ghost, and yelling at a multi-billion dollar entity that doesn't seem
to give a shit what anybody says about them, and just exerts its influence and
does whatever it wants, just because they have the money and power to do it? I
mean, really, who is a better enemy? If you have to pick one of these enemies,
which one is better? I don't know. I don't even know how to answer my own
question. Which one is really better? Obviously, we see which one gets more
shit done. One gets the leadership thrown in jail, the other one gets the
leadership of multi-million dollar houses in downtown Salt Lake. I mean, the
church is smart enough to see which one is more effective. Hopefully, we are
too. Would you prefer to get a letter that reads like this?

> To Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, William Muntz, Phelps, and Lyman E. Johnson,
> 
> Greetings,
> There are no threats from you, no fear of losing our lives by you, or
> anything you can say or do will restrain us.
> For out of the country you shall go, and no powers shall save you. You shall

End quote. Do we want the church issuing that kind of rhetoric to dissenters?
Or do we want them to just excommunicate us? Fuck, I don't even know how to
answer that question. I'm so conflicted. And I guess it's not that simple,
right? It's not like it's an either-or. It's not like the church either has
to act this way in violence and vengeance and warning people to depart or a
fatal calamity will befall them, or it has to operate as this shadow, demonic,
evil entity that doesn't, you know, this amorphous being that moves and sways
people according to its will. I guess it doesn't have to be either-or, really,
does it? I mean, the church is made up of the people that attend it. I mean,
even the crusty old fuckers that run the 15 offices at the highest level, even
those guys, like, they are still believing members in this church. I'm sure
that many of them have read this stuff before and know what I would be talking
about here, and I don't think that acting in this way is necessarily out of the
realm of possibility for the church today. They just find so much more success
in acting the way that they do, in running these through, you know, having the
same type of idea in a letter and then running it through a team of attorneys
to have it, you know, changed into proper legal speak. I mean, they get a lot
more done now, and the church wouldn't be what it is today if not for their
current business model.

And I guess I'm most excited about what the next few episodes hold with Brigham
Young, because we want to talk about the Danites and what happened with Liberty
Jail and Joe and Rigdon being locked up because that creates a vacuum that
Brigham Young can step into and manipulate to be the office that he wants it to
be. The Quorum of the Twelve essentially rises to be the leader in the absence
of Joe and Rigdon, rightfully so. That's what Joe put the Quorum of the Twelve
into place for, to run the church in his absence. And that's when Brigham
Young becomes bloody motherfucking Brigham. That's when he becomes the leader
that the 1847 pioneer trope needed to lead them to Utah.

I'm so excited for this. I just fucking love Mormon history so much. It's so
good. This stuff is much better than fiction. You cannot make this shit up.
And I'm glad that I've had access to people like John Hamer and Lindsay Park,
who have been able to shed light on these situations and help inform me on what
I'm studying here. I'm reading about these situations across multiple books,
and I'm starting to piece things together, but just to sit down and talk with
somebody that knows how all of this played out, to put this into context, I
think is so incredibly helpful. And it helped me a lot. And it helps to offer
a sense of direction through which this podcast will wade through this
wasteland of historical confusion and competing narratives. And I'm elated.

I'm stoked about the next few episodes because this is an intense time in
Mormon history. Not just Mormon history, we're approaching the Missouri Mormon
War, the Battle of Crooked River. We're talking about things that actually
have an impact on the greater history of the American continent. And that's
the most exciting part of it. The people that experience this, we're reading
the first-hand accounts from people like Ebenezer Robinson in this episode,
that actually experienced that. They're actually here during this time to feel
what we are reading about, to understand what it was like to be living in
Carroll County when mobs were marching on the town, threatening the Mormons
with violence. It's sad that we can't put our minds there now. We can't see
what it was like. But we can use these accounts to offer some level of
insight, slanted as they may be. And it's still amazing. It's wonderful to
read through these accounts. Oh, the Danites. I'm just reading another
passage on them here. The Danites are amazing. I cannot wait to start to get
into them, because that's when Lyman White and George Robinson and Porter
Rockwell, and a few people really come into their own. So be watching now for
that next episode, the Danites. And, you know, some people say that the
Danites exist today as a shadow society. I don't know where they're getting
that from or what they're using as a basis for that, or even if it's possible.
But I've heard people say it. Maybe we'll jump into that someday. Seems
absurd, right? We will never know.

And that is it for the historical portion of this week's episode.

Need to thank a few new patrons who signed up to support the show at
patreon.com/nakedmormonism. First, we have new NAMO juvenile delinquent
Katrina and Christopher. Thank you both very much. Also, we have a new NAMO
adolescent rebel Dean. Dean and Christopher and Katrina, thank you all very
much for supporting the show at patreon.com/nakedmormonism. Your support is
very deeply appreciated. And really, to all of the patrons who support the
show. Now, I don't do this, I don't think, ever really, but there are some
people, of course, that have either been patrons for a long time or have been
pledging a certain amount that has made it so that their lifetime pledge has
been a lot. And all of these people, I just want to thank directly so much. To
all of you, I guess we can call you the movers and the shakers. Many of you
have been signed up from the very early ages of this podcast, and the amount of
support that you have given to allow this to become what it is is incredibly
appreciated. But me offering thanks and appreciation at the end of an episode,
that's, you know, it's only in response to what, to the kindness that all of
these people have exhibited. And, I mean, it seems so lacking in a certain
respect. And what I want to do to try and thank all of the supporters of the
show is by trying to make it better. Now, that's hard to say, because on a
scale, a spectrum of better or worse, a podcast is, you know, it changes from
episode to episode. Oh, this was a good episode. Oh, this episode was utter
shit. So it's really hard to make the podcast itself better or worse in a
certain respect. Because it fluctuates so violently from one end of the
spectrum to the other every episode. And even sometimes in the episode, oh,
that was a good part of it. Oh, the rest of the episode sucked. I mean, you
know, that one part, that one quote was really cool, but I don't want to
necessarily make the show better. I want to make my ability to communicate
better. And I think that's probably the most important point.

Because this podcast began as a project, as a hobby of me learning Mormon
history and sharing it, because I love the truth of it. I love learning about
this stuff. I love being able to understand the history in a little more
context. I feel like so many people don't, and that's just terrifying. I want
to spread knowledge as much as possible. And that was kind of the impetus
behind the podcast, but it's evolved into so much more now. I want to become
the best possible Mormon history communicator that I can be. And why am I doing
that? Well, because I talk to people about Mormon history frequently. And
oftentimes I feel like I'm just talking and talking and talking. Nobody, the
person on the other side of the conversation isn't listening. And that's a
failing in my own ability to communicate. Now, if I'm going to communicate
Mormon history, I need to be able to do it effectively and well. And the only
way to do that is by practicing. I've recently had an idea occur, and it's come
from a fair amount of self-reflection and trying to understand the direction
this is going. And what I mean is, I have a bit of a personal failing when it
comes to communicating Mormonism and Mormon history in a face-to-face type of
setting. I mean, I talk into a microphone, into a computer screen once a week,
and I am able to communicate my thoughts that way. But that's nothing like a
conversation. And that's where I think, personally, I have a bit of failings.
And maybe some of you can relate on this.

You know, I have conversations with TBMs on occasion. And it's fun to have
these conversations, but it feels like there's this wall of knowledge that
neither of us can really breach very well. And maybe some of you have had the
same reaction. I get to a point where it feels like I'm just talking at the
person, and, you know, they've put up a defensive wall, and nothing is getting
through. We're no longer having a conversation. And that's something that is
very challenging for anybody to do, I think. And I feel like I struggle with it
especially, but if my entire career is built on communicating Mormon history, I
have to be able to communicate that. But it's not just necessarily the career,
it's that this is an important life skill that affects my relationships with
everybody. And maybe some of you can relate to this as well. Being able to
articulate thoughts and important Mormon history in a non-antagonistic way, I
think, is a fantastic resource that's underutilized. When we may talk to our
loved ones that are on the other side of the belief spectrum. Oftentimes the
entire subject is just so taboo, it's hard to even broach and start, you know,
breaking the ice to get into the discussion. So, you know, us having as much
knowledge of Mormon history as we have, it's kind of hard to get to the point
where that knowledge actually becomes useful in a conversation with a loved
one. And maybe this is something that I'm wanting to strengthen in myself, you
know, personal communication skills. And it's something that we can all benefit
from if we are all able to increase our ability to communicate Mormon history
with another individual.

So this is kind of the idea that's coming forward out of this. If people are
interested in it, you know, patrons especially, I'm hoping to get some feedback
on this. I'd love to set up maybe like a Google Hangout or something where we
can get together, get on the line, and sit and talk about Mormon history in
ways that it is beneficial or ways that are detrimental to conversation. You
know, it's important to think about what we want out of the conversation as we
go into it. You know, do I want to just get mad at this person or is it better
to actually have an open, honest, intellectual discussion with this person?
What do I want? And there are different communication techniques to get
different outcomes out of those conversations. So maybe that's something that
would benefit everybody that chooses to participate in this. And, you know,
hoping to have a little bit of feedback on this, if this is something people
are interested in doing, please let me know. Please get in touch.
NakedMormonism at gmail.com. And, you know, if that's something that turns out
to be successful and people like it and we feel like it's something we want to
perpetuate, like we did really derive benefit out of it, then, you know, maybe
we could turn it into like a monthly hangout or something like that. It can be
a goal of some sort. But beyond that, I've had other thoughts occur. Maybe it
might be beneficial to, like, go sit outside of the Institute building at
campuses or something like that with, you know, a camera and a microphone. And
maybe it would be possible to get some people that are coming in and out of the
Institute building to engage in a conversation about Mormon history. You know,
that could be really fun and compelling and, you know, beneficial in learning
how to properly communicate these broader historical topics to people that need
to know this. Especially believing Mormons that have to, that need to know this
information. I mean, I want to spread it as much as possible. And what better
way to do that than by talking to Mormons face to face? So, I'm looking for
some possible advice that people might have to give on those or on other
possible ways that we can exercise our communication ability that will
hopefully make it so we're more capable of engaging in meaningful discussions
about Mormon history as opposed to just, you know, talking at each other,
talking at people about it. You know, who knows? But this is all just, I'm kind
of throwing it out there, seeing what sticks.

I would love to hear some feedback on it, so let me know what you think.
NakedMormonism at gmail.com But all of that being said, I don't want that to
minimize the impact and the contributions that everybody has made to the show.
Whether it is contributing an email voice, some listener correspondence,
whether it's contributing on patreon.com or through PayPal or, you know,
monetary donations. Or just listening, even just listening to the show. You all
make this possible. I couldn't do this without all of you. Because you are the
best listeners ever. Simple as that. And I would be willing to contend with any
other podcaster about that, any time. That being said, I really do appreciate
all of you so very much. Next episode is going to be a discussion episode with
Lindsay Hanson-Park of Feminist Mormon Housewives Podcast. Under the umbrella
of Feminist Mormon Housewives. Of course, she did Year of Polygamy and she's
working with Color of Heaven Podcast as well. And she is an amazing history
communicator and works tightly with the Sunstone Symposium. An amazing person
and I really look forward to the conversation with her next week. And we'll
also do a listener mail segment on that episode. Had to do patreon
appreciation this one. Next episode we'll do listener mail. And hopefully
we'll get in some more correspondence on that.

Also, we'll discuss what happened with the Sidney Rigdon episode on Facebook
next episode. Because there has been a little bit of discussion about the
presentation I gave at Sunstone. From people that are calling Rigdon a zero and
basically a piece of shit. And I take serious dramatic issue with that with
every one of them. So, if I remember, we'll talk about that next episode as
well. I really hope so. Need to close down this episode for tonight.

It has been a long one, but hopefully you've hung in there for all of it.
