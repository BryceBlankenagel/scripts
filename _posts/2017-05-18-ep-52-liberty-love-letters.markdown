Ep 52 – Liberty Love Letters

On this episode, we view the Mormon exodus from Missouri to Illinois
through the eyes of those locked up in Liberty Jail. Jo and Hyrum try to
run the church from their dungeon, while Rigdon is trying to reestablish
the Mormon kingdom which was lost. Jo has letter correspondence with his
wife and Presendia Huntington Buell at the same time. We finish, as
usual, with random musings about Hingepin Rigdon and his belief in a God
that would dare to cause him such personal suffering.

Welcome to Episode 52 of the NMPC, the serial Mormon history podcast.
Today is Thursday May 18, 2017, my name is Bryce Blankenagel and thank
you for joining me.

Last episode we covered what happened to Jo, Hyrum, Rigdon, Caleb
Baldwin, Alexander McRae, and Lyman Wight once they were incarcerated in
the Liberty Jail in Clay County Missouri. The situation was bleak for
all. Jo and Hyrum, brothers behind bars, were concerned with what was
happening to the saints as they were being removed from Missouri during
that harsh winter. Rigdon was oscillating between states of manic
complaint about the situation and being nearly non-verbal in the throes
of depressive episodes. His mind was on the breaking point and he was
dragging everybody else in the jail ever closer to insanity with him.

Finally, Jo and friends appeared in front of a judge on a plea of habeus
corpus with Alexander Doniphan representing everybody but Hingepin
Rigdon. Then, because everything turns on this guy, when Rigdon,
representing only himself, addressed the court from a reclined cot in
his sickly state, He turned everybody’s hearts into complete mashed
potatoes and they all cried for his release. Rigdon organized an
elaborate escape attempt with the prison guards in case any Missourian
vigilantes planned to take care of him upon his lawful release. The
night of the escape, Rigdon feigned a scuffle with one of the guards and
booked it down the road, leaving his wife and son-in-law behind, only to
pull a gun on his son-in-law when they caught up. Rigdon spared no
horseflesh in getting to the Illinois side of the Mississippi over the
next few days through backwoods roads to elude any possible vigilantes
he may have encountered. Realistically, the vitriol the Missourians held
for the Mormons was still a force to be reckoned with. The Mormon
leaders were in constant danger of a lynching, which likely would have
been swept under the rug in the wake of the Jacksonian bully-majority
democracy which had only been manufactured over the previous 9 years.

Let’s talk on that for a minute. Obviously, the Missourians got what
they wanted by the time Rigdon was making his way to Illinois. All
along, the Missourians just wanted the Mormons out of their counties,
and preferably their state, and they had the quasi-legal surrender terms
enforced by General John B. Clark which forced the Mormons to leave. By
early February, the majority of the Saints were either in Illinois, or
were in the process of getting to Illinois. Very few Mormons remained in
Missouri by the end of winter in early 1839. But the sentiments and
public outrage that led to the Mormons being removed in the first place
still burned fervently in the minds of the anti-Mormon Missourians. They
had escaped without losing any major leaders and without any major loss
in life, and that made many of these Missourians quite happy with the
situation. It would take a few years, but eventually people began to
realize that the Mormons had been totally screwed over legally and had
no allies, but no recourse would be attained for anything that happened
in Missouri. And, let’s face it, Jo and friends never really paid for
what they did. They were never in a subsequent civil court after this
court of inquiry to determine legal prosecution, they spent a few months
in a jail, then escaped, that’s it. They Mormons were never repaid for
what the militia inflicted upon them, but they also never paid for what
they inflicted upon the state, which included assaulting a
state-sanctioned militia with deadly force, among many other illegal
activities. The Mormon leadership was deserving of a harsh sentence for
anybody responsible for the Mormon’s actions in Missouri from August to
October of 1838, but nobody really paid for it. The whole situation was
largely ignored and swept under the rug.

But those are details we’ll be discussing this episode, so let’s get
into the meat for today having consumed our fill of milk.

To set the scene, Rigdon had very recently settled in the makeshift
half-way camp of Quincy, Illinois and was the presiding church leader
while Jo and Hyrum continued to languish in Liberty Jail. Last
historical episode we focused on Rigdon quite a bit, this episode will
be focused more on Jo and Hyrum Smith, along with their 3 friends locked
up in Liberty Jail. We’ll still be talking a little about what Rigdon
was doing on the outside to provide context, but our main focus is on
Jo’s experience. We’re going to see what it was like for Jo without
snapchat and twitter to get updates, he could only rely on the hearsay
of visitors and letter exchanges.

It was dark and very cold inside Liberty Jail. The dungeon had already
essentially driven Rigdon mad to the point that he was released, but
that still left Jo stuck in the dungeon with 4 other people,
languishing, wondering, hoping that things would change soon. The men
are struggling to cleave to their sanity as the jail only seems to get
smaller, closing in on their waning sense of reality while being
completely disconnected from the outside world.

The jailers do their job, but they can’t stop the people from coming up
to the window and yelling at the prophet, “where’s your gold bible now?”
And “when it comes time to release you fellers, we’ll see if we can’t
get a little justice from that tree branch over there.” Their voices
echoing through the darkened stone room with nothing but some
matted-down straw and the prisoner’s fearful minds to absorb the
blasphemy and death threats.

Out there is so much to do, so many people to converse with and items of
business to attend. In here, just terrible food, crushing boredom, and
idle time for deep self-reflection. This was the longest Jo had ever
spent in jail before. He’d had his few run-ins with the law prior to
this point, but none of those resulted in jail time any more than a few
days. At one point, Joseph Sr., Big Daddy Cheese, spent a month in jail
back in 1830 for a $14 debt he owed to some wealthy guy, but his month
is jail was nothing like what his son was currently going through in
Liberty.

The worst part of it all, nobody knows how long they’d be here. They had
made their appearance in front of the judge and Rigdon got off, but
Doniphan couldn’t do diddly-shit for Jo and friends to get them
released. They hadn’t even had a real trial and sentencing yet, they
were just being held as the state prepared its case against the Mormons,
or more realistically, waited for them all to leave so they didn’t have
to deal with it. There was no telling if Jo and his friends would be
there for another month or another 10 years; fear of the unknown must
have been utterly soul-shattering.

It’s probably a good thing that Rigdon got away though, Jo was sick of
hearing his constant bitching. All of the men were going through the
same physical turmoil as Rigdon, they just didn’t complain as much. But,
Rigdon is a good guy, and he’s helped Jo since they teamed up in early
1831. He knew how to run a church and he took Jo under his wing. Jo has
been a smart and worthy apprentice, even if his sense of adventure has
occasionally gotten them in many small bouts of trouble. You know, if
not for Rigdon, Zion would never have been declared as Independence, MO.
If not for him, none of this business with the Mormons in Missouri would
have happened. Wait… Is that good or bad? Good thing the trusted Bloody
Brigham Young is in Illinois saying stuff like this from page 230 of
vols 3 of the History of the Church A Source and Text Critical Edition
edited by Dan Vogel.

> “About this time, Prest. Brigham Young proposed to Bishop Partridge to
> help the poor out of the State. The Bishop replied, “The poor may take
> care of themselves, and I will take care of myself.” Prest. Young
> replied, “If you will not help them out, I will.”

Jo knows he can trust Bloody Brigham, but is Rigdon still trustworthy? I
mean, he did just feign an escape and leave his wife and son-in-law
behind as he sprinted from the jailhouse. Maybe he can be trusted, but
can he be predicted? Obviously Rigdon was going to look out for the
Saints, but what would he do without Jo there to keep him in check? If
Rigdon does start to make a power-grab, what happens then? Would Bloody
Brigham and the quorum follow him because he’s not in jail? Fear of the
unknown must have been strangling the prophet’s synapses.

A mere half-month after incarceration, Jo sent a letter to the Church in
Caldwell County dated 16 Dec 1838. It basically tells the church that
everything is going to be fine, keep believing in us, we’re just being
persecuted like the big J was in J-town. Here are some excerpts taken
from the Joseph Smith Papers.org:

> “To the [<u>church of latter day

> are afflicted in divers manners for christ’s sake and the gospel’s,
> and whose perils are greatly augmented by the wickedness and

> and that he will save our souls. We do not care for those that kill
> the body they cannot harm our souls; we ask no favors at the hands of
> mobs nor of the world, nor of the devil nor of his emissaries the
> dissenters.”

He even takes a minute to disparage some of those who testified against
him during the court of inquiry a month prior to when this letter was
penned.

> “Look at the dissenters. And again if you were of the world the world
> would love its own Look at [<u>M</u><sup>r</sup> <u>\[George M.\]

> Corrill</u>](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-the-church-in-caldwell-county-missouri-16-december-1838/1#8053978671179538137) Look

Then the letter goes on a screed about how the incarcerated individuals
are totally innocent and the fact that they are only in there because
George Hinkle sold them out for his own immunity. Then it goes on to
talk about the “mobocrats” who were warring against the Saints in
Missouri in the first place.

The letter ends with a bunch of preachy dribble, no doubt exhorting the
church members to be faithful even though they were actively being
driven out of Missouri at that very moment. After reading the entire
letter, there are no explicit instructions to the saints with the
exception of telling them to remain in Far West for a time, and calling
a few Mormons out specifically for betraying the leadership. Actually,
there is a pretty good passage about D-Day David Whitmer.

> “This poor man who professes to be much of a prophet has no other dumb
> ass to ride but [<u>David
> Whitmer</u>](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-the-church-in-caldwell-county-missouri-16-december-1838/1#12675504851207726184) to

> sufficiently so but what he brays out cursings instead of blessings.
> Poor ass whoever lives to see it will see him and his rider perish
> like those who perished in the gainsaying of Core, or after the same
> condemnation.”

Oh, how the tables have turned. The Whitmers used to be trusted leaders,
scribes, and historians for the church, and now David Whitmer, one of
the three witnesses, is called a dumb ass who wouldn’t open his mouth in
the face of danger like Balaam’s ass did.

Granted, there were Saints coming and going, frequently visiting the
prophet and his acolytes in their dungeon. We don’t have any way of
tracking all the people that came and went, but rest assured, the
prophet and friends weren’t perfectly lonely during this time. We can,
however, begin to understand the little singularities of order amidst
this vast battlefield of chaotic forces acting upon each other. Heber C.
Kimball and Bloody Brigham were given charge of the Saints in the
absence of Jo, Hyrum, and Rigdon. This is the next correspondence
emerging from Liberty Jail, 9 days before the Habeaus Corpus hearing
where Rigdon was released.

This letter had a few more directives in it, but it was still really
hard to know what was happening to the Saints at the hands of still
zealous mobocrats who were constantly giving them trouble. The idea of
moving to Illinois was still not in the minds of the Mormons, they knew
they had to get out of Missouri, and the only options they had were
Illinois, Iowa, elsewhere in Missouri, which seemed very unlikely, or
they could retrace their steps back to Indiana or Ohio. They had been
chased from Kirtland by the church there but Jo and friends still wanted
to go back, so they held it as a possibility while imprisoned,
specifying to Bloody Brigham and Heber Kimball that Saints can come from
England if they just send their money to buy plots in Kirtland first.
They had no allies remaining in Kirtland. They couldn’t stay in
Missouri, novel solutions needed to be considered. But Jo still didn’t
understand what was happening in the winterscape that lie beyond the
walls of Liberty Jail.

The next letter to be dictated in the echoing chamber of sickness and
bodily smells was to the Missouri state Legislature detailing the
problems the Mormons had with the trial. This was essentially the letter
which got them into the habeaus corpus hearing where Rigdon preached to
his release, but they do bring up some important points concerning Judge
Austin A. King who’d been the presiding judge over the Court of Inquiry
back in November, 2 months prior to when this letter was sent.

They have some relevant points, and by extension, relevant complaints.
There really wasn’t any question about Judge King’s partiality
considering the Mormons, he hated them… simple as that. The incarcerated
leaders knew this to be an injustice in violation of a fair trial, which
hadn’t even happened yet because the Court of Inquiry wasn’t even an
actual trial. They wanted to be heard again in court in a different
circuit where Judge King wasn’t presiding, or even present. They really
hated Judge King, which goes way back to the hearing they had on
Raglin’s farm back in like August or something.

The prisoners were finally fed up. Rigdon had just been released in that
little bullshit escape attempt thing, and the remaining 5 prisoners had
dealt with enough of the terrible food and abysmal living circumstances.
With the mysteries of what was happening on a day to day basis outside
of the jail constantly bearing down on Jo and Hyrum, they needed to
regain control as the Mormons were amidst their mass exodus towards
Quincy, Illinois. They had been told, not in any written correspondence,
but by word of mouth, that Illinois seemed to be friendly to the refugee
saints and that the quorum of twelve had been organizing parties to make
the journey, but all the details were too vague to really know what was
going on.

Finally, they attempted an escape, unsuccessfully. No writings exist
during February of 1839, likely because the Mormons were simply too busy
organizing and moving during that month to take the time to sit down and
write to the prophet and friends. The escape attempt around February
6<sup>th</sup> was thwarted by vigilant prison guards, however, their
second escape attempt happened in early to mid-March. This is from the
history.lds.org article concerning their escape attempt and Caleb
Baldwin’s reaction to the prison guards doing their job.

Everybody was on edge. They wanted out but the jail was built too well
for them to realistically effect an escape. That auger was used to make
a hole in the wall, but since there were loose-pack rocks between the
inner rail-road tie boards and outer brick structure, the hole they made
to try and widen the window just filled in with more rocks. The second
escape attempt was obviously foiled, but Jo was happy he’d cost the
state a round sum of money in damaging the jail. While this served as
some little consolation to Jo’s sufferings, he and the 4 others were
still stuck in the jail with no possibility of escape for quite some
time. They continued to share correspondence with church leaders
throughout March, but not a single word was written between Jo and
Rigdon during this entire incarceration.

Jo was in regular contact with Bishop Edward Party-Boy Partridge during
his incarceration, but wasn’t actually there himself to meet with people
and make personal assessments of their character. Party-Boy was keeping
him up to date on relevant dealings. This a few small excerpts from a
letter written by Party-Boy Partridge on 5 march 1839 from Quincy to
those still incarcerated in Liberty Jail. I’m going to read the majority
of it because it queues us in on a few things that were going on in
Illinois with only Rigdon to be a representative for the church
leadership. Remember, these letter exchanges and occasional visits were
the only way by which the Mormon leadership could know of what was going
on outside their confinement. They only knew what other people would
tell them, and Party-boy Partridge was one of those few connections.

That letter told Jo some very crucial information concerning what the
church leadership, and specifically Rigdon, were all doing while he
continued to languish in the smoke-filled hellhole with his 4 closest
friends. What is important is something we’ll pick up soon. The opening
paragraph told of a bunch of church leaders gathering together to meet
with a man named Dr. Isaac Galland. We know what happens with this guy
and what was going on outside the jail, but remember, Jo and company had
blinders on; they couldn’t see past the two little porthole windows
offering a small view and very little fresh air to the men locked in
this cage not fit for vermin. We’ll pick up with Isaac Galland soon.

Let’s continue reading more letters to and from Liberty Jail so we can
put ourselves in the darkened cell with the Mormon leadership, looking
at the outside world through these letters.

The next written correspondence to enter the melancholy walls of the
prison was a letter written to Jo and Hyrum by their younger brothers,
Crazy-Willy and Don Carlos Smith. This was the only real way Jo and
Hyrum figured out how their families were doing. It must have been pure
anguish to only hear these little snippets of information hurriedly
scrawled down by people who were too busy to care what Jo and Hyrum
would direct from the jail cell. These people were going about their
very hard lives with the prophet and his closest counselor absent, why
did they still need the prophet? Why did they even need to take the time
to write to him?

When this letter was penned on March 6<sup>th</sup>, the Smith family
were obviously amidst a fair amount of toil and discomfort. The exodus
from Missouri to Illinois was in full swing and the majority of Saints
were settling in the tiny little township of Quincy, Illinois, forcing
an area with accommodations for a few families to balloon to inhabit a
few thousand Mormons as they disembarked from the ferry across the
Mississippi.

The next day Jo received a letter from his wife, Emma. I’ll let the
letter speak for itself, but remember, visitors and letters were the
only connection these men had to their families and the only way they
could tell if they were doing well or if somebody had fallen to some
great calamity.

I can’t imagine what it must have been like for Jo and Emma, not knowing
how each other is doing. But, luckily, they did exchange letters. Jo
wrote back to his wife two weeks later on 21 March 1839. I won’t read
the entire thing, but here are some highlights.

An interesting detail to point out, it took Jo 2 weeks to write 3
paragraphs in reply to his wife after she sent her heartfelt letter
telling how much she worries about Jo. Oddly enough, Emma expressed her
affection for Jo and how much she yearns to be with him again; none of
these sentiments are reflected by Jo in his return letter. It took him 2
weeks to write back to his wife, was he busy? He was spending every
waking moment laying on beds of matted down straw or sitting at a desk
writing and he just somehow couldn’t find the time to reply to that
letter? That’s not completely fair because the letter took a few days to
get to him, but the reason I point it out is to shine a spotlight on
another letter that Jo wrote during the interim period on 15 March 1839,
and this was addressed to Presendia Huntington Buell after her visit to
Liberty Jail. This is how it begins, along with a few excerpts that
illustrate the overall tone of the letter.

> “Dear [<u>Sister</u>](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-presendia-huntington-buell-15-march-1839/1#8382930314945037912)

Well, you guessed it, Presendia would become one of Jo’s wives in
December of 1841 shortly after he’d married her sister, Zina Huntington.
Read the entire letter for yourself, it’s in the show notes. At the time
of her death in Utah she had the full legal name of Presendia Lathrop
Huntington Buell Smith Kimball having two children by Heber Kimball.
We’re really starting to near those years where Jo was frequently
associating with many women who would later become his wives. Consider
the timeline of letters entering and leaving Liberty Jail. Emma wrote a
letter to Jo on 7 March, Presendia visited Jo in the jail on 15 March,
and immediately after her departure, Jo wrote a letter to Presendia
telling her how much he enjoyed her visit, then 6 days later he finally
replied to the letter his wife sent, neglecting to detail how much he
misses and loves her. It almost makes you wonder if this was a conjugal
visit.

I mean, you make your own assessment of the situation because I’m just
looking at the timeline and content of the letters and making my own
judgement. I don’t think they actually had any intimate relations in the
jail, but given how shitty it was in the jail, it makes sense that being
visited by one of his crushes would perk up the mood of the prophet in a
jiffy, and then motivate him to write a letter as soon as this hot
little 28-year-old crush was done visiting with them.

The common line has it that polygamy became a thing about 2 and a half
years after this scenario, but did Jo court and polygamously marry women
he’d never met before? NO\! His wives were all people he was friends
with, or were the daughters of people he was friends with. Are we to
believe that Jo wasn’t courting these women long before they were
officially sealed to him? Remember, this is two and a half years after
Jo was supposedly found by Emma in the barn with Fanny Alger.

While there is no way to truly understand what went through that man’s
mind on any given day in any given situation, I think putting the
timeline and content of these letters into historical context offers a
brief insight to the personality of Joseph Smith.

Let’s take a step back and think about that for a minute. What else did
Jo have to be excited about? What else was going on inside the jail that
was worth living for? The conditions were prohibitive to any positivity,
much less human life, yet these men were still locked away for months
with nothing but visitors and letters from which to derive any pleasure.
All the men could do was spend their days fantasizing about life outside
the walls of that forsaken goddamn prison and they latched onto anything
that could offer the intangible feeling of connectedness to the outside
world. When Jo was writing to Emma, he was reminded of how he was
separated from his children, one of whom was quite sick. He was further
reminded of how his bad decisions may have led his friends and family to
suffer endlessly, wallowing in destitution. Emma signified his
real-world responsibilities.

Contrast that with how Presendia’s presence must have struck Jo. She was
the hotter, younger, more exotically featured, and more ignorantly
credulous connection Jo had to his previous life long before the
responsibilities of cult and family were constantly crushing him. She,
Fanny, Nancy Marinda Johnson, all of his crushes made him feel alive and
carefree again at a time when he was looking for an outlet to serve his
addictive personality and insatiable hunger of greener pastures, or
shaved pastures, I don’t know what Jo liked…

It only takes a tiny bit of foresight a mere 5 years in the future to
see where his endless appetite for women left him, but the problems
which led to the Carthage shootout are often ignored or simplified. He
had a lot to wrestle with in having 30 plus wives. Women were
essentially the center of his attention for about 4 years which
polarized the public and caused other things which needed Jo’s attention
to slip away or be handled by other people. Presendia visiting Jo in
Liberty Jail marks a point in Jo’s history where he prioritized one
exhilarating aspect of his life over the crushing responsibilities in
the rest of his life; this trend eventually led to his death.

Obviously Presendia was supportive of the prophet and must have shared
some level of attraction to make the trip to visit him personally
without her husband Norman Buell in tow. Maybe she was somebody who has
an affinity for people in Jo’s position, regardless of the fact that his
position had landed him in jail at that moment.

By the end of March, Jo was feeling the pinch and isolation. He wrote 3
epistles complaining to god about getting shafted constantly since they
moved to Missouri. Those epistles later were canonized into sections
121, 2, and 3 of the D\&C, and here’s a quick snippet from 121 to give
you a sense of the tone of all three revelations.

> “**1 **O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth
> thy hiding place?
> 
> **2 **How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure
> eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of
> thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?
> 
> **3 **Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and
> unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward
> them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?”

Finally, jail temporarily broke Jo’s typically sanguine spirit. His
usual attitude of party first, ask questions never had been abandoned in
lieu of harsh inquisition of his personal God; why had god forsaken his
prophet? Jo had been the chosen one for so long, why now was the lord
causing his wrath to fall upon the prophet?

You know, it’s kind of hard to talk about Liberty jail to believers
because it’s complicated enough to be misconstrued into all kinds of
incredible evidences for Jo’s personal god. Let me pose a hypothetical
conversation to you.

This is what happens when you create a no-lose proposition and
non-falsifiable model for history, we can’t talk as equals, there’s
always room for God to squeak into the historical equation, whereas I
would make the claim that it was all a given set of circumstances that
quickly snowballed and rightfully landed Jo in prison, from which he
eventually escaped and never paid his debt to society.

Everything we’ve talked about so far has been focused on Jo and his
experience inside the prison. So much has been going on outside those
walls, but Jo didn’t know about any of it because we just read nearly
everything he received with intel about the Mormon’s removal from
Missouri to Illinois.

Last historical episode followed the journey of Sidney Rigdon through
his stay in the Liberty Jail and his subsequent escape after his epic
oration delivered pro se in court. Well, let’s pick up outside the walls
of Liberty Jail. We’ll cover Jo and Friends’ escape next historical
episode. I thought we would get there today, but it just blew up way too
big reading so much from the letter exchanges.

In order to understand what Jo and friends did as soon as they escaped
the law, we need to cover what happened during February and March of
1839 in Illinois under Rigdon and Bloody Brigham’s direction.

When the Saints began settling in Missouri in 1838 in large enough
numbers to influence elections, politicians and businessmen began
catering to the needs and political desires of the Saints to secure
their voting bloc. The same phenomenon emerged upon their arrival to
Illinois, it just so happens that Illinois citizens were largely more
receptive than many Missouri citizens had been. To be fair, Illinois
didn’t have the earlier scrape from back in 1832-3 in Jackson County to
taint public perception of the Mormons, they were starting with
essentially a clean slate in Quincy and the surrounding 50-mile radius.

The saints were critically vulnerable as refugees, which opened them up
to considering proposals they otherwise may have never previously
considered. It had essentially been agreed upon in Liberty Jail that
Illinois would be the next settlement location for the saints, now it
was a matter of making that dream and necessity a reality, to which
Rigdon fervently devoted every waking moment. Here enters Isaac Galland,
a war veteran and wealthy property owner around the Mississippi in Iowa
and Illinois.

Galland had a wide and varied career throughout his days including:
being a colonel in the Black Hawk War, a multiply failed politician
who’d run unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2 different states, a
medical doctor, published author, and most importantly a
land-speculator. We’re interested in him for that last career-path
choice he made. Galland owned a TON of property, or at least he held the
deeds to a TON of property. He owned the deed to 1,000 acres in the
“military tract” on the western border of Illinois and apparently
owned a deed for 19,000 acres in the half-breed tract on the other side
of the Mississippi in Iowa territory. These land “tracts” were set out
by the U.S. government for various purposes, the military tract being
reserved for government military combatants who were paid in acreage
instead of money, and the half-breed tract, which was reserved for white
settlers who were taking Native Americans as wives and having
“half-breed children”.

The thing about land speculation back then is it was the wild western
frontier. If you purchased land from somebody, 6 other people might
emerge with deeds showing the land was theirs and ask why you gave that
guy money for their land. Even more than that, people could just write
their own land-deed as new areas were carved out by the U.S. government
and simply claim some segment of the land grab was their land, the lack
of legitimate oversight back then was appalling. Well, Isaac Galland had
been present for many of these land-grabs since the Indian Removal act
had been in full effect. The roughly 1,000 acres of property he owned in
the military tract of Illinois was legitimately his, paid to him for his
military service. The 19,000 acres on the other side, sparing you some
arduous details, wasn’t actually his, he just had some random deed which
claimed that he owned the property.

In order to understand Galland’s backstory a little better I’ll include
a link in the show notes to 24-page super-easy read about Galland from
byustudies.edu titled, “Isaac Galland—Mormon Benefactor”. There’s kind
of a lot to unpack with this guy and he has an interesting story
including some practice of polygamy before it was ever cool for the
Mormons. I would recommend reading up on this guy to understand a bit
more of his role in the land acquisition process during 1839.

Suffice it to say, once Rigdon had settled with the refugee Saints in
the makeshift Quincy, Illinois, people like Isaac Galland began to
emerge from the woodwork and benefit from the Mormons’ suffering. He had
been living in a two-story home built barely a decade prior just south
of the little swampland of Commerce, Illinois. He didn’t have any
neighbors and the nearest large town was more than a week’s ride away.
This proved to be the optimal settlement location for the Saints and was
only a 3-4-day walk from Quincy where all the Saints were temporarily
camped out.

After a failed attempt, Rigdon was able to make contact with Galland to
tour the tract of land and discuss possible purchase terms. Rigdon
seriously considered purchasing the land owned by Galland, but wasn’t
sure it was a good idea, as he’d had bad experiences with land
speculators in the past. There was also the problem of the ability to
pay for any land Galland sold the Mormons. The Mormons were by-in-large
quite destitute, as most refugees usually are. Even if Galland were
providing the best price of any other land speculator out there, it
didn’t matter if the Mormons couldn’t pay for the land or didn’t have
the credit to begin settlement on loan.

A solution existed, but the ramifications are a bit questionable. The
Mormons owned tons of land in Missouri, including the long-held plots in
actual Zion, Independence. They had been holding on to these parcels of
land in Zion since they began purchasing them in 1831. This land in Zion
coupled with the land they’d been purchasing all the years since they
declared Independence as Zion tallied up to a hefty grand total of
holdings in Missouri, even if some of the deeds were held in dispute for
lack of payment. But that’s hallowed ground\! Some cried. You can’t just
sell Zion, that’s where the Lord will return at the millennium\! Those
arguments didn’t seem to matter when there were literally thousands of
people without homes or food in February and March in Illinois. I’ll
tell you, this last January I was in Chicago. Never again. That state
simply isn’t for humans during winter months, much less humans who don’t
have actual structures and homes in which to live. Decisions needed to
be made in order to save the starving Mormons, and Hingepin Rigdon did
his best to make them. Something about Galland struck Rigdon the wrong
way and he decided to appeal the decision to Jo.

Initially, Rigdon merely leased a small farm with his son-in-law, George
W. Robinson, and leader of the Danites, Elias Higbee, about 40 miles
north of Quincy, about 10 miles south of Commerce. That’s the farm
Galland owned but leased to Rigdon temporarily. Rigdon didn’t trust
Galland, and thought engaging in business with him may lead the church
into some form of peril they hadn’t yet experienced.

Regardless of his apprehensions, Rigdon met with Isaac Galland around
March 11<sup>th</sup> and expressed interest in purchasing everything
Galland had which amounted to about 1,000 acres in and around Commerce
for $18,000 and an additional “about twenty thousand acres,” of the
half-breed tract in Iowa, contracted for an additional $50,000 to be
paid over 20 years of installments. As soon as Galland saw the Mormons
coming, he talked to his friends in the Iowa and Illinois legislative
and judicial branches. This is a quote from the article on
byustudies.edu which introduces a few characters into the mix.

With the contacts Isaac Galland had with higher-ups in the Iowa and
Illinois government, he was a powerful ally to have on the Mormon’s
side. Jo recognized the importance of courting Galland. I’ll tell you,
I’ve been looking into this guy for a while trying to figure him out
and I’m not terribly sure what to make of him. We’ll keep him in our
timeline’s focus as we progress, just know he is seen as a polarizing
figure in Mormon history, which seems unfounded to me. Regardless of who
Galland really was or what his intentions may have been, Jo trusted him
and wrote this to Bishop Edward Party-Boy Partridge concerning Galland,
dated 22 March 1839.

Jo was definitely on board with Isaac Galland, let’s hope that doesn’t
come back to burn him at any point. Galland would eventually join the
church even though the actual ownership of the Iowa deeds he sold the
church came in to question. Galland is seen as an opportunist or
swindler by some and a good honest guy who was swindled out of land
deeds himself which he unwittingly sold to the church by others. Like I
said, it’s kinda hard to nail this guy down.

Party-boy Partridge showed the letter from Jo to Rigdon and Rigdon knew
it was time to start serious talks with Galland in order to secure the
lands he had for sale. He began those serious talks just as Jo, Hyrum,
and friends were amidst planning their escape. He was dedicated to
helping the saints and doing everything necessary to secure a place for
them to live. Remember, a number of those Mormons had been Rigdonites
long before Jo ever made his way on to the scene. Rigdon was just taking
care of his faithful followers as they were looking towards the white
chin-strap bearded shepherd to answer their turmoil and personal woes.

That’s something admirable to consider; once Rigdon got to Illinois, he
wasted absolutely zero time in dealing with the refugee crisis on his
hands. He was the only member of the leadership not actively in jail at
the time and therefore acted as supreme leader of the church on behalf
of the saints.

But let’s just talk on him for another minute here. Rigdon had
previously stated that Christ’s sufferings were a fool to his, claiming
that he suffered more than a Jew who was executed for heresy. Seeing
that Rigdon was still alive after his 2.5-month incarceration, he may
have been blowing things a bit out of proportion. But it remains that
Rigdon was in the real world dealing with real-world shit. He was a
faithful man for decades of his life, never having his faith truly put
to trial like this before, and understandably, Rigdon had some
conflicting thoughts about his situation. This was reported by John
Taylor, third prophet of the church and it’s recorded in the JoD vol 23,
page 12, delivered on Nov. 9<sup>th</sup>, 1881.

Rigdon seemingly had some challenging personal questions with which he
had to wrestle. He’d spent his entire life serving God as a full-time
minister, trying his utmost to understand whatever it is out there that
fits into those three letters, “God”. And once again, we end an
historical episode on Sidney Rigdon. Let’s have that same conversation
with an hypothetical Rigdon that we had with a believer earlier.

These are hypothetical conversations so I can make them do anything I
want, but I’m trying to get to a point. When Jo wrote section 121 of the
D\&C, which we read the beginning of, he basically wrote, god, why have
you forsaken us? Where are you? Rigdon, on the other hand, knew that
only a pernicious or disconnected god would allow his faithful people to
suffer through so much turmoil and still continue to turn a blind eye.
Rigdon had been contemplating the nature of God his entire life, and he
came to the resolute conclusion that whatever god out there which caused
all this shit to happen, isn’t a god that’s worth serving. You have to
commend him in that regard. At least he actively contemplates God,
instead of just preaching about him.

This may have actually served to be a wedge between Jo and Rigdon. Jo
was continually content to believe in his god, and just realized that
his god had forsaken him while in that dungeon. But once Jo was busted
out and was mayor of Nauvoo and head of his own army and town of 15,000
people a mere 2 years after this, life was alright and god was on his
side. Rigdon continued to struggle with his own personal God for years
to come, which likely contributes to the common modern perception
Mormons have of Rigdon being a faithless pansy who left Brigham when the
church needed him the most.

Once again, we end with a segment about how much of an ass Jo was and
how awesome Rigdon was. If you read this part of Mormon history from
Fawn Brodie in *No Man Knows My History,* you find a starkly different
interpretation of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, which only further
exhibits the failing historians have in trying to paint a picture of
these incredibly complicated individuals. I like Rigdon, he’s kinda my
hero. I think Fawn Brodie may have had a crush on Jo, even though she
didn’t like how much he slept around with other women under the guise of
righteous polygamy. Granted, I haven’t read the entire book yet, only
considerable chunks, so my opinion of Brodie’s opinion could be
completely inaccurate. But it gets to a central point in historical
studies.

When I was in Utah hanging out with Joey and Andrew of the Pulpit
Podcast, we got into some interesting discussions about Mormon history
and the historical Joseph Smith. One of those conversations we even
recorded for an episode of their podcast, check the show notes for a
link to it. But we came to a realization that Joey and Andrew see a
different Jo, Rigdon, Ollie, Hyrum, Party-Boy Partridge, and Bloody
Brigham than I do. We can each use our sources and personal logic to
back up the version of each of those people; we can each explain why we
see a specific version of each person, but we can only assert those
versions to the point where we have historical documentation backing us
up. The real Rigdon and Jo were vastly different than any logical
construct we try and put them into for the purposes of understanding
Mormon history.

I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again. Skepticize Mormon history.
Construct your own models of these people based on whatever sources you
feel are logically defensible, and when somebody poses information which
challenges the narrative you’ve created for some of these people, it’s
important for your models to be malleable enough to adapt to that new
information. That’s how we approach history with a scientific mind;
tentative conclusions based on documentable evidence, continuously
vulnerable to falsifiability and adaptation. That’s how we science
history.
