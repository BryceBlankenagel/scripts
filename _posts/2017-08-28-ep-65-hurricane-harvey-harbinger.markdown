Ep 65 – Hurricane Harvey Harbinger

On this episode, we do something we’ve never done before; cover a news
story as it’s breaking. Hurricane Harvey has already wreaked billions of
dollars in devastation on Texas and one concerned parent wants to reach
his missionary son. Unfortunately, the rule book doesn’t allow for this
so the Mission President cut off all attempts of John O’Conner to reach
his missionary son. This story is currently developing and we’ll bring
updates as we learn more.
