Ep 71 – Worst POTUS EVER with Cognitive Dissonance

On this episode, we invite on Tom and Cecil of the Cognitive Dissonance
podcast to talk about the worst presidential candidate in American
History, Joseph Smith. From New York to Illinois, everything Jo touched
fell into a state of chaos and ruin. By the time we get to his 1844
presidential campaign, he’s won and lost dozens of business ventures,
built and dissolved a handful of newspapers, and fully established his
Mormon theocracy on the Mississippi. Join us for all the shenanigans and
don’t forget to check out Tom and Cecil’s podcasts, Cognitive Dissonance
and, for all the history fans out there, Citation Needed on all your
favorite podcast vehicles.
