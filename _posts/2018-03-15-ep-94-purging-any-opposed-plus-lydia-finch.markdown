Ep 94 – Purging Any Opposed Plus Lydia Finch

On this episode, we dive into our historical timeline by examining the
power of the press in early Mormonism. From the BoM to the Times and
Seasons, the Mormons were publication fiends in absolute control of the
information going out of Nauvoo through public literature. Ebenezer
Robinson, Thomas B. Marsh, and Don Carlos Smith work as editors for the
Times and Seasons which goes off without a hitch until August 1841.
Polygamy starts to be taught to various members of trusted Mormon elite
without Common Consent of the average chapel-attending Mormon. After
that, we have on Lydia Finch to discuss cults, how to identify them, and
what mechanisms they use to exert control over their members. Stick
around after the interview to hear about the upcoming Protect LDS
Children march at the end of this month.

Hangout after campaign

Full campaign details

We’re jumping back into our historical timeline today\!

Since its inception, Joseph’s Mormonite sect had some kind of propaganda
machine turning out publications on behalf of the Church at stunning
volume. It all began in 1830 with the seminal Mormon publication, the
Book of Mormon. What followed it was a string of newspaper publications
and editions of the Mormon revelations known as the Book of
Commandments, which became the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835.

The first periodical newspaper the early Church published was under the
name of The Evening and the Morning Star. This newspaper debuted in 1832
from the Independence, Missouri printing press, with editor in Chief,
William Wines, Double-Dub Phelps overseeing every word printed. Once the
Book of Commandments was being printed including passages like this from
the modern D\&C 42: “32 For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by
the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled; for I will consecrate the
riches of the Gentiles, unto my people which are of the house of
Israel.”

This command by Joseph speaking for God basically said that the property
of the Gentiles will be appropriated to the Mormons. This revelation
making its way around Missouri while the Mormons were settling and
building their kingdom in Independence, their designated Zion, caused
enough public outcry, resulting in the Mormon’s expulsion from Jackson
County and the burning of the Independence printing press. The Evening
and the Morning Star ceased publication for want of a printing office
which wasn’t legitimately on fire.

As the Mormons in Missouri were resettling in the counties north of
Jackson County, the Mormon HQ in Kirtland, Ohio began printing the
Latter Day Saints’ Messenger and Advocate, a monthly publication which
ran until suffering financial problems with the fallout of the KSS
company and the Panic of 1837. Many of the revelations including from
modern-day section 64-110 were published in the Messenger and Advocate
along with other church-related topics and even some of Eliza Snow’s
poems. When the Messenger and Advocate collapsed under Oliver Cowdery’s
watch, Don Carlos Smith, youngest brother of the Prophet, started up the
Elders’ Journal in Kirtland. This monthly journal ran two publications
prior to the Mormon exodus from Ohio to Missouri, where it published 2
more issues from Far West, Missouri, prior to the Mormons’ exodus from
Missouri to Illinois.

During the ensuing chaos of the fallout from the Missouri Mormon war,
the press and typeset were buried underground in Far West to keep it
from falling into Gentile hands. Once the Mormons had begun their
settlement in Commerce, Illinois and were reasonably certain they could
put down semi-permanent roots in that state, Elias Smith and Hiram Clark
went back to Far West and unearthed the press and typeset in April 1839,
when they transported the unit to what would soon become Nauvoo.

Ebenezer Robinson, an ambitious young man of 25, was given control of
the printing press as primary editor, with Don Carlos Smith being
appointed by the prophet as assistant editor. Robinson and Don Carlos
began their work of establishing the press in the cellar of a small
shack right on the banks of the Mississippi throughout June to Aug 1839
where the working conditions were utterly terrible. Seepage from the
walls due to the high water table during the sweltering humid conditions
of the Illinois summer cultivated spores of mold and mildew on nearly
every surface. Even getting the printed paper to dry with the lack of
air flow presented its own challenges. Concluding the conditions were
too unfavorable to continue the work of printing, Don Carlos Smith and
Ebenezer Robinson petitioned to have a printing establishment built on
the northeast corner of Water and Bain streets in Nauvoo, which was
granted by the High Council.

A haphazardly constructed makeshift frame building was constructed in
late August and early September of 1839, to which the press and
accompanying equipment were moved. Finally in November of 1839, the
first publication of the first volume of the Times and Seasons was
churned out of the press and widely circulated to the settling saints in
Illinois and Iowa. Letters from the Prophet updating the Saints on his
meeting with President Martin Van Buren and other chapters of U.S.
government were some of the first articles published in the Times &
Seasons in December, January, and February 1839 and ’40.

The Times and Seasons continued to be published once to twice per month
throughout 1840 and ’41 under the direction of Ebenezer Robinson and Don
Carlos Smith. Across the pond in Europe, the Latter-day Saints’
Millennial Star was established in 1840 while the Q12 were on their
mission trip which would continue to be published until 1970. Throughout
the rest of the 1840s, these are the names of other LDS publications
which would be published for varying time spans: The Gospel Reflector,
The Wasp, Nauvoo Neighbor, Gospel Light, The Prophet, The New-York
Messenger, and People’s Organ. The Mormons’ bandwidth for turning out
propaganda was steadily increasing to match the plethora of gentile
publications who wrote stories about the Mormons in less-than-favorable
light.

The Times and Seasons was a powerful propaganda and history outlet for
the Church. It was also the most widely consumed publication of the
church by those unfamiliar or unfriendly to the Mormons. The Gentiles
outside Nauvoo would come to know Joseph Smith and the Mormons through
what Ebenezer Robinson and Don Carlos Smith published. The original
systemic History of the Church would be published in 1842 through the
Times & Seasons, there’s no possible way to overstate the power of this
publishing arm of the Church.

One person Ebenezer Robinson and Don Carlos Smith worked closely with
was one Robert B. Thompson, who was Jo’s personal secretary and
recorder/historian. Robert B. Thompson, as an associate newspaper
editor, was working with Jo on the comprehensive History of the Church
to be published in the Times & Seasons by Ebenezer Robinson and Don
Carlos. More than just Jo’s personal secretary and recorder, Thompson
was also a very close friend of the prophet, even meriting his own verse
in the most important revelation in Nauvoo, included as D\&C 124 today
where it says this:

“12. And again, verily I say unto you, Let my servant Robert B. Thompson
help you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and
that he should be with you ; 13. Let him, therefore, hearken to your
counsel, and I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings; let him
be faithful and true in all things from henceforth, and he shall be
great in mine eyes ; 14. But let him remember that his stewardship will
I require at his hands.”

All these men were closely held acolytes among the printing business in
Nauvoo. Not only did they know what was going on behind the scenes, they
filtered reality through their printing press to determine how the
outside world and the average Mormon populous would view the religion
and Nauvoo with the Times & Seasons.

1841 was busy as ever for Jo and the elite of the church. Jo had just
taken Louisa Beaman as his first sealed polygamist wife in Nauvoo and
was actively courting the pregnant newlywed Zina Diantha Huntington
Jacobs. Rumors of polygamy had plagued the Church from its earliest
days. In fact, the 1835 Doctrine and Covenants included this passage in
Section 101:4

"Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of
fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should
have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of
death, when either is at liberty to marry again."

Rumors of polygamy wouldn’t die because it was being actively practiced
behind closed doors by the prophet for nearly a decade by 1841. The
reception of the doctrine of polygamy among Jo’s most trusted elites was
definitely mixed.

In an 1845 letter Hingepin Sidney Rigdon wrote, he offers a window into
his appalled perspective of how the veneer of priesthood was being used
to cajole women into consenting to polygamous marriages. Speaking of
Nancy Marinda Hyde’s marital affiliation with Dr. Willard Richards and
the prophet whilst Orson Hyde was on a mission, Rigdon said this, taken
from 294 of Van Wagoner’s Sidney Rigdon, a Portrait of Religious Excess:

“If R\[ichards\] should take a notion to H\[yde\]’s wife in his absence,
all that is necessary to be done is to be sealed. No harm done, no
adultery committed; only taking a little advantage of rights of
priesthood. And after R\[ichards\] has gone the round of dissipation
with H\[yde\]’s wife, she is afterwards turned over to S\[mith\] and
thus the poor silly woman becomes the actual dupe to two designing men,
under the sanctimonious garb of rights of the royal priesthood.”

It's understandable that Hingepin Rigdon was a bit burned by Jo and the
Church when he wrote this, especially considering it was written after
the majority of the Church had sided with either Bloody Brigham or James
Strang. Rigdon had been dealing with the fallout from Jo’s free-love for
a decade and a half when this was written and he’d successfully burned
most bridges through his absentee nature through much of Nauvoo history.
Rigdon’s own daughter, Nancy Rigdon, had even been propositioned by Jo
to be sealed, an action which catalyzed much conflict between these two
old friends and business partners.

Brigham Young said when he first learned of the doctrine of polygamy,
“It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave.” Widely
interpreted to mean he was so depressed at learning of the doctrine, I
think we can judge from his actions of taking 55 wives during his years
that maybe he was looking forward to the eternal polygamy fest that is
the Mormon afterlife and desired it as soon as humanly possible. If
Bloody Brigham was a guy who liked having sex with dozens of women, an
afterlife comprised of nothing but that would understandably cause him
to desire the grave.

Polygamy was a polarizing issue. Logistically speaking alone, polygamy
is a doctrine which can’t be widely practiced with a 50/50 male to
female population split unless there’s widespread polyandry going on to
accompany the polygyny. We also can’t ignore the need to keep it secret.
Adultery laws may seem like a vestige of an older generation but there
are still states today with adultery laws on the books. In the
19<sup>th</sup>-century, it was almost an exclusive majority of states
with adultery laws on the books or in state constitutions. The ongoing
rumors of polygamy posed not only a moral issue for the prophet of the
church, but also a legal challenge.

Even Hyrum Smith had to be convinced polygamy was commanded of gods once
the deafening roar of the rumors became too much to be mere anti-Mormon
speculation. Brigham Young recalled a conversation he had with Hyrum
Side-kick Abiff Smith in 1842 or 43 while Hyrum was supposedly ignorant
of the practice. I’m reading this from dialogue on Mormon thought titled
Identifying the Earliest Mormon Polygamists by Gary James Bergera. It’s
a really fascinating read, you can find it in the show notes.

“Right north of the Masonic Hall in Nauvoo the ground was not fenced,
this was in the year 1842 \[sic, 1843\]. There were some rails laid
along to fence up some lots. Hyrum \[Smith\] saw me and said, "brother
Brigham, I want to talk to you." We went together and sat upon those
rails that were piled up. He commenced by saying, "I have a question to
ask you. In the first place I say unto you, that I do know that you and
the twelve know some things that I do not know. I can understand this by
the motions, and talk, and doings of Joseph, and I know there is
something or other, which I do not understand, that is revealed to the
Twelve. Is this so"? I replied "I do not know any thing about what you
know, but I know what I know.\["\] Then he said, "I have mistrusted for
a long time that Joseph has received a revelation that a man should have
more than one wife, and he has hinted as much to me, but I would not
bear it." . . . I will now go back to where I met Hyrum. He said to me,
"I am convinced that there is something that has not been told me. I
said to him, "brother Hyrum, Joseph would tell you everything the Lord
reveals to him, if he could." I must confess I felt a little sarcastic
towards Hyrum, although he was just as honest as an Angel, and as full
of integrety as the Gods' but he had not that ability which Joseph
possessed to see and understand men as they were. I took advantage of
this, and I said to him, "Brother Hyrum, I will tell you about this
thing which you say you do not know about if you will sware with an
uplifted hand, before God, that you will never say another word against
Joseph and his doings, and the doctrines he is preaching to the people."
He replied, "I will do it with all my heart; I want to be saved" and he
stood upon his feet, saying, "I want to be knowing the truth and to be
saved." And he made a covenant there, never again to bring forward one
argument or use any influence against Joseph's doings. Joseph had a
g\[ood\] many wives sealed to him. I told Hyrum the whole story, and he
bowed to it and wept like a child, and said God be praised. He went to
Joseph and told him what he had learned, and renewed his covenant with
Joseph, and they went heart and hand together while they lived, and they
were together when they died, and they are together now defending
Israel.71”

This is a story reported only by Bloody Brigham Young and it was
recounted in 1866, 22 years after the fact while Brigham was openly
practicing polygamy in his Utah theocracy. There’s a lot of vested
interests and possible false memories in this story and it could be
completely apocryphal, but what it illustrates is important. Polygamy
wasn’t something decreed over the pulpit in Nauvoo the way it was in
Utah in 1852, it was an aspect of Nauvoo history only existing within
the confines of the underbelly of Mormon society, and only practiced by
those who could unequivocally be trusted with such damning information.
Any malicious actor who came to learn of the practice of polygamy held a
toolbox of legal and religious blackmail leverage over the Prophet and
the Mormon elites. They had to be extremely careful to vet those
entrusted with the sacred knowledge to ensure they had the Prophet’s
best interests in mind.

Don Carlos Smith wasn’t as receptive to the doctrine of polygamy and the
rumors surrounding it. Don Carlos was a loved and respected Smith by
everybody. I’ve yet to find a single writing concerning him that shows
him in anything but a favorable light. To be fair though, in August of
1841, Don Carlos was a mere 25 years old, so he was only just beginning
his career. His fellow editor of the Times & Seasons, Ebenezer Robinson,
who spoke with Don Carlos every single day at the office, told his
recollection of Don Carlos learning the doctrine of polygamy. This
statement was made in 1890 while Ebenezer Robinson was serving as the
editor of the Whitmerite publication, ‘The Return’ and the Whitmerites
were notoriously opposed to polygamy in the face of their Josephite and
Brighamite counterparts. Ebenezer Robinson claimed Don Carlos Smith said
this of the doctrine of polygamy, which I’m reading from Agnes Moultin
Coolbrith’s biography page on JosephSmithsPolygamy.org:

“Any man who will teach and practice the doctrine of spiritual wifery
will go to hell, I don’t care if it is my brother Joseph.” Robinson
added: “He was a bitter opposer of the ‘spiritual wife’ doctrine.”

According to Don Carlos’ coworker and good friend, Ebenezer Robinson,
this happened in Summer of 1841 when the rumors of polygamy were
swirling. A quick addition, Don Carlos Smith’s wife, Agnes Moulton
Coolbrith, was known as one of the more attractive young women in
Nauvoo. She was attentive and charming and seemed to have others’
interest in mind in spite of any difficulties she may have been
suffering, her warmness always shone through.

As wife of Don Carlos, Agnes wrote to her brothers-in-law during their
stay in Liberty Jail in 1839. I’m reading this from pg 151 of Todd
Compton’s book, In Sacred Loneliness:

“Beloved Brothers, Hyrum and Joseph: By the permit of my companion, I
write a line to show that I have not forgotten you; neither do I forget
you; for my prayer is to my Heavenly Father for your deliverance. It
seems as though the Lord is slow to hear the prayers of the Saints. But
the Lord’s ways are not like our ways; therefore He can do better than
we ourselves. You must be comforted, Brothers Hyrum and Joseph, and look
forward for better days. Your little ones are as playful as little
lambs; be comforted concerning them, for they are not cast down and
sorrowful as we are; their sorrows are only momentary but ours
continual. May the Lord bless, protect, and deliver you from all your
enemies and restore you to the bosom of your families, is the prayer of
AGNES M. SMITH”

Agnes was truly an amazing woman. She ended up raising one of the most
prominent poets of early 20<sup>th</sup> century California, Ina
Coolbrith. That letter is one of the very few extant writings from
Agnes’ own pen, but the prominence of her daughter garnered attention
and much of what we know of Agnes’ life comes from her daughter. Don
Carlos and Agnes were married in July of 1835 in Kirtland after the
Coolbrith family had converted and moved there in 1832.

With the organization of the Nauvoo Legion, Don Carlos Smith had been
placed in the office of Brig. General of the Nauvoo Legion at his ripe
age of 25. Don Carlos had a powerful career ahead of him as a trusted
brother of the Prophet. If only he wasn’t opposed to his elder brother’s
newfound doctrine of polygamy. Robert B. Thompson left behind no
writings or second-hand quotes concerning his opinions on polygamy, but
if he was such close friends with Ebenezer Robinson and Don Carlos
Smith, he may have shared their similar opinions that polygamy was an
abomination at this time in the church. Opponents must be dealt with
properly.

In August of 1841, tragedy struck on multiple fronts. From the HoC Dan
Vogel edition 4:389

“August 7—My younger brother Don Carlos Smith died at his residence in
Nauvoo this morning… in the 25<sup>th</sup> year of his age.

He was born 25<sup>th</sup> March 1816, was one of the first to receive
my testimony, and was ordained to the Priesthood when only 14 years of
age. The evening after the plates of the Book of Mormon were shown to
the eight witnesses, a meeting was held, when all the witnesses, as also
Don Carlos bore testimony to the truth of the latter-day dispensation.
He accompanied father to visit grandfather and relatives in St. Lawrence
County, New York, in August, 1830…. He was one of the 24 Elders who laid
the cornerstones of the Kirtland Temple…”

And it continues to tell Don Carlos Smith’s story after that.

Then, a mere 8 days later, Joseph’s one-year-old son carrying the same
name of Don Carlos Smith, died of an unknown illness. This was the
4<sup>th</sup> child born to Joseph and Emma who died before they
reached 2 years old. To lose a 1-year-old son a week after a brother, we
can’t even imagine what this must have been like.

Then, from 407 of vol 4 of the Vogel HoC:

“Friday, 27 \[Aug\]—Elder Robert Blashel Thompson died at his residence
in Nauvoo, in the 30<sup>th</sup> year of his age, in the full hope of a
glorious resurrection. He was associate editor of the Times and Seasons,
colonel in the Nauvoo Legion, and had done much writing for myself and
the Church.”

After which it gives a brief biography of Thompson written by his widow,
which concludes with this paragraph:

“When the Nauvoo Legion was formed, he received the office of colonel,
and also aid-de-camp. In May, 1841, he became associated with Don
C\[arlos\] Smith in the editing of the Times and Seasons. On the
16<sup>th</sup> of August he was seized with the same disease, of which
Don C. had died on the 7<sup>th</sup>. The attachment between them was
so strong, it seemed as though they could not long be separated. He died
on the 27<sup>th</sup>, leaving one child; was interred in the burying
ground on the 29<sup>th</sup>. By his special request no military
procession was formed at his funeral.”

That last line is important from Robert B. Thompson’s eulogy, because
they did bring out the whole Nauvoo Legion in full uniform force for the
funeral procession of Don Carlos. These men were loved O.G.s of
Mormonism and Don Carlos was a member of the aristocracy of Nauvoo, his
presence was sincerely missed.

Now to help tell the somber and harrowing story of Don Carlos Smith’s
funeral, please permit me a reading of Eliza Snow’s poem about the
funeral which seems to aptly capture the collective Mormon psyche during
the procession.

86 The Funeral of Brig. General Smith

It was a Sabbath day.—The morning came,  
But came not with the usual joyousness  
With which the consecrated day was wont,  
In Nauvoo City, ever and anon,  
To usher its broad radiance on a train 5  
Of humble, cheerful worshipers. Nature  
Seem’d conscious of the mournful knell  
That broke upon the sadden’d heart of man\!  
The sun arose, muffled with clouds that hid  
His own bright beams, and in effusions soft 10  
And gentle, as the soothing feeling tones  
Of sorrow, dropt a sympathetic tear.  
At length the clouds dispers’d—the sun pour’d forth  
His glorious rays in brilliant majesty;  
And I beheld upon the beauteous plain 15  
That fronts the noble Mississippi’s wave,  
A mighty host—a pow’rful warrior band  
Whose rich escutcheons glitter’d in the sun.

I heard the sound of martial music, but  
It came with solemn, slow and mournful air, 20  
Unlike the bold, and thrilling notes that call  
The restless warrior to the battle field\!  
There was no clash of arms—no din of war—  
The sword was sheath’d, and every martial brow  
Was mellow’d into sadness\! Mounted high 25  
Upon a fiery steed, a Chieftain sat  
And issued the command; and then, anon,  
In double file—in open columns form’d,  
With Chieftains in the front—then horse and foot,  
In solemn order, mov’d across the wide 30  
Extended plain, the Nauvoo Legion. ’Twas  
A splendid sight—a sight that would have charm’d  
The eye of each beholder: but alas\!  
That grand display, was the last honors paid  
To the departed\!  
In the Legion’s rear, 35  
Still length’ning out the vast procession; walk’d  
A crowd of citizens of every rank—  
Of either sex; and last of all clos’d in  
A long and glitt’ring train of carriages.

I gaz’d upon the grand procession, till 40  
It disappear’d amid the dwellings which  
Stand thickly cluster’d near the river’s edge  
I listen’d—all was still—the music notes  
No longer sounded on the pensive breeze,  
But hark\! the notes awaken’d, and I saw 45  
The mighty host returning with the same,  
Slow, melancholy tread\! A hearse was borne  
Along with solemn, yet bold martial pomp,  
That plainly signified, a mighty one,  
One of no ordinary rank, had fallen\! 50

Near to the summit of an eminence  
Rising in bold relief, to dignify,  
The beauty of the verdant plain beneath;  
In Nature’s temple, with no other wall,  
Than the horizon; and no other arch, 55  
Than the broad canopy of heaven; shaded  
With clust’ring boughs, whose foliage waves around;  
Is rais’d an altar to the living God.  
There the procession march’d—it halted there;  
And in the front of weeping relatives, 60  
The hearse of him was placed, who there, in life  
Had been a fervent, constant worshipper\!

His arms and armor, on his coffin lay  
And other swords than his, lay crossing there.  
His brother officers, who form’d with him, 65  
The noblest Military Staff, our fair  
Columbia has to boast, were seated by  
In shining armor clad; but ah\! they seem’d  
Divested of the martial haughtiness—  
That warlike pride that fires the warrior’s eye— 70  
It lay conceal’d beneath the brow of grief.

The invocation and the sacred chant,  
Open’d the solemn service of the day;  
And then the man of God arose. In tones  
Of truth’s impassion’d eloquence, he spoke 75  
Of the late sad occurrence, which had touch’d  
The hearts of all; and universally  
Was calling forth, a “fellowship of grief.”  
Each soldier, mourn’d a general—each saint,  
A brother—and each citizen, a friend\! 80

But when he came to paint the glories of  
The world to come; wrapt in the visions of  
Eternal truth; e’en grief itself, bow’d down,  
And the vast multitude, for once, forgot  
To weep. And then, he sweetly dwelt upon 85  
The character of the deceas’d, without  
A stain—his christian life, that seem’d without  
A blemish—and his military course,  
A path of honor. Tho’ he had not stood  
Before the cannon’s mouth—altho’ he ne’er 90  
Had been in battle’s front amid the rage  
Of war, and clash of arms; and altho’ now,  
He’d fall’n according to the common course  
Of Providence, and had not perish’d by  
The sword; he was no less a patriot— 95  
He lov’d his country—he’d prepar’d himself,  
By stepping high, in military rank,  
To do her service at her earliest call.  
And then the chaplain spoke of him, in the  
Retir’d relations of domestic life. 100  
There sat his aged, widow’d mother, whom  
He’d honor’d with most filial sanctity—  
To whom, he’d been a constant solace in  
Those scenes of persecution and distress.  
Which she had suffer’d for the gospel’s sake. 105  
While, as a brother, he had ever prov’d,  
Firm as Gibraltar’s rock—true unto death.  
And then he come still nearer home, and touch’d  
The finest fibre of the human heart;  
And spoke of her, the lonely widow, of 110  
The noble fallen chieftain—the bereft  
Companion of his bosom, whom he’d lov’d  
With faithful tenderness. Ah\! who can now,  
Enter the halo of her feelings—soothe her grief  
For him who only could reciprocate 115  
Her bosom’s sympathies? He too, had been  
A loving and indulgent father to  
Her lonely, weeping babes—left fatherless\!  
To soothe the bleeding heart, the speaker then  
Spoke of the blest reunion, that awaits 120  
The faithful worshippers of the Most High.

Thus clos’d the man of God.—The service done;  
Again the great procession form’d, and once  
Again, the bearers took the silent pall  
And bore it onward to the “narrow house\!” 125

Then came the parting scenery that clos’d  
The service of the living to the dead.

Whether the olive branch—the cypress bough  
Or myrtle wreath, it matters not, ’twas given  
As the last token of profound respect— 130  
Emblem of friendship—of eternal life:  
The Legion, one by one, deposited  
Within the grave, a green unwither’d bough,  
And passing onward left the trophied urn\!  
A voice was heard slowly pronouncing, “Earth 135  
To earth—Ashes to ashes—Dust to dust,  
Return this body to its mother earth;”  
While on the coffin, fell the parted clod.  
Beside the grave, the Legion’s playing band,  
Awoke Melodia’s sweetest strain. A chord 140  
Was touch’d that echoed music to the springs  
Of life, and fell as soft upon the ear,  
As if seraphic harpers had come down  
To charm the sleeper in his lowly rest.

The music ceas’d—Another chaplain’s voice 145  
With heavenly eloquence pour’d forth in pray’r  
To the Eternal God, responding pass’d  
From heart to heart of the vast multitude—  
The mourning concourse in the burial grove.  
And there, beneath Time’s monument the oak; 150  
Whose umbrage wav’d luxurious to the breeze,  
They left the shrouded buried corpse of one,  
Belov’d in life and honor’d in his death;  
Waiting the trump of God, to call it forth  
To hail its own bright spirit from the skies\!

Hundreds of Mormon refugees died as a result of being driven from the
comfort of their homes and forced to settle an untamed swampland on the
Mississippi. The ague, as they called it, along with rickets, malaria,
cholera, and a number of equally terrible diseases plagued the Nauvoo
settlement. Robert B. Thompson and Don Carlos Smith worked in the
basement of that shack in printing the Times and Seasons which had all
sorts of terrible fungi and bacteria growing from the saturated walls
with absolutely no ventilation. These were merely two more casualties
among piles of dead Mormons who preceded Thompson and Smith in death.
But we can’t lose sight of what it must have been like for the Mormons
to lose a prominent and beloved member of the Smith family to illness
along with another extremely early Mormon who’d been a member of the
elite since the early Kirtland years.

All of that said, there is another interpretation or explanation for
these deaths which requires brief examination at very least.

From Andrew F. Smith’s biography of John C. Wreck-it Bennett titled “The
Saintly Scoundrel: The Life and Times of Dr. John Cook Bennett” from
page 80:

“Whatever happened, Bennett and Joseph Smith clearly had a temporary
parting of the ways. Bennett, who had been living with Joseph Smith’s
family, moved into other quarters. A few weeks later Don Carlos Smith
and Robert B. Thompson died after short illnesses. Their deaths have
been attributed to an epidemic then rampaging through Nauvoo; however,
Bennett was later reported to have said that Don Carlos Smith had been
murdered and that Joseph Smith “believed Bennett poisoned him.” No
evidence has surfaced to indicate that the cause of Don Carlos’s death
was anything other than natural.”

Yes, no evidence has surfaced to lead historians to believe that Don
Carlos and Robert B. Thompson were poisoned. The consensus explanation
of death by epidemic is plenty sufficient to explain their deaths.

But, let’s run on the latter assumption for a moment, what if they were
poisoned as Andrew Smith contests that Joseph believed in making the
accusation against Wreck-it Bennett? Why? Why would somebody want these
men dead?

Well, polygamy was kept deep under wraps in the church. Mormonism
operated under the law of Common Consent which is basically how the
Church was and currently is able to masquerade as a democratic
institution. Every 6 months when members vote to sustain the leadership,
they are invoking their right of Common Consent. Issues in the early
Church were resolved with healthy deliberation and debate and a
unanimous vote was usually reached after the elders argued a bit.
Doctrine, revelations, civil actions, everything was up for debate and
voted on by the elite in the Church and anything affecting the wider
populous was voted on in General Conferences. Jo knew that polygamy
would never pass as a public doctrine with unanimous Common Consent, so
he decided to practice it anyway and keep it under wraps.

Purely speculating here, so take that for what it’s worth, but Don
Carlos Smith was a vocal opponent of polygamy and if Robert B. Thompson
was also just as opposed, being such a close friend of Don Carlos, these
men had access to loads of information and people who would prove to
them beyond a shadow of a doubt that polygamy was being practiced behind
closed doors. Should Jo’s own brother and secretary go public with
information which proved the prophet was having affairs, imagine the
fallout. Would Joseph Smith poison his own brother to keep polygamy
under wraps? Doubtful…. Would Wreck-it Bennett poison two men to keep
polygamy secret? Who knows, many historians regard him as a truly
deplorable human being.

This whole issue is significantly complicated when we consider the fact
that a mere 5 months after this, Joseph married the widow of his late
brother, Agnes Coolbrith. Based on Levitical teachings of a wife being
passed to her husband’s brother upon her husband’s death, Jo was kind
enough to give Agnes an entire 3 months to mourn her husband’s death
before he began courting her. We shouldn’t use the fact that this
marriage fit into the Levitical commandments as the best way to explain
why Jo took Agnes as his wife. Agnes was simply beautiful. She was 8
years older than Don Carlos, yet only 3 years younger than Jo. Agnes had
shown affection toward both Jo and Hyrum with the letter she sent to
them in Liberty Jail. To claim that Jo married her simply out of
obligation to biblical polygamy would be ignoring his motivations for
every one of his marriages which weren’t Levitical.

To make this point relevant to today’s Church, Common Consent is still
part of the Church, it just so happens that opposition happens so rarely
that I doubt the leadership even has their own guidelines to deal with
people voting to oppose something. This upcoming march to Protect LDS
Children is a way to inform the leadership from the outside that people
want the Church to change in some way, but it doesn’t hold as much
influence as people voting in opposition when the call to sustain the
leadership inevitably happens the Sunday following the march.

The Church today isn’t the same Church Joseph Smith established or lead.
But some of the better aspects of his original Church still survive
today. If we want change to happen, marching isn’t enough. The next
action I can see having impact on the Church would be to resurrect the
anyopposed movement and get the Church to change its policy on these
bishops interviews. The Church isn’t going anywhere, it will continue
its parasitic relationship with reality and cause droves of children to
kill themselves for the shame they endure. It will continue to force
well-intentioned people of all ages and sexes to compartmentalize
reality apart from their beliefs. It will always have a hand in Utah
government. Short of outlawing the Church altogether, which I’m wholly
not in favor of, opposing the Church and its leadership from the inside
is the most effective way to drag it into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
Stick around after the interview to hear some important details
surrounding the march and what will be going on afterwards.

March Washington Square Park 451 State Street March 30<sup>th</sup> 2018

Have a table set up

If you’re planning on attending the march and want an evening activity,
John Dehlin will be hosting a potluck event at 9<sup>th</sup> south and
3<sup>rd</sup> east with karaoke beginning at 730. In case you didn’t
want to go to a karaoke night, friend of the show, Doug Hofeling, at
Squatter’s pub has been nice enough to reserve the third floor for us to
mingle and enjoy each other’s company. We’ll kick off our hangout at 7
p.m. It’s free admission with a cash bar, all ages welcome with
accompanying adult. At 8 o’clock I’ll be giving a presentation on the
history of bishop’s interviews and Common Consent which shouldn’t go too
long and then we’ll hang out as late as everyone wants to. So that’s
Squatter’s Pub at 147 West Broadway \[300 South\] on March
30<sup>th</sup> at 7 p.m., right after the Protect LDS Children march.
