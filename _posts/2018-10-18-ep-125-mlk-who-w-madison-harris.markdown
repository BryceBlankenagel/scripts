Ep 125 – MLK Who? w/ Madison Harris

On this episode, we take a break from the historical timeline to talk
with Madison Harris. She presented at the John Whitmer Historical
Conference 2018 and I snagged her for a quick interview on her
presentation. She discusses racism within the ranks of
20<sup>th</sup>-century Mormon leadership. The central focus surrounds
Utah and the Church’s opposition to the national holiday of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. Mormon racism didn’t end with the 1978 priesthood
ban being lifted.
