Ep 129 – Bennett Meltdown Pt. 6 Sarah Ann Whitney

On this episode, we begin with a letter Emma Smith wrote to Governor
Thomas Carlin reasoning and pleading for exoneration of her husband.
Then we get into the complicated and controversial nature of a letter
Joseph Smith wrote to his old friends, the Whitney family. We discuss
the polygamous marriage of Sarah Ann Whitney to Joseph Smith in July
1842 and how it provides context for the letter to the entire Whitney
family.

Jurassic Park

Shhhhh… Don’t make a sound. Were you followed? Did she see you?\! We
must be careful, they’re everywhere. Alright, let’s do this…

When last we checked in with Joseph Smith, he was sharing letter
correspondence with his new acting Major-General Wilson Law and Emma.
Nauvoo was Jo’s kingdom, but he couldn’t be seen in town lest he risk
arrest and extradition.

However, Jo didn’t just stay in one place. When he first went into
hiding, his uncle John Smith on the Iowa side of the river offered a
place of refuge, then it was off to his friend Sayers’ home where Jo
hunkered down for a few days. He spent these days writing as much as
conversing with Mormon elites showing up from time to time.

The heartfelt letter exchange between Emma and Jo was notable. When Emma
had gone to see Jo at Sayers’ farm, she had asked him if she should go
meet with Governor Carlin in Quincy. Jo took a few days to think about
it and sent the letter telling her that she could sent Carlin a letter,
but that meeting with him wasn’t a good idea.

This letter that Emma sent to Governor Carlin is quite remarkable. It
doesn’t paint Emma as a concerned wife simply pleading to the Governor
to forgive her husband’s sins and exonerate him. It reads as if she
wielded power in Nauvoo and was willing to reason with the Governor as
an equal, even if Carlin would never see her as an equal. Here’s the
letter to which I’m referring, dictated by Emma, written by her
secretary, Eliza R. Snow.

It is quite the letter. Emma was no silent partner of the prophet, she
was a contributing piece to the Mormon history puzzle. Even though her
husband had told her to not meet with Carlin, she penned this amazing
letter and sent it to Carlin by way of William Clayton as messenger.
Clayton presented the letter to Governor Carlin and Judge Ralston on the
19<sup>th</sup> of August 1842.

According to Jo’s journal, Carlin was impressed by the contents of the
letter. He’d never received a letter like this before from a prominent
woman pleading to exonerate her husband. Apparently though, he was quite
amazed. What Carlin told Clayton in this meeting is important, and we’ll
talk about why after reading the passage out of Joseph’s journal.

> The [Govr.](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#7369272238193915652) read

> expressed astonishment at the judgement and talent manifest in the
> manner of her address, He presented the letter to [Judge
> Ralston](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#10889927992783421254) requesting

> Carlin](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#13868050411477292608) then
> proceeded to reiterate the same language as on a former occasion viz.
> that he was satisfied there was no excitement any where but
> in [Nauvoo](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#15273044796751152857) “amongst

> in other places so far as he was able to ascertain.

That is interesting isn’t it. Carlin told William Clayton that the
excitement in the country and Jo’s fears of arrest and extradition were
only in the minds of the Mormons in Nauvoo, essentially telling them
that nobody else cares about what’s going on. Whether or not he said
that is important. Governor Carlin was in a tight spot. He had Governor
Reynolds on his back to extradite Jo and the rising of anti-Mormon
rhetoric all putting pressure on him to arrest Jo and turn him over.
However, this was right before mid-term elections, Carlin’s seat was up.
He had to treat the Mormons favorably or he’d never be reelected. But,
if he sided with the Mormons, he’d make enemies within the senate
chambers.

Beyond that, there were so-called anti-Mormons sending him letters every
day and knocking on his door for him to march the state militia to
Nauvoo and put the prophet in chains. The outrage felt against the
prophet of the church was a Nauvoo phenomenon based on the allegations
made by Bennett’s exposes that Jo was committing adultery. The outrage
against Joseph Smith, however, was felt by thousands of people outside
Nauvoo because a despot was growing ever-stronger, assassinating public
officials, and attempting a complete overthrow of the government, all
under the garb of religious fanaticism. Dependent upon who you were,
what your religion was, or where you lived, you may be mad at Jo for
different reasons. The next passage in Jo’s journal documenting what
Carlin told William Clayton reveals that the outrage wasn’t only in
Nauvoo as the previous passage had indicated.

> He afterwards stated when conversing on another subject that “persons
> were offering their services every day either in person or by letter
> and held themselves in readiness to come against us whenever he should
> call upon them, but he never had had the least idea of calling out the
> Militia neither had he thought it necessary. There was evidently a
> contradiction in his assertions in the above instances and although he
> said “there was no excitement but amongst the~~m~~ Mormons” it is
> evident he knew better. He also said that it was his opinion that if
> president Joseph would give himself up to the Sheriff he would be
> honorably acquited and the matter would be ended; but on [Judge
> Ralston](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#18186227449840758234) asking

> was to get back?
> the [Gov.](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#11431892504529649128) was
> evidently at a loss what to say but made light of the matter as though
> he thought it might be easily done.

What Clayton reported to Jo about this interaction reveals that Governor
Carlin was torn. It would have been easiest for him if a vigilante mob
found Jo and lynched him in the streets. However, Jo was in hiding and
safe within the confines of his kingdom and his closest elites wouldn’t
betray him, not yet anyway. Whatever happened to Jo, Carlin always had
to be at an arm’s length to plausibly deny any part in the arrest or
death of Joseph Smith. If it could be assumed by any Mormons that Jo
felt the wrath of law as a result of Carlin’s actions, he’d never be
elected again while he represented the Mormon voting bloc. But, what
does it look like on a Governor’s reputation to have a sovereign
uprising of religious fanatics in your constituency and have to call out
the state militia to put it down? Carlin was completely stuck. However,
if Jo happened to be in town and found by an enemy mob and lynched which
could never be tied back to Carlin, maybe the problem solves itself. So,
Carlin telling Clayton that Jo had nothing to fear may have had some
ulterior motives.

Jo had what information he needed concerning Carlin’s true alignment. To
conclude that entry in his journal:

> He took great care to state that it was not his advice that Mr Smith
> should give himself up but thought it would be soonest decided. It
> appeared evident that we have no great things to expect
> from [Carlin](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/53#11568123119824643057) as
> it is evident he is no friend. He acknowledged his ignorance of the
> law touching the case in plain terms.

After Emma wrote this letter she went to Jo and told him that he’d be
safest in town where she could keep an eye on him. Accordingly, Jo was
moved back to Nauvoo on August 18<sup>th</sup> or 19<sup>th</sup>.

As recounted by Newel and Avery in their fantastic book on Emma, Mormon
Enigma.

> This same day Emma learned that Harmon T. Wilson, the sheriff from the
> county seat at Carthage, had come to Nauvoo in disguise and had taken
> lodging in the Davis tavern. A rumor reached Emma that Carlin was
> ready to issue a new writ and that Joseph’s hiding place was known.
> She slipped out of her home in the dark of night and made her way with
> the faithful Derby to the Sayers farm to warn Joseph. Emma and Joseph
> and Erastus Derby left the Sayers place immediately and traveled
> unnoticed to Carlos Granger’s house in Nauvoo, where in spite of the
> hour they were “kindly received and well-treated.” Emma returned home
> reassured that Joseph was safe.

Jo remained here in the basement of the Granger home for a few days, as
it was safe. His first day in hiding there in Nauvoo, Jo penned a
curious letter.

To put this letter into context, we need to understand that Emma was at
all times fighting to keep her husband safe. She couldn’t be seen acting
too out of the ordinary by the sheriff who still had a close eye on her
or she would lead him to Jo. Emma couldn’t spend any time with Jo with
only a few minor exceptions. The other side of that coin meant that Jo
couldn’t spend any time with his usual echelon of sycophants fawning
over his every word. In his mind, through no fault of his own, he was
the victim of persecution and forced out of his home and regular duties
by mobocrats. Of course, we know that everything happening to him was
purely a result of his own actions, but Jo was the hero of his own
narrative and he said it best when he famously stated that No Man Knows
My History.

Needless to say, Jo eventually got lonely. This is the letter to some of
his earliest Mormon converts and friends from the earliest Kirtland days
of Mormonism. You’ll find a link to this in the show notes. It’s one of
the few letters Jo actually wrote himself instead of dictating, you’ll
see why.

Joseph Smith 

Yeah, so Emma had been working to keep the church running in Jo’s
absence, had written a letter to the Governor of the state on his
behalf, was taking care of the kids, and even helped sneak Jo back into
town from his previous hiding place. Yet, as soon as she turns her back,
he sends a letter to the Whitneys asking them to come meet him in the
middle of the night and make sure they aren’t seen by Emma when they get
there.

To put this into deeper context, I quote again from Mormon Enigma p. 125

> The following day, August 18, 1842, Joseph wrote another letter (the
> letter we just read). Three weeks earlier, on July 27, in the presence

> day.

What does this letter mean? There’s a lot to tease out of it and
historians are all over the place about what the true intent of this
letter is. Unfortunately, the intent isn’t readily apparent when the
letter is read in its entirety. Was this a love-letter from Jo to Sarah?
Well it was addressed to the entire Whitney family and a booty calls are
really awkward with Sarah’s parents there. But they had both consented 3
weeks earlier to Jo taking their daughter as one of his wives, so maybe
it’s not completely crazy to infer a booty call was the purpose of this
letter.

Maybe Jo was just really lonely and wanted some good long-time friends
as company while in hiding. That seems to comport with him saying “the
time of my absence from you seems so long, and dreary, that it seems, as
if I could not live long in this way: and \<if you\> three would come
and see me in this my lonely retreat, it would afford me great relief,
of mind,” But, if this is just a letter about Jo wanting the company of
the three Whitneys, why did he ask them to avoid Emma and burn the
letter after reading? That can be explained by the fact that Emma was
being tailed by the Sheriff in hopes she’d lead him to Jo’s hideout.
Also, the letter told Jo’s location, a paper trail, of course he’d want
it burned.

If Jo was just seeking companionship with some of his closest friends,
why was it only the Whitneys he invited. Also, why was it necessary to
tell them that he has a room entirely to himself and the whole matter
can be attended to with most perfect safety? And if they were just
coming to visit an old friend, why did he also have to tell them that he
knows it’s the will of God that they should comfort him in this time of
affliction or not at all? What’s with the sense of urgency and invoking
the will of God to convince them to make the trip? Why would they need
to be convinced of this?

Those questions may be answered by the fact that Jo was on the run from
the law and the Whitneys would understandably fear for their lives in
the presence of a fugitive of 2 different states, a little forceful
coercion deemed “the will of God” may have been necessary to convince
them. That with the secret knock that Newel was to use to signal to Jo
that it was friends on the other side of the door, it makes sense.

However, when we read Jo’s intentions with writing the letter in the
first place, just having the company of the Whitneys to hang out and
chat for a while seems a little too light. Jo says he’s communicating
the information in the letter to them “privetely… which I want you three
Eternaly to keep in your own bosams; for my feelings are so strong for
you since what has pased lately between us, that the time of my abscence
from you seems so long, and dreary, that it seems, as if I could not
live long in this way:”

Those are some strong feelings for people who were simply friends.
Granted, the Whitneys and Smiths go way back to the earliest days of the
church in Kirtland. In fact, Newel Whitney was the first person Jo and
Emma met when they arrived in Kirtland in early 1831 and began forging a
close relationship with the Whitneys. Jo and Emma were 26 and 28
respectively at this time, little Sarah was 5 years old. Had young Alvin
Smith survived when he was born to Emma, he would have been just 2 years
younger than Sarah when Jo and Emma first met her.

This is what D. Michael Quinn wrote of their first exchange from a
December 1978 article about the Whitney family, published by the church
currently on lds.org. You’ll find a link in the show notes:

Jo and Emma were really close friends with the Whitneys. Would deep
friendship alone explain the wording he used and the petition to the
Whitneys to keep it secret? That doesn’t seem to explain everything in
my mind. He even referenced “what has pased lately between us” which
must have been an allusion to the sealing 3 weeks prior. If this was
merely a friendly meeting, why would he remind them of what had
transpired recently between them?

A lot has been written about this letter. A lot has been written about
Sarah Ann and Jo’s marriage. You’ll find a bunch of links in the show
notes for further reading if you’re interested, including a 1973
pamphlet from friend of the show, Michael Marquardt. This marriage
represents one of the better-documented of early polygamous marriages
which exhibits Jo’s methods. Let’s dwell on the Whitneys briefly to
understand the relationship dynamic that facilitated this letter, and
we’ll return to the letter with a little more context.

Helen Mar Kimball provided a bit of context concerning how Jo
propositioned the Whitneys to take their teenage daughter to be his
wife. This was reported in the 1 March 1883 Women’s Exponent in Utah.

> Bishop Whitney was not a man that readily accepted of every doctrine,
> and would question the Prophet very closely upon principles if not
> made clear to his understanding. When Joseph saw that he was doubtful
> concerning the righteousness of this celestial order he told him to go
> and enquire of the Lord concerning it, and he should receive a
> testimony for himself.
> 
> The Bishop, with his wife, who had for years been called Mother
> Whitney, retired together and unitedly besought the Lord for a
> testimony whether or not this principle was from Him; and they ever
> after bore testimony that they received a manifestation and that it
> was so powerful they could not mistake it. The Bishop never afterwards
> doubted, and they willingly gave to him their daughter, which was the
> strongest proof that they could possibly give their faith and
> confidence in him as a true Prophet of God.

Helen also added how Sarah was willing, but that she had to hide the
marriage from her brother, Horace. Jo apparently knew that Horace
wouldn’t be alright with Jo marrying his teenage sister and Jo sent
him on a mission to the east. Just think of the twisted set of family
relationships in jeopardy with this marriage. By their own account,
Newell and Elizabeth were willing to let Jo take their teenage daughter
to be his polygynous wife, likely given him without Sarah’s consent or
fully-informed knowledge, yet they had to hide it from Horace Whitney,
her brother. This is what Helen added, which leads us to believe that
Sarah was willing, and that her mother wasn’t aware of the situation,
which contradicts another statement from Sarah’s own mother that we’ll
read in a minute.

> Sarah Ann took this step of her own free will, but had to do it
> unbeknown to her brother \[Horace Whitney\], which grieved her most,
> and also her mother, that they could not open their hearts to him. But
> Joseph feared to disclose it, believing that the Higbee boys would

> to him when learning of the course which had been taken towards him,
> which was hard for him to overlook. But Joseph had always treated him
> with the greatest kindness from the time he came to live in his
> father’s house in Kirtland.

However, that was a later reminiscence from a second-hand account.
Mother Whitney herself spoke of the situation concerning Jo and the
proposition to her daughter. This account, published in the Women’s
Exponent nearly 40 years after the fact as well, is quite revealing.

What kind of parents would give their teenage daughter to a middle-aged
man in marriage?\! Is that what you’re thinking? Are you thinking that
only because I said it? What could possibly convince them that it was
okay to do this, knowing full well what kind of life it may lead to?
Beyond that, Newel Whitney himself performed the marriage ceremony
between them, using the exact words in the spell Jo told him to say.
This is considered an uncanonized revelation because Jo takes on role of
mouthpiece of God. He begins with promising that Jo’s proposition is of
God, articulates covenants that God is making with Newel should he go
through with marrying his daughter to the prophet, and then go to the
actual words of the ritual.

That is the entirety of it. And this is exactly what had happened 3
weeks before this letter was sent while Jo was in hiding. Newel and
Elizabeth had gained all the blessings for eternity the prophet had
promised if they gave him their eldest teenage daughter, who was
literally half his age, in marriage. Now, Sarah Ann Whitney, possibly by
her own desire, but obviously coerced in ways we can’t imagine, was to
observe all the rights between her and Jo that belong to that condition
of marriage. The coercion is terrifying. The promises a person who
claims to speak for god can make, and what they gain by those promises….
I mean…. Whenever somebody asks what Joseph Smith had to gain by lying
about the Book of Mormon or his divine mandate, teenage brides and
undying fealty from her parents who willingly gave their eldest daughter
to Jo sure looks like a win for him from where I’m standing.

With all that context in mind, let’s look back at a few passages in the
letter Jo sent to the Whitneys while in hiding which sent us down this
rabbit hole in the first place.

What was this meeting? What was the purpose of it? What was the purpose
of the utmost secrecy and the demand to burn the letter after reading?
What happened once the letter was sent? Unfortunately, those are all
questions up for grabs and ripe for speculation. The letter is just
cryptic enough that the intent isn’t readily apparent. It may be that it
doesn’t require any deeper reading to understand. Jo was lonely and
asked some of his oldest friends to come hang out with him for a night.
He plead for secrecy to avoid being discovered by the sheriff so as not
to be arrested and extradited. Elizabeth and Newel Whitney had yet to
obtain the sacred sealing ordinance and Jo thought while he was in
hiding a good time for the Whitneys to “git the fulness of my blessings
sealed upon \[their\] heads”. No record exists of whether or not they
went to the prophet that night, but records of three days later exist
when Newel and Elizabeth were officially sealed together. This portrays
a Joseph Smith who was lonely and scared that he would be arrested and
killed; he wanted that camaraderie the Whitneys had given him for over a
decade by this point. Conservative estimations are best in history, but
what about wild speculations?

Speculation exists all over the map about this. Historian George D.
Smith went so far as to draw a parallel between this communication and
that of Napoleon to his lover Josephine after their first night
together. The parallels are interesting, but the situations are so
fundamentally different that it seems an exercise in futility. An
anonymous contributor to Mormonism Research Ministry postulates it was a
love letter from Joseph to Sarah and instructed Newel to bring her to
Joseph for a conjugal visit. Newel had performed the marriage ceremony 3
weeks prior so that’s not out of the realm of possibility. To think that
Elizabeth and Newel thought there wasn’t a sexual dynamic to this
marriage is simply laughable.

Todd Compton did a great job dealing with it in the book In Sacred
Loneliness. “"\[t\]he Mormon leader is putting the Whitney's in the
difficult position of having to learn about Emma's movements, avoid her,
then meet secretly with him" and that the "cloak-and-dagger atmosphere
in this letter is typical of Nauvoo polygamy."

Newell and Avery in Mormon Enigma skip speculating on the content or
intent of the meeting and merely speculate that Emma had no idea of the
marriage.

“This letter clearly indicates that Emma was unaware of Joseph’s
marriage to Sarah Ann. Newel Whitney recorded that Joseph gave them a
blessing three days later on August 21. The evening after Joseph wrote
the letter he went home under cover of darkness and spent the night with
Emma, returning to his hiding place after conducting some business the
next day.”

That’s interesting isn’t it. If Jo told the Whitneys to make sure they
don’t show up when Emma is home for the sole purpose of escaping
discovery by the Sheriff, him going home and staying with Emma the next
night sure reveals he either got sloppy or that secrecy for that reason
was never a matter of consideration when initially writing the letter.

All of these speculative lines fit within the bounds of the evidence and
share the constraints of all Mormon history. The constraints of Mormon
history may be limiting historians from reaching the most accurate
conclusions though. We don’t know what lived inside Joseph’s mind. We
don’t know what went through his mind late at night with his head on his
pillow staring up at the ceiling. We don’t know what he talked about
with his closest confidants beyond what has survived in documentary
form.

But, because nobody knows his history, it’s up to us to construct it as
best we can, which means speculating within the bounds of the evidence
available to us. My speculation? Jo was a contrarian to his culture in
many ways. Maybe he invited all three of them over for some playtime.
His new wife he’d known since he was five times her age and two of his
closest friends he’d known and lived with repeatedly for over a decade.
If Joe Smith was the sexual revolutionary people claim him to be, why is
that only limited to him having one on one encounters with polygynous
wives? A party animal like him running a criminal empire with his own
army; maybe having all three Whitneys over for a night wasn’t far out of
the ordinary. Plus, we usually had some anointing oil mixed in
situations like this, you know, various Mormon elites meeting in a small
room and seeing the face of God. Elizabeth even said that the family was
“wrapt in a heavenly vision, a halo of light encircled us, and we were
convinced in our own bosoms that God heard and approved our prayers.”
Maybe Jo really did “git the fulness of my blessings sealed upon
\[their\] heads.”

Hand wave. Scoff. Joseph Smith never had drug-infused orgies with
members of Mormon leadership, that’s contrary to the gospel\! Yes,
because Jo’s actions never ran counter to mainstream Protestantism, did
they? I know the available evidence doesn’t come anywhere near proving
that and this is terrible speculation by academic history standards.
But, since we’re all lost in the realm of pure speculation concerning
this mysterious meeting, shouldn’t we open up all possible lines of
speculation? I’ve never seen any historian claiming this as a possible
explanation for the events of that night. It may be complete
speculation, but you can’t say it’s implausible. If Mormon historians
are happy with claiming the Book of Abraham as a legitimate translation
of the Kirtland papyri as historically plausible, I’m happy to live in
this world of my own historical plausibility.

Why would such a claim be controversial or laughed out of Mormon history
academia? Jo is a lot of people’s sacred cow. Their model of Joseph
Smith operates only within very tight confines of what they think a
pious religious leader would do. But, if I’ve learned anything of Jo in
all my studies, he didn’t like being told what to do, and that includes
by the culture and religious milieu in which he lived. Is it presentist
to confine him to those boundaries? Is that good history? I guess the
question is, how revolutionary to you want your revolutionary prophet to
be?
