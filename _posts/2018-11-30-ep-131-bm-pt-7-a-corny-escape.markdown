Ep 131 – BM Pt. 7 A Corny Escape

On this episode, Joseph Smith is still a fugitive\! He opines on
relationships had and lost, loved and dead family members, and reflects
on how important his friends are. Emma Smith and Eliza Snow pen letters
back and forth with Governor Thomas Carlin. The brethren create a
propaganda packet for neutralizing the fallout from the Bennett
Meltdown. Then, a couple of public appearances lead the Sheriff and his
posse right to the prophet when his guard is down.

To President Joseph Smith

*and His Lady Presidentess Emma Smith*

Since by chance, the “key bump” has been added to you  
With its proper enlargement of brain;  
Let me hope all the thunderbolts malice may strew,  
Will excite in your bosom, no pain.

But I think if an angel were station’d in air, 5  
For a season, just over our heads,  
With a view of things passing; his optics would stare  
To behold the vague scenery that spreads.

He’d be apt to conclude, from the medley of things:  
We’ve got into a jumble of late— 10  
A deep intricate puzzle, a tangle of strings,  
That no possible scheme can make straight.

Tell me, what will it be, and O, where will it end?  
Say, if you have permission to tell:  
Is there any fixed point unto which prospects tend? 15  
Does a focus belong to pell-mell?

From the midst of confusion can harmony flow?  
Or can peace from distraction come forth?  
From out of corruption, integrity grow?  
Or can vice unto virtue give birth? 20

Will the righteous come forth with their garments unstained?  
With their hearts unpolluted with sin?  
*O yes; Zion, thy honor will still be sustained,*  
*And the glory of God usher’d in.*

published in The Wasp, 20 August 1842

Intro

Jo is still in hiding. He’s a fugitive, wanted in two states and the
Iowa territory. The Mormons are terrified and don’t know where their
leader is, he’s been missing for nearly 3 weeks. Only some of the
thinking few Mormon elites know he’s still in town, beyond that only
rumors are spreading as to his whereabouts. The Mormon movement had
cultivated a following of people relying on the presence of a
charismatic leader to hang on his every word. Without that leader, who
would such a confused and deluded sect follow? Jo needed to reestablish
his presence in the Mormon community to let the Mormons know he’s still
their leader but he just can’t be seen right now. A few pieces needed to
fall into place before it was safe to show his face in the community
again.

Jo remained in hiding for some time. He did take time to ponder on his
situation and what made him truly happy while he remained secluded. He
reflects on the love exhibited by his closest loved ones and how much he
relied on their love to help him through these troubles he’d brought
upon himself.

HoC 5:98

> How good and glorious it has seemed to me, to find pure and holy
> friends, who are faithful, just and true, and whose hearts fail not;
> and whose knees are confirmed and do not falter, while they wait upon

> wrath of mine enemies was poured out upon me.
> 
> How glorious were my feelings when I met that faithful and friendly
> band,… on the island at the mouth of the slough, between Zarahemla and
> Nauvoo: what unspeakable delight, and what transports of joy swelled
> my bosom, when I took by the hand, on that night, my beloved Emma, she
> that was my wife, even the wife of my youth, and the choice of my
> heart. Many were the reverberations of my mind when I contemplated for
> a moment the many scenes we had been called to pass through, the
> fatigues and the toils, the sorrows and sufferings, and the joys and
> consolations from time to time which had strewed our paths and crowned
> our board. Oh what a commingling of thought filled my mind for the
> moment, again she is here, even in the seventh trouble—undaunted, firm
> and unwavering, unchangeable affectionate Emma.
> 
> There was brother Hyrum who next took me by the hand, a natural
> brother, thought I to myself brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you

> 
> Said I to myself here is brother Newel K. Whitney also, how many

> 
> My heart was overjoyed as I took the faithful band by the hand, that

As I said a few episodes ago, I love it when Jo is in hiding because it
forces him to sit and write his own thoughts. It gives us a window into
his humanity. He’s not a stoic pious figure of stalwart righteousness,
he’s a human being with misgivings who frequently makes mistakes.
Passages like that previous one and this following passage really
humanize a somewhat enigmatic figure who’s been coopted by historians
and apologists for well over a century to fit into their models. I
simply like to let Jo speak for himself.

> While I contemplate the virtues and the good qualifications and
> characterestics of the faithful few, which I am now recording in the
> Book of the Law of the Lord, of such as have stood by me in every hour
> of peril, for these fifteen long years past; say for instance; my aged
> and beloved brother [Joseph Knights \[Knight\]
> Senr](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#9464692705748165441),
> who was among the number of the first to administer to my necessities,
> while I was laboring, in the commencement of the bringing forth of the
> work of the Lord, and of laying the foundation of the Church of Jesus
> Christ of Latter Day Saints: for fifteen years has he been faithful
> and true, and even handed, and exemplary and virtuous, and kind; never
> deviating to the right hand nor to the left. Behold he is a righteous
> man. May God Almighty lengthen out the old mans days; and may his
> trembling, tortured and broken body be renewed, and the vigor of
> health turn upon him; if it can be thy will, consistently, O God; and
> it shall be said of him by the sons of Zion, while there is one
> of them remaining; that this man, was a faithful man in
> Israel; therefore his name shall never be forgotten. There is his

> Knight](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#2911097511073192219) and [Joseph

This period of hiding was Joseph’s Gethsemane. Granted he wasn’t
bleeding from every pore, and he was wishing death and eternal damnation
on his enemies, just like Jesus, but you can hear the pain and sorrow in
his voice. You can feel the love he feels for his closest friends and
family members, living and deceased, and how he blesses them and records
their names in the book of the Law of the Lord, so they may attain
eternal glories and blessings for their love and devotion to the one
true prophet.

What can’t escape mention is the victim narrative read in these
passages. Jo was running from the law, he would be immediately arrested
and extradited if he showed his face in any public setting, and Jo
wasn’t much for spending time away from center stage.

Think about it from his perspective. Missouri wanted him for the
assassination attempt of Lilburn Boggs. If he was innocent, this was
completely unjustified and he’d already lost in the court of public
opinion, which was the only court that mattered in the days of vigilante
justice and lynch mobs.

However, if he did indeed send Pistol Packin’ Port to do the dastardly
deed, Lilburn Boggs needed to suffer for what he subjected the Mormons
to. He was merely exacting justified revenge for the Haun’s Mill
massacre and the Mormon expulsion from the state when the federal
Government refused to remunerate the Mormons for the troubles they’d
suffered. Now, after a just murder attempt, the governments of 2 states
and a territory were trying to killing him unjustly.

Always remember, most people don’t see themselves as the bad guy, Jo was
no different. He was the hero of his own narrative. Also, he loved
drama. He loved when people said his name and he had a flair for showy
demonstrations to excite the masses.

Besides, every day he’s gone from center stage allowed another day for
somebody else to squeeze in and take some of the limelight. Brigham
Young was standing nearest Jo throughout most of these trials and with
the vacancy felt by his being in hiding, Bloody Brigham was able to be
the public face of the church and made executive decisions, supposedly
under the direction of Jo.

With the controversy surrounding Sarah Pratt, Orson Pratt, trusted
Mormon elite since the earliest Kirtland days, member of the Quorum of
Apostles, began to murmur. Per Brigham Young’s manuscript history:

> Assisted by Elders H. \[Heber\] C. Kimball and Geo. \[George\] A.
> Smith, I spent several days laboring with Elder Orson Pratt, whose
> mind became so darkened by the influence and statements of his wife,
> that he came out in rebellion against Joseph, refusing to believe his
> testimony or obey his counsel. He said he would believe his wife in
> preference to the Prophet. Joseph told him if he did believe his wife
> and follow her suggestions, he would go to hell.
> 
> We reported to the Prophet that we had labored with Brother Orson
> \[Pratt\] diligently in a spirit of meekness, forbearance and
> long-suffering. He requested us to ordain Brother Amasa Lyman in
> Brother Orson's stead. After receiving these instructions, we met
> Brother Orson near my house, and continued to labor with him. He said
> to us, There is Brother Amasa Lyman in your house, Brother Young; he
> has been long in the ministry, go in and ordain him in my stead.
> 
> \--20-- Brother Orson Pratt was cut off from the Church, and,
> according to the Prophet's direction, Brothers H. \[Heber\] C.
> Kimball, Geo. \[George\] A. Smith and I ordained Brother Amasa Lyman
> in his stead.

Pratt dared to believe the charges contained in Bennett’s scathing
reports. Who knows what conversations were shared between Orson and his
wife, Sarah, in the interim. Orson Brain-powered Pratt had ventured out
of town the month prior and was feared by the brethren to have taken his
own life as a result of the drama and controversy. It’s understandable,
his wife and his name had been completely thrown under the bus by Jo and
Wreck-it Bennett to score PR points against each other. Her well-being
was never considered in what transpired, neither was Orson’s.

No tears could be shed, however, and Amasa Lyman was appointed and
ordained to fill the vacancy left by Brother Orson Pratt for his
dissenting murmurings against the prophet.

The brethren decided to convene in secret. Jo made his way to the upper
floor of the red brick store near his home, closed the shades, and
waited for the rest of the trusted thinking few elites to arrive. A
coordinated campaign was needed to slay the horrific accusations coming
from Bennett and the Sangamo Journal. It took them two days, Friday and
Saturday the 26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> of August 1842 to
compile the affidavits.

> In the evening in council with some of the Twelve and others, He gave
> some very important instructions upon the situation of matters,
> showing that it was necessary that the officers who could, should go
> abroad through
> the [States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#113637961132182535);
> and inasmuch as a great excitement had been raised, through the
> community at large, by the falsehoods put in circulation by [John C.
> Bennett](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#13497576975560835385) and
> others it was wisdom in God that the Elders should go forth and deluge
> the [States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#15708985599407487116) with
> a flood of
> truth;[395](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#10271364945848690213) setting

> \[Lilburn W.\]
> Boggs](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#16501589104925396676) of [Missouri](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#5278008351364985073) and
> those connected with him in his mean, and corrupt proceedings in plain
> terms, so that the world might understand the abusive conduct of our
> enemies, and stamp it with indignation. He advised the Twelve to call
> a special conference on Monday next to give instructions to the Elders
> and call upon them to go forth upon this important mission, meantime,
> that all the affidavits
> concerning [Bennett](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/1#15432725875127354828)\[‘\]s
> conduct be taken and printed so that each Elder could be properly
> furnished with correct and weighty testimony to lay before the public.

Now the brethren were armed with a good set of propaganda materials,
including what was canonized as D\&C 101 before it was excised in 1876
from the Brighamite D\&C, which was given in 1835 as rumors of polygamy
were beginning to take hold in Kirtland. You can listen to episode 209
of My Book of Mormon podcast when Marie and I read through it. But the
relevant part reads as follows:

> Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime
> of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man
> should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case
> of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to
> persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband,
> neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband.

Armed with this propaganda, a mission was conceived and 380 elders
embarked upon a propaganda campaign 2 days later. Continuing from the
manuscript history of Bloody Brigham Young:

> Met in the evening in council with the Prophet Joseph and some of the
> Twelve. We received much good instruction and counsel from Joseph,
> relative to the situation of the Church, and the policy to be pursued
> in sending many elders through the states to preach the gospel and
> disabuse the public mind in relation to the false statements of Dr. J.
> C. Bennett.
> 
> The Prophet also directed us to call a special conference on Monday
> next, and nominate the elders to go on this important mission, and
> give them their instructions; and that we should also get the
> affidavits against Dr. Bennett published, so that the elders might
> have authentic and strong testimony to lay before the public in
> relation to those matters.

While the brethren were compiling these packets for distribution, Emma
and Eliza were busy in letter correspondence with Governor Thomas Carlin
to try and clear Jo’s name. The last letter we read from Emma to
Governor Carlin was an appeal on all fronts to excuse the prophet from
any wrongdoing or false accusations that had been laid to his name.
Carlin replied with an appeal to authority, saying that the charges
against Jo concerning Lilburn Boggs’ assassination attempt were out of
his hands.

His hands were tied. He was ordered by the Governor of another state to
deliver a fugitive in his state and the Illinois Constitution says plain
and clear that he is forced to comply. Carlin concludes the letter
telling Emma he knows everything he sends to her makes its way to Jo. He
also talks about when Emma, Amanda Barnes and Eliza Snow met with him a
month prior that when he said he “would not advise Mr. Smith ever to
trust himself in Missouri” that what he really meant was to not trust
himself to Missouri mobs, but instead to the officials of the
government. Carlin claims that if Jo is truly innocent in the whole
Boggs business that he’ll receive a quick acquittal and everything will
be fine.

Emma, with Eliza Snow as scribe and likely Elizabeth Whitney as
counselor, quickly penned a reply to Carlin with some sound arguments.
However, the implied presumption of Jo’s innocence clouds the content of
the arguments, considering he was the most likely suspect to be involved
in the assassination attempt, even if he wasn’t in the state at the
time.

Now she goes on to make a sound legal argument for simply letting Jo off
the hook and ignoring the warrants sent from Governor Rylands of
Missouri. These arguments, however, only work at the city level and are
immediately superseded by the Illinois State Constitution and any
declarations by Governor Carlin.

Emma was a force to be contended with in Nauvoo. Her arguments were
sound considering the provisions in the Nauvoo City Charter, but they
fall apart at the state level when Governors are exchanging suspects in
a high-profile assassination attempt who happens to be a fugitive in one
of the states. This was over Emma’s paygrade, but it was over
everybody’s paygrade who held any office in Nauvoo. States are
supposed to be hotbeds of governmental experimentation, but that only
works if the individual municipalities within the state grant full
authority and fealty to the state government. The Mormons had no
interest in state politics, especially when they threatened the life of
their prophet. Emma, however, makes a solid case that there would be no
fair trial in Missouri should Jo be extradited. Her pleading to Carlin
to stop this sham of a legal feud was literally to save her husband’s
life. We’ll see how this plays out, but the pressure must have felt like
it was slightly relieved given what happened at the conference Jo called
which happened 2 days after this letter was sent.

That next Monday’s special conference was a chance to test the waters. A
large congregation of Mormons gathered in the grove near the temple and
Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith began with preaching. His message was largely
the same as had been said so many times from the pulpit. Go out and
preach the gospel, build churches, send your money to us so we can build
the Nauvoo House and the temple. That way we can get our long-promised
endowments and everything will be great tomorrow. However, there was one
small detail in Hyrum’s speech that really stands out, and it has to do
with tactics should the militia come into Nauvoo to arrest Joseph Smith
by force. The tactics of real military gentlemen, you’ll see what I
mean.

After this speech, Hyrum started to sit down, undoubtedly to the
downtrodden faces of many in the congregation. The prophet was nowhere
to be seen, he’d been in hiding nearly a month and only the thinking few
knew where he was. Only rumors would satisfy the congregation of Jo’s
whereabouts. Was he west towards the Rockies like he always talked of
doing? Was he hiding in the Iowa territory? Did he head east or make his
way to Washington D.C. to meet with the president again to set
everything straight? Had he completely abandoned the Mormons and fled to
Europe? The whispers of these unconfirmed rumors only further subverted
Jo’s authority in the minds of thousands of followers living in his
kingdom on the Mississippi, but it brought to further life the
persecution narrative in case any of the Mormons had forgotten the
Missouri war and their removal from the state only 3 and a half years
prior.

Then something remarkable happened…

There’s a lot to unpack in that speech. From the top, Jo preaches that
he’d been victorious against his Missourian persecutors, but was that
really true? If you’re constantly in hiding from your enemies, are you
really prevailing? Beyond that, if you’re still fighting your enemies,
whether that’s by running from them or leading them into the woods by
stratagem, how did you prevail?

Jo went on to retraumatize the Mormons by bringing up the Hauns’ Mill
massacre, saying if they would have listened to what he commanded them
to do they never would have died. He leveraged that trauma to tell the
Mormons that if they just listen to his counsel and do exactly what he
says that no lives will be lost. That’s a powerful mind-controlling
technique often seen in Stockholm syndrome. It’s rhetoric used by all
kinds of insular group leaders throughout all history and it obviously
works regardless of how false it usually is.

Then, Jo reiterates what Hyrum had said previously that if a mob comes
into town the men should flee and leave only women and children there to
stand up to the armed militia. They’d feel so dumb fighting women and
children, wouldn’t they? It’s a common tactic by most major military
leaders throughout history, right? Oh, wait, no… that’s just horrible,
self-serving, and incredibly revealing of Jo’s inner cowardice. Such a
great man to sacrifice the women and children to save himself and his
brethren…

Then he goes on to say he has a plan and nobody can question it. If
everybody will simply do what he says they’ll get some money and hatch
the plan to build the great Mormon theocracy. Finally, in conclusion,
similar to the milk strippings story with Thomas B. Marsh in Utah, Jo
made an example out of Orson Pratt while he was sitting behind him. How
dare he run off and leave a suicide note and cause half the town to go
searching for him? How dare Orson team up with Sidney Rigdon and George
W. Robinson to drag the prophet down? But, he prophesies that he will
live to give them a lashing and cursing at every opportunity and he’ll
trample their ashes with his feet, for they will be cut down in their
plans. Orson Pratt was sitting right behind him the whole time. Jo made
an example of those who oppose him or even cause him minor
inconveniences. Pratt would be dealt with in due time, we’ll get to it
eventually.

Jo appearing in front of hundreds of Mormons and most of the brethren
was a ballsy move. He need only be sighted by the Adams County Sheriff,
who was still in town, and he was done. The sheriff had learned from
leaving Jo in the custody of the Nauvoo city constable, he wouldn’t be
making that mistake again. However, Jo wasn’t done with his public
appearances for the week.

The Relief Society had scheduled a meeting 4 days later in the same
grove near the Temple. Jo made another surprise appearance, likely to
the sycophantic adulation of the crowd again. Eliza R. Snow sat near the
pulpit in the grove eagerly taking notes.

Once again, the tongue is an unruly member. The Relief Society was
formed at a time when Jo was taking a lot of women to be his polygamous
partners. Look, you can’t be a prominent public figure like Jo having a
bunch of affairs with women and form a women’s society and not expect
rumors to abound. Not because women are gossipy, but because intimacy
with the prophet was a common thing more than a dozen of these women
shared. Word was bound to spread beyond the confines of the Relief
Society. However, they were in full support of the prophet and the
Relief Society was able to put a cap on at least some of the rumors and
punish those who would divulge that information to uninitiated ears.

This was an important meeting. The people saw Jo was still in town and
still running the church, even if he couldn’t make regular public
appearances without risking his life. At what cost, though? Every public
appearance Jo made opened him up to possible arrest. The Adams County
Sheriff was still staying in town or in nearby towns trying to track
down Jo. He probably thought nothing unique of the large gatherings in
the grove near the temple, because Mormons did that all the time in
Nauvoo, but there Jo appeared. The Sheriff must not have expected Jo
there or he was in the next town over or something because he would have
arrested Jo on the spot had he seen this go down. Same with the second
appearance in front of the Relief Society 2 days later. However, he knew
Jo was in town and probably wouldn’t be hiding out far from his home if
he was still hiding in town. Attempted assassination of a Governor and
Senatorial Candidate aren’t petty theft, they don’t just go away when
the Sheriff has something better to do. The Sheriff could also deputize
anybody if needed, but if he did with any of the men in Nauvoo, their
loyalties would be questionable if push came to shove. Jo was also
protected by the Nauvoo Legion which numbered 2,000 armed, fighting men
at this time. Any situation which allowed Jo to be arrested was a
dangerous one as tensions could immediately boil over and cause a
confused conflict of some sort. Everybody had to tread lightly while
their goals or missions were all in direct conflict with one another.

Nowhere was safe for Jo, not even within the walls of his kingdom. The
Sheriff and his posse were hot on Jo’s trail and they had direct orders
from the Governors of Missouri and Illinois to bring Jo to Missouri to
answer for his crimes of conspiracy. He was too bold giving two sermons
in public only two days apart. He felt safe for a while having been in
hiding without any real danger of being captured, but this was too
close. He had to be more careful until the heat died down, but that
wouldn’t happen for quite some time.

While it may not be readily apparent, Jo’s power was dancing on a knife
edge right now. There were plenty of existential threats to his power
structure. Bennett’s published exposes and public lectures were causing
fires all over the country the leadership couldn’t keep up with. The
bankruptcy filings were being pushed through and a few people were
advising Jo how best to navigate his bankruptcy, but the state was
refusing to grant Jo any respite from his hundreds of thousands of
dollars of debt, adding stress and making any future prospects look
pretty dim. Jo’d seized the largest ferry on the Mississippi but the
business was failing under his management, the Red Brick Store was going
further into debt. Jo couldn’t run the church publicly or else he’d risk
arrest. If he couldn’t get out of the next arrest, Governor Carlin made
it abundantly clear in the last letter that the Nauvoo city statutes
wouldn’t overrule those of the Illinois State Constitution and that his
hands were tied in granting Jo any leeway.

How does this conclude? What relieves all the pressure? Jo’s world is
getting smaller every minute, he’s more constrained in his movements, in
the contracts people are willing to sign with him, in gaining more
followers with all the negative press Mormonism was attracting; it all
has to come to a head at some point. How does it diffuse?

The more important question here seems to be, does Jo even want it to
diffuse? A common theme among many apocalyptic preachers like Jo is the
ability to string unrelated events together and use them as evidence
that the whole world is headed towards ruin. America in the 1840s was
relatively stable, at least when compared with the 1810s or 1860s, but
how could somebody like Jo know that? He was constantly preaching about
how the government is coming to get the Mormons and root them out just
like the Missouri mobocrats had. Reading through the History of the
Church there are dozens of entries covering major natural disasters
which were printed in the Times and Seasons concurrent with other news
articles related to the church, all of those natural disasters played
into the apocalyptic narrative.

That is a tough question for me, did Jo want this pressure to diffuse,
or did he have other plans in mind which required even more heat and
pressure? Given events soon to transpire in our timeline, I tend towards
the latter. Jo wanted the world as he knew it to end. He wanted the
reset button. He wanted to world to burn so he could rise from the ashes
king of all Israel in preparation for the second coming of the savior.
That kind of evil can only be accomplished by highly motivated people
who’ve been told that they’ve been persecuted for decades. Plans of
overthrowing a government, or even the world, take decades or centuries
to implement, but that didn’t stop Jo from fantasizing about being the
man to usher in the new dispensation.
