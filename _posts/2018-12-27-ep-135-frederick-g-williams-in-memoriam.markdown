Ep 135 – Frederick G. Williams in Memoriam

On this episode, we hear the Sunstone Seattle 2018 presentation on the
Smith-entheogen theory. Cody Noconi begins with setting the psychedelic
stage for entheogens in religious ritualism. Then he gives us a brief
introduction of psychedelics in Mormonism. After that, yours truly takes
us on a journey into the most practical supplier of entheogenic
substances for Joseph Smith during his Kirtland ministry. After the
presentation cuts short, I walk through the parts of the presentation we
cut out for want of time.
