Ep 132 -- BM Pt. 8 2 Bennetts for 1

On this episode, John C. Wreck-it Bennett's leaving the church, Nauvoo
Legion, and city government left a massive vacuum in his absence. James
Gordon Bennett and James Arlington Bennet are appointed to offices to
fill his place. We discuss who these guys were, how they found out about
Mormonism, and what their places were within the movement after Wreck-it
Bennett left.

Before I went into podcasting, the job I was working had this general
manager who knew anything and everything about how the company worked.
He was always the go-to guy when anybody had a question or needed help
with something. This guy knew how everything in the company worked from
top to bottom. He'd been there for over a decade and a half, helping
build the company, establishing rapport with clients, learning and
optimizing every day he worked there. This guy quit a year and a half
into my time there and the void left behind simply couldn't be filled by
one person. A person under him was promoted to fill the position but he
was so overwhelmed that a new hire from the outside with management
experience had to be brought in to help pick up the pieces.

Wreck-it Bennett leaving the church wasn't just a nightmare for the
exposes and public outcry stemming from those exposes, Bennett held so
many positions of consequence in Nauvoo. Bennett was the glue that held
a lot of Nauvoo government and military together. He'd seeped into
nearly every crevasse and cured into said crevasse in whatever way he
was needed. He'd been there since the beginning of the Mormon settlement
when Nauvoo was still Commerce with just a few buildings and thousands
of Mormon refugees living out of tents and wagons. He'd pushed through
the city charter and built the Nauvoo Legion with his military training
and arms supplied by the Illinois state armory and he was awarded the
position of Major-General and inspector general for his work. He was
chancellor of the University of Nauvoo and helped develop the curriculum
in early 1841. He worked with Crazy Willey Smith and the Wasp, along
with Don Carlos Smith and later Willard Richards and John Taylor in the
Times and Seasons to publish a constant stream of propaganda to combat
any negative press coming out of other newspaper syndicates. Bennett
also had a lot of friends in really high places that he was beginning to
turn against the Mormons who were previously favorable to their plight.

The void left behind by Bennett caused the resulting Bennett Meltdown to
affect the city in ways which can't be easily summarized. Organizational
bodies and key pieces of civil infrastructure were imploding from the
vacuum left by Bennett. Jo was appointed by the Aldermen of Nauvoo to
replace Wreck-it Bennett as mayor of the city. But Jo's plate was
already so full when he was vice-Mayor that his new appointment to Mayor
stole even more time from an already thinly-spread schedule with so many
positions of authority. The system was already strained by Bennett's
departure and that whole system of Nauvoo church and city government was
under even more pressure from the outside with so much bad press with
the name "Mormon" in it. It wouldn't take much more before the stress
began to show with these structures breaking down.

Today we're going to talk about the 3 Bennetts in Nauvoo Mormonism. We
know much of Wreck-it Bennett, but there are two others who became
affiliated with the religion near the time of John C. Wreck-it Bennett's
volcanic departure from the Church. These other two Bennetts are James
Gordon Bennet and James Arlington Bennett and we're going to discuss
what roles they filled the in Wreck-it Bennett's vacancy.

Important to this conversation are the University of Nauvoo and the
Nauvoo Legion. Both of these other Bennetts had their role in Mormonism
influenced by these two institutions.

Let's start by talking about the Nauvoo Legion. I'm going to ask you to
put a pin in the University of Nauvoo for the time being and we'll pick
up with it near the end of the episode. As for the 3 Bennetts and the
Nauvoo Legion, in late 1842 the Legion was numbering over 2,000 armed,
fighting men. Service in the Nauvoo Legion was compulsory, attendance at
military drills and parades was mandatory and that was all enforced by
the 4 Bishops presiding over the 4 divided quarters of Nauvoo. Service
in a city militia enforced by religious authorities, all funneling that
power up to the prophet in chief.

Bennett's vacancy needed to be filled and it was almost immediately when
he was excommunicated from the church. Here enters James Arlington
Bennet. A little background on James Arlington Bennet. He was old
school. James Arlington Bennet was born in Dec 1788, only a few months
before the new American government officially went into effect in March
of the following year. At the age of 24 he began his service as a
lieutenant in the First U.S. Artillery division during the War of 1812.
He'd been married to his first wife, Sophia, for only 2 years when he
went into military service.

James Arlington Bennet's military training and veteran status made him a
shoe-in for a leading role in the Nauvoo Legion. Whereas John C.
Wreck-it Bennett only had military training having never served in
active warfare, James Arlington Bennet had legitimate schooling in
military and artillery tactics. Beyond that, Arlington Bennet was also
educated as an attorney and had spent much of his post-war years editing
and publishing periodicals and books. From 1832-1836 he ran the Brooklyn
Advocate and Nassau Gazette and also wrote American System of Practical
Bookkeeping, which was published in 1824 and used as one of the
curriculum books in the University of Nauvoo. He also had spent some
time as an educator and travelling lecturer.

With his resume, Arlington Bennet was a powerful ally to have with a
certain set of very useful skills. Wreck-it Bennett began his departure
from the church in April 1842 and was officially excommunicated in May.
Arlington Bennet was put in as the Major-General in Wreck-it Bennett's
place and was given the office of inspector general as well. The Nauvoo
Legion vacuum left behind by wreck-it Bennett was filled by Arlington
Bennet.

Arlington Bennet was very sympathetic to Jo and his true cause. However,
at this time, he was a jack-Mormon. Arlington Bennet held the office of
Major-General and inspector general of the Nauvoo Legion, but he wasn't
baptized officially as a member of the church until more than a year
after his April 1842 appointments in August 1843. Beyond that, Arlington
Bennet, as far as I can tell, never lived in Nauvoo. He was located in
New York until he died in 1863, which seems like it would be a challenge
for him to be a commanding officer of the Nauvoo Legion from 1,050
miles, or just under 1700 km, away.

A letter was sent from Arlington Bennet to Jo on September 1, 1842, 2
days before Jo evaded capture by slipping out the back door of his house
into the corn field. The letter is very revealing and you'll find a link
to it on the JSP in the show notes. Fun little sidenote, because this
was correspondence between the commander in chief and a Major-General of
the Nauvoo legion, each page has written at the bottom "This letter is
to be considered strictly Confidential". Arlington Bennet is entirely
reasonable about military conflict between the Nauvoo Legion and the
Missouri or Illinois militias, while at the same time very sympathetic
to Jo's plight. He was a very loyal jack-Mormon; however, his own
motivations and pursuit of grandeur definitely reveal themselves. Beyond
that, he also clearly reveals his desire for a Christian overthrow of
the government. Arlington Bennet seems to be just as much a kindred
spirit with Jo as Wreck-it Bennett was.

There's a bit to tease out of that letter, including Arlington Bennet
talking about James Gordon Bennett with the New York Herald, we'll get
to that in a minute once we introduce James Gordon Bennett with a little
background. First, the letter.

He began with telling Jo that his best option is to remain in hiding
until the heat blows over. He also says that Jo has been wrongly branded
as responsible for the Boggs assassination attempt and that any court
would find in his favor. Then it turns. Arlington Bennet tells of his
sympathies towards the Momrons and that he's a "Philosophical Christian"
who "wish\[es\] to see an entire change in the religious world."
Consider that within the context of the remaining paragraphs in the
letter. With respect to the generated conflict as a result of the
Wreck-it Bennett expose, Jo sent a letter to Arlington Bennet to come
take command of the Nauvoo Legion. Apparently Arlington was accused of
corresponding with Governor Carlin about the matter, which he said is
all a ruse. But, if somebody is going to take command of the largest
private militia in your state, as a governor, you should know about that
and should at least have a meeting with this person to learn what their
intentions are. It strains credulity to think that Arlington Bennet and
Governor Carlin hadn't been in touch prior to Jo sending the letter to
Arlington Bennet telling him to get out to Nauvoo to take control of the
Legion.

The crowning jewel of this letter is the way Arlington characterizes
what will result from all this public conflict... "On the whole you will
only be made a greater Prophet & a greater man a greater Emperor by the
affection & consideration of your good friends." Near the beginning of
the letter, Arlington had said that he "most ardently wish that you
\[Joseph Smith\] had one hundred thousand true men
at [Nauvoo](https://josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-from-james-arlington-bennet-1-september-1842/1#3020006385242572757) &
that I had the command of them--- Times & things would soon alter. I
hope to see the day before I die that such an Army will dictate terms
from [Nauvoo](https://josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-from-james-arlington-bennet-1-september-1842/1#18247149745220165600) to
the enemies of the Mormon people. I say this in the most perfect
candor as I have nothing to gain by the Mormons". Yes, Arlington was
acting purely altruistically here. With Jo at the head of 100,000
fighting men all taking orders directly from Nauvoo instead of
Washington and Arlington at Jo's right hand, he had nothing to gain by
the Mormons... Those are things he wrote down in the same letter. Like
those were thoughts he had, then he wrote them, then he sent the letter
to Jo after he had those thoughts. We can already see at the onset that
Arlington Bennet is being dishonest with his intentions, the veil is
thin with this one.

Now on to the final point he discussed, James Gordon Bennett, our third
Bennett of this episode. Let's get some background on this guy to put
what Arlington Bennet said about him "making a fortune" into context.

James Gordon Bennett was born in 1795 to a Roman Catholic family in
Scotland. He emigrated in 1819 to Canada and began teaching school
there. He soon moved south to Portland, Maine and taught school there
briefly before the next year when he moved to Boston, MA and taught
school there as well. James Gordon Bennett went to work as a proofreader
and bookseller for the Charleston Courier in South Carolina before
moving back to the New England area where he worked as assistant editor
for the New York Courier and Enquirer. This was Gordon Bennett's longest
time working as a newspaper writer and editor before he finally started
the New York Herald in 1835, during the Kirtland Era of Mormonism.

Gordon Bennett's New York Herald became home to a few firsts in early
19^th^-century printing practices. Gordon Bennett's first big story that
drew in a deluge of readership was a violent murder of a prostitute in
1836. After that, Gordon Bennett went on to pioneer frequent pictures in
paper using woodcuts to print said pictures. The ease and speed with
which woodcuts could produce pictures in newspapers was literal
cutting-edge technology in the 1830s and Gordon Bennett was one of the
first national papers to regularly print pictures with this printing
revolution. Because his paper became so widely circulated by the late
1830s, Gordon Bennett was the first reporter to get an exclusive
interview with a sitting president, then Martin Van Buren, in 1839.

However, before Gordon Bennett started the New York Herald, he'd gained
notoriety as an extremely respected reporter. He traveled a lot and
reported to local newspapers what he discovered during his travels. His
first run-in with the Mormons was in New York in 1831, barely a year
after the religion had begun. He met with a number of Mormons and
reported his findings in a two-part article on August 31 and September 1
1831 under the title "Mormonism -- Religious Fanaticism -- Church and
State Party".

This article is fantastic. Leonard Arrington wrote a scathing article
about Gordon Bennett's 1831 articles in a BYU Studies Quarterly paper in
September of 1970. Arrington chose to reprint both of Gordon Bennett's
articles in their entirety in his article and concludes with a judgement
call on the part of Bennett when Arrington says:

"James Gordon Bennett's eagerness to break into print before he had all
his facts straight is not untypical of his own career nor of that of the
propensities of leading journalists of his age. Considering the state of
transportation and communication in antebellum America, newspapers were
able to "get away with" ambiguous writing, if not palpable falsehoods.
This partly accounts for the pertinacity with which early Americans held
on to the false and damaging image of Mormonism conveyed by Bennett and
other writers and publishers."

Just what did Gordon Bennett report that Arrington considered to be
ambiguous or palpable falsehoods? Well, he was one of the first
reporters to notice some powerful trends within Mormonism before Jo even
had 500 followers. Here's a few extracts from those 1831 articles and
we'll discuss why this is important momentarily.

> "New York has been celebrated for her parties her sects her explosions
> her curiosities of human character her fanaticism political and
> religious the strangest parties and wildest opinions originate among
> us...
>
> You have heard of MORMONISM---who has not? Paragraph has followed
> paragraph in the newspapers recounting the movements, detailing their
> opinions and surprising distant readers with the traits of a
> singularly new religious sect which had its origin in this state.
> Mormonism is the latest device of roguery, ingenuity, ignorance, and
> religious excitement combined and acting on materials prepared by
> those who ought to know better...
>
> The individuals who gave birth to this species of fanaticism are very
> simple personages, and not known until this thrust them into notice.
> They are the old and young Joe Smith's Harris a farmer, Ringdon
> \[sic\] a sort of preacher on general religion from Ohio, together
> with several other persons equally infatuated, cunning, and
> hypocritic...
>
> Young Joe, who afterwards figured so largely in the Mormon religion,
> was at that period a careless, indolent, idle, and shiftless fellow.
> He hung round the villages and strolled round the taverns without any
> end or aim---without any positive defect or as little merit in his
> character...

The article then goes on to talk about a gentleman from Ohio that the
treasure diggers tried to bring in to help them find treasure prior to
the Book of Mormon being published, a man by the name of Henry Rangdon
or Ringdon, to which Leonard Arrington editorializes with \[note how
precise Bennett is in his reporting!\], as if to claim that Gordon
Bennett making a mistake in the way Rigdon was spelled means that the
entire article is false. Such is the argumentation of the 1970s Mormon
apologist. However, Gordon Bennett does report explicitly that when
Rigdon came along that the excavation for the gold plates on Hill
Cumorah was made, giving a detailed description of the specific hill.
Gordon Bennett even goes on to say that the marks from their treasure
digging are visible throughout the entire area. The article ends with
"to be continued", which it was a mere 2 days later in the next edition
of the paper. The opening paragraph of the article is prescient even
today. It's clear that Gordon Bennett was operating on a level above the
sycophancy for religious political power that gripped the majority of
Americans in the day. His commentary on religion at large, and the
granular details of early Mormonism could just as easily have been
written today.

> "About this time a very considerable religious excitement came over

What would that be like, to have religions suppressing freedom of
thought and regulating and controlling the public mind? To have a body
of religionists trying to blend religious and worldly concerns
together... What a hell that must have been in the early 1830s.

Gordon Bennett goes on to remark on Mormonism specifically after
deriding the political overreach of private religious groups.

What a lesson indeed, Gordo. This was published 3 years before Howe's
Mormonism Unvailed which really detailed all the facts about the Rigdon
and Jo authorship collusion. This article from 1831, one of the first
major exposes of early Mormonism, reveals that Gordon Bennett held
absolutely no ideas in his mind that Mormonism was true by any stretch
of imagination.

So, why was that 1831 expose by Bennett important? First off, it
illustrates his career in journalism and publishing prior to his
establishing the New York Herald four years later in 1835. Further, it
establishes that he was no friend of the Mormons throughout the 1830s.
The New York Herald published multiple articles throughout the 30s
covering the Mormons in Ohio and Missouri. The Herald consistently
ascribed Book of Mormon authorship to Rigdon as Gordon Bennett had done
in this 1831 expose and saw the religion through purely naturalistic
lenses. The Mormons were deluded religious zealots lead by a despot in
Gordon Bennett's eyes. Even the expulsion from Missouri was seen as
harsh but justified by Gordon Bennett and his reporters for the paper.

With such a track record, we wouldn't expect a guy like Gordon Bennett
to align with the Mormons. However, Gordon Bennett was a guy in high
places with a lot of connections. He was also a war of 1812 veteran and
knew his way around artillery and commanding soldiers. He became a
target of the carrot method of coercion of Mormon elite near the end of
1841. By the time Wreck-it Bennett began his exposes, Gordon Bennett was
completely coopted by Jo. Arlington Bennet and Gordon Bennett were good
friends. At the same time Wreck-it Bennett was lanced from the Nauvoo
Legion like the cancerous growth many thought him to be, that's when
Arlington Bennett was promoted to Wreck-it Bennett's position as
Inspector general of the Nauvoo Legion, while Gordon Bennett was given a
position as Aide-de-camp, probably as a direct assistant to Arlington
Bennett. At the same time Gordon Bennett was given this aide-de-camp
position in the Nauvoo Legion, the New York Herald coincidentally
experienced a shift in its tone concerning how it reported about the
Mormons. As Aide de camp to the Nauvoo Legion, Gordon Bennett, just like
Arlington Bennet, remained in New York and merely visited the kingdom on
the Mississippi when occasion dictated.

Given these circumstances, Arlington Bennett published a letter he sent
to Gordon Bennet on 31, August, 1842, which Gordon Bennet published in
the New York Herald, which Wreck-it Bennett published in his expose
book, History of the Saints at the end of 1842. This letter seems to
reveal a flippancy with which the Bennetts treated their newfound
military appointments and the Mormon theocracy at large.

> From Arlington Bennet to Gordon Bennett:
>
> "Sir, As the ranking Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, I have
> received a General Order to repair immediately to headquarters, and
> assume the command, accompanied by my principal Aid-de-Camp,
> Brigadier-General James Gordon Bennett.
>
> Now, sir, I shall ever hold myself ready to defend the Mormon people,
> or any other people with whom I might be associated, against mob

>
> I have transmitted the Order to his Excellency Governor Carlin for
> instructions, while, at the same time, I shall repair immediately to
> Nauvoo, and take command of the Legion, where I expect you will
> accompany me, in conformity with its mandate.
>
> I should desire no better fun than to despatch you with orders on my
> horse Cicero, among the whizzing bullets, or blue pills of Galena.
>
> Most respectfully yours, &c., James Arlington Bennet, Inspector and
> Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion."

Galena is a ye olde turn of phrase referring to bullets in this context.
So, Arlington Bennet states he desires no better fun than to issue
orders to the Nauvoo Legion from the back of his horse, Cicero, while
under fire from the Missouri mobocrats. Arlington Bennet was a friend of
the Mormons, and his primary Aid-de-camp, Gordon Bennett, had been
swayed to favor the Mormons as well.

That letter merely captured how Arlington Bennet was approaching his
commanding role in the Nauvoo Legion and his newfound fealty to Jo.
Taken in conjunction with the letter we opened this episode with sent
one day after that previous letter, we can clearly see that Arlington
Bennet desired military notoriety. He told Jo that he had nothing to
gain, but desired to take orders from the prophet while he was head of
100,000 soldiers. Arlington Bennet could see a religious revolution
breaking over the horizon and wanted to be on the winning side. It seems
that Gordon Bennett held similar ideas throughout the summer of 1842
when he attached his name to the roles of the Nauvoo Legion.

From June 17, 1842, Gordon Bennett published an article in his paper,
the New York Herald. This article reports facts of the Mormon theocracy,
but you'll sense the tone as being from a friendly source who was
looking forward to the overthrow of the United States Government to
establish the new Mormon theocracy, Zion, the New Jerusalem.

> Highly important from the Mormon Empire---Wonderful progress of Joe

>

What follows is Gordon Bennett drawing similarities to Jo and Martin
Luther who kicked off the Protestant reformation. He glorifies the
religious revolutions across the world throughout history. You'll see
what I mean. If I remove anything from this article it completely loses
the context so I've chosen to read it from top to bottom so as not to
lose the central point of the article.

I just want to point out that the mentality captured in this article is
absolutely terrifying to yours truly. When I see people pining for a
religious revolution to build a theocracy, I see how that's played out
in history for those who speak out against religious oppression as a
result of the theocracy. This mentality still lives in the minds of many
Mormons today and we should spare no opportunity to disabuse these
people of the dangers of theocracy. Just remember Gordon Bennett's 1831
version of reporting on the Mormons contrasted with the rest of this
article. It's very apocalyptic. He constructs a narrative that the world
has been shaped by religious revolutions and the time is nigh at hand
for the next religious revolution caused by the Napoleon of the States,
Joe Smith.

This mentality is pure evil. The idea that a religious revolution is a
good thing.... Not just a good thing, but an absolute necessity, to move
the world forward, is disturbing, to say the least. I've tangled with
people who have this mentality on social media with the \#DezNat many
times. My main question to them every time is where do apostates and
gentiles live in this theoretical Deseret Nation? Where is their place
in a theocracy? If history teaches us anything, it's that non-believers
don't belong in theocracies. Believers in other religions have no place
in theocracies. What happens to those non-believers, infidels, and
apostates when they refuse to conform to the de jure religion of the
theocracy? They die. Usually in horrific and torturous ways. Anybody
advocating for a theocracy of any kind, or a religious revolution as
Gordon Bennett was in 1842, they are advocating for genocide, even if
they aren't aware of it.

Time to pull the pin out of the University of Nauvoo. I said at the top
that it would play into the 3 Bennetts so how does it factor into this
chaotic milieu of shifting military leaders and jack-Mormons? First, a
little background on the University of Nauvoo. It was established as one
of the line items in the Nauvoo City Charter passed at the end of 1840.
Susan Easton Black wrote a great article on it titled "The University of
Nauvoo, 1841-45", you'll find a link to it hosted on BYU religious
studies in the show notes.

Interestingly, the University of Nauvoo was one of those ideas that was
started but was never chased to completion. Much like the canal through
the middle of town, the Nauvoo House, the Nauvoo Temple, the University
of Nauvoo in 1842 was an accredited university by virtue of being
written into the city constitution, but it didn't have any graduates.
Beyond that, the reagents had full control over the curricula and
required books, 2 of which were books written by Gordon Bennett, but
there was no structured system to advance students to graduation. This
was a complete fly-by-night school system. As Susan Black said, most
membership role books were not preserved since then, either that or they
were never recorded in the first place because the term "organized"
isn't a trait that strikes me when it comes to anything in Nauvoo
Mormonism.

Just because the University of Nauvoo didn't have the system in place to
actually graduate students, it didn't stop the school from issuing state
accredited degrees to anybody it saw fit, or anybody who did the Mormons
a favor of some kind. Accordingly, our two new Bennetts, James Gordon
and James Arlington, were awarded honorary degrees through the
University of Nauvoo.

Another letter printed in Wreck-it Bennett's expose, History of the
Saints, is addressed to James Gordon Bennett and treats his newly
acquired doctorate of law degree with some level of flippancy.

> J.G. Bennett, LL. D.
>
> I address you as Doctor, because I am assured that the University of
> this city has conferred on you the degree of LL. D.; and this is no
> small feather in your cap, when we consider the talent and learning
> possessed by the faculty of this chartered institution, which will,
> before long, be equal, I not superior, to any college in this country.

This is completely tongue-in-cheek. The University of Nauvoo was a joke
to most people. There may have been some who thought it would eventually
be a well-renowned university, but the University of Nauvoo was a
nothing-school and people knew it. It had only been founded a year prior
to Gordon Bennett being awarded his degree, it had no strict curricula,
none of the teachers were nationally renowned in their field, classrooms
were overcrowded, the vetting process for teachers was a meeting with
the reagents who rubber stamped nearly anybody through who wanted to
teach, and it hadn't actually graduated anybody in the year and a half
it was operating by late 1842. The University of Nauvoo was simply a
joke. It may not have been totally viewed as such to Nauvoo Mormons
then, but most of the gentile world outside Nauvoo likely held no
illusions that it was anything other than a farce.

This is the 1840s though. When a person makes an appearance on TV today
with letters after their name people usually don't check if they
actually have the degrees the letters indicate. Even less frequently
checked is what university gave them the degree. When you question a
person's credentials you can just google them and the university to see
if the paperwork checks out. Do you think that process was somehow
easier in the 1840s?

So, the University of Nauvoo had a board of regents, professors, a
University Chancellor, and William Law was registrar. As the
organization continued to develop, trustees, wardens, directors, and
examiners were added. According to Susan Black, by 1844, 77 "men served
in an administrative function in the University of Nauvoo." She notes
after that, "In retrospect, the top-heavy administration, had too many
leadership layers to successfully implement all administrative
directives."

Of course, of those 77 men, well over 90% were Mormon elites. Jo, Hyrum
Sidekick Abiff Smith, Hingepin Sidney Rigdon, William Marks, Sam Smith,
Newel Whitney, were all members of the board of regents, while Orson
Pratt, Gustavus Hills, John Pack, Orson Spencer, and Sidney Rigdon were
among the professors teachings mathematics, navigation, calculus,
astronomy, chemistry, French, Hebrew, English, German, music, oratory
and rhetoric, and, of course, Mormon history as it was being published
in the Times & Seasons beginning in March 1842.

The Mormons had always favored education. They were striving to build a
population of industrialized educated people, but education and degrees
weren't what they needed at the time. What I mean by that is they were
living in an area with some farm land and no factories. They needed
skilled laborers more than they needed educated folk. They were working
on a 50-year plan to make Nauvoo a prominent manufacturing and shipping
area on the Mississippi, but that would require so much infrastructure
to get to the point where Nauvoo could utilize 2 or 3 generations of
educated people. They were trying to skip the growing process that most
major cities go through beginning with a small settlement, evolving into
a farming or shipping town, then to industry and business with suburbs
on the outskirts of the town. Nauvoo was attempting to jump right to the
top of that growth ladder and do so by leveraging debt and political
favors.

And therein lies the utility of the University of Nauvoo, and, for that
matter, the Nauvoo Legion. Regardless of the reasons the University was
started, what it became by spring 1842 was a state-accredited
institution to give honorary degrees to people who treated the Mormons
with favors. James Gordon Bennett and James Arlington Bennet are perfect
examples of this. They were both men with high social status, Arlington
as a renowned military commander and lawyer, while Gordon was a
nationally-renowned reporter and owner of one of the largest weekly
newspapers at the time. They both had friends in high places. Now,
thanks to their friendliness to the Mormon elite, they both had honorary
doctorate degrees.

These honorary doctorates weren't confined only to these two high
society folks. John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, also
received an honorary doctorate in law about the same time that Joseph
Smith sent him his first vision account to be published in that paper.
That account is the canonized version in the Pearl of Great Price that
most Mormons know today and it mostly comes from the so-called
"Wentworth letter". That's the account Jo wrote and sent to John
Wentworth and gave the guy an honorary doctorate for publishing the
account in the Chicago Democrat.

In many ways, the University of Nauvoo was just an endless well of gifts
to well-connected Jack-Mormons. The Nauvoo Legion was leveraged in
similar ways. Gordon Bennett was granted position as Aide-de-Camp, while
Arlington Bennet was granted that of Major-General and Inspector
General. Here are a few other names that should ring bells to anybody
who's extensively studied Mormon history, all of which had some rank in
the Nauvoo Legion:

Albert P. Rockwood, William and Wilson Law, Robert B. Thompson, Isaac
Morley, Zenos Gurley, James Allred, John Butler, John Snider, Alpheus
Cutler, Elias Higbee, Henry G. Sherwood, Vinson Knight, Shadrach Roundy,
Hugh McFall, George W. Robinson, Daniel H. Wells, John Fullmer, Lucien
Woodworth, Lyman Wight, Chauncy Higbee, Francis Higbee, Dimick
Huntington, George Miller, Alanson Ripley, Brigham Young, Heber Kimball,
Parley and Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde, John E. Page, Charles C. Rich,
Alexander McRae, Amasa Lyman, Philo Dibble, the list goes on and on and
on with the who's who of Mormon elites.

All these men had positions within a state-sanctioned militia. They were
all Chaplains, Quartermasters, Surgeons, Aides-de-camp, Majors,
Sergeants, Inspector Generals, Adjutant Generals, and every other rank a
militia of over 2,000 men required. The Nauvoo Legion was a force to be
reckoned with on paper, but what did service in the Legion actually
amount to? They performed drills under the direction of a few men with
military training, but they had no Andrew Jackson or George Washington
in their ranks, nobody who could be regarded as a war hero veteran with
experience in military tactics and strategy. The drills amounted to them
marching up and down main street in Nauvoo in uniform and occasionally
running a sham scrimmage battle with dummy rounds. During Jo's lifetime,
the Nauvoo Legion never saw a battle or open warfare, they were just
thousands of Mormons in military uniform marching around in parades
because service was mandatory for anybody living in Nauvoo over the age
of 18. After the parades it was common for most of the men to head to
the nearest saloon and drink with all their friends in full battle
regalia. The Nauvoo Legion was literally a couple thousand guys playing
dress up a few times a year. As a reward for playing dress up, they got
a military rank attached to their name, paid from taxes collected by the
city, and they accomplished their only task, which was to make Joseph
Smith look far more imposing than he really was.

The University was similar in that it really only existed to give fake
honorary degrees to people who Jo needed a favor from. With these two
institutions, when Gordon Bennett teamed up with the Mormons, he went
from a respected lawyer and reporter, to a respected lawyer with a
doctorate in law from an accredited university and Aid-de-Camp to the
Nauvoo Legion. And, because he was friends with the Mormons and
published articles they wanted, suddenly he had a few hundred new
subscribers to the New York Herald. Gordon Bennett's back was thoroughly
scratched.

Arlington Bennett was similar. He was a man with major military
aspirations of taking over the country, who went from being a washed-up
War of 1812 Veteran as lieutenant in an artillery division who published
a small paper, to being a Major-General and Inspector General of a large
state-sanctioned militia with a doctorate in law from a state-accredited
university. Arlington Bennet's back was thoroughly scratched as well.

A University that doesn't graduate anybody and a militia that doesn't
fight any battles, what are they good for? Status. Social status, and
that's it. We see all these political and military movement by Jo and
the Nauvoo church and it leads me to wonder, what could actually happen
if they were turned one specific direction by a zealot. Could the Nauvoo
Legion actually catalyze the overthrow of the United States Government?
Could the University of Nauvoo ever rise to the level of being a
reputable institution?

I often get lost in alarmism within Mormon history. I see the political
movements made by the leadership and imagine what they imagine, a world
ruled by the Mormon hierarchy. I see Jo running for president and
establishing his ruling Council of Fifty and understand the endgame
behind doing so, and I can't help but think what that world might look
like.

When you do a podcast about a single topic for long enough, it gets to a
point where most issues boil down to a few fundamental points that seem
to underlie so many of the issues discussed. Mormonism's influence in
politics for its entire history is one of those bedrock issues. I see Jo
running for president and see what he wanted to accomplish and can't
help but wonder how much those institutional aspirations still exist
within the church today. The University of Nauvoo was a joke, 4
internationally-recognized universities bearing the name of Brigham
Young are no joke and they similarly have granted honorary doctorates to
people like Orrin Hatch. The Nauvoo Legion may not have ever fought in a
battle during Jo's lifetime, but the Nauvoo Legion under Brigham's
leadership exterminated thousands of Native Americans, massacring
hundreds of them in single battles. The Nauvoo Legion may not exist in
any form today, but a state full of sleeper cells with basements full of
food storage and guns is a powerful wild card to hold in your back
pocket. Joseph Smith was assassinated during his presidential campaign,
but if not for a number of factors out of his control, Mitt Romney got
dangerously close to being the first Mormon president and Mormons are
woefully overrepresented in politics with respect to their actual slice
of the American population.

As is always the case, history has an uncanny ability to forecast
possible trends for the future. The history of Mormonism is not pretty.
I can't see how its future will be any different.
