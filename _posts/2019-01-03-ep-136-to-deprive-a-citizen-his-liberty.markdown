Ep 136 –

Happy new year and welcome to 2019 everybody\! I hope your holidays were
wonderful, or at least tolerable. That probably depends on how and with
whom you spent them. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

Let’s go ahead and pick up with the timeline where we left off. Last
episode was a memorial dedicated to the celebrated Doctor Frederick G.
Williams as he departed our timeline with his untimely death in 1842. We
wrapped up 1842 to hopefully start 2019 with a clean slate in 1843.

However, something did happen in December of 1842 that we didn’t discuss
last timeline episode, but you’ll see why today. We need to understand
that Jo was under a lot of pressure to face the music when it came to
his legal status. Not only was he amidst the chaos and turmoil of filing
for bankruptcy, but Missouri wanted him extradited so they could try him
on the Lilburn Boggs assassination attempt. If they could finally try
him on all those old 1838 war charges of arson robbery and high treason,
all the better. Governor Carlin of Illinois had sworn out a bounty of
$200 on Jo and Pistol Packin’ Porter’s heads to get them arrested and
extradited before he left office. Carlin didn’t want the fugitive stain
on his record. The Governor of the Iowa territory was complying with
Governor Reynolds of Missouri’s requests to have Jo extradited should he
be apprehended in Iowa. Nauvoo was the only safe place for Jo while the
Nauvoo city government continued to expand the powers of habeas corpus
within the city boundaries, but that wouldn’t hold out forever until a
state court granted legitimacy to the Nauvoo municipal court rulings
that Jo was being held illegally.

Suffice it to say, Jo was in a predicament. Governor Carlin didn’t want
to march the Illinois militia to Nauvoo as that would be sending some
powerful messages to both the Mormons in Illinois and the Gentiles in
the surrounding areas. It may result in a battle. What was Carlin left
to do? Use the looming threat of uncertainty surrounding the incoming
Governor Thomas Ford as leverage to make Jo conform with the law. Sure,
Carlin had been handling the Mormons with kid-gloves. But how would
Thomas Ford deal with them? The party nominee before Ford, Adam Snyder,
had been the Democrat who curried favor with the Mormons, but he died
back in May, meaning Ford had made no such promises. Thomas Ford was a
giant unknown to Jo and the Mormons. With so many warrants out for Jo’s
arrest, it was pretty well understood that Ford would make extraditing
fugitives in his state his first order of business upon taking the
office of Governor.

Jo only had one rational decision left that wouldn’t lead to him
remaining in hiding, or escalating tensions that may lead to real
conflict. This was a long time coming, preparations were necessary.

Jo had resolved to appear in court at Springfield and gave himself up to
be arrested by General Wilson Law. However, they had a 130 mile or 210
km journey ahead of them to get from Nauvoo to Springfield. The journey
took nearly 4 days. The morning of the 27<sup>th</sup>, General Wilson
Law transferred Jo to the custody of Dr. White-out Willard Richards, who
joined in the company headed for Springfield.

It wasn’t just Jo, Wilson Law and White-out Willard who made the trip
though, Jo had an entourage by this point. The company was comprised of
Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, John Taylor, William Marks, Levi Moffit,
Peter Haws, Edward Hunter, Theodore Turley, Dr. Tate, Shadrach Roundy,
and Lorin Walker. They also accrued Jo’s younger brother, William along
the trip when they stayed at his house the night of the 27<sup>th</sup>.
They also met William Clayton and Henry G. Sherwood on their way after
they’d made the trip to Carthage to acquire a newly issued writ of
Habeas Corpus, from, I assume, Stephen A. Douglas. However, Clayton and
Sherwood weren’t successful in attaining said habeas corpus writ. The
company continued on in hopes that they’d be alright.

An interesting occurrence happened while staying the night at Crazy
Willey Smith’s house. I only take note of it because it was important
enough to record during the journey to the people who recorded it,
otherwise this would completely slip mention or notice within the
historical record.

Jo reported a dream he had that night at his brother’s house.

> After retiring I stated that the purifying of the sons of Levi was by
> giving unto them intelligence that we are not capable of meditating on
> and receiving all the intelligence which belongs to an immortal state.
> It is too powerful for our faculties.

Then the intelligence that was poured out over supper must have kicked
in because Jo had a pretty wild dream.

> Slept with Dr. Richards on a buffalo skin spread upon the floor, and
> dreamed that I was by a beautiful stream of water, and saw a noble
> fish which I threw out. Soon after I saw a number more and threw them
> out. I afterwards saw a multitude of fish and threw out a great
> abundance, and sent for salt and salted them.

Dream divination is a pointless pursuit, unless the person reporting the
dream takes great significance from said dream. Jo lived in a world
where his dreams became heavenly visitors, so the simple fact that he
had this dream recorded during the journey to Springfield shows that he
likely saw real-world significance in his astral state. Who or what do
you think Jo saw the fishes were? Was this dream a prophecy in his mind?
Why the three different levels of fishes jumping out of the water? Why
did he throw them back? Maybe Jo’s inner conflicts were represented by
the fish he was throwing back. How many Mormons was he throwing back
into the stream and abandoning if he gets extradited to Missouri? As I
said, dream divination is pointless, but when the person reporting the
dream believes in it, at least it’s worth briefly discussing.

The next day the massive posse of Jo and his bodyguards continued their
journey to Springfield. Nothing particularly noteworthy happened during
the trip, although it was all recorded and put into the History of the
Church. Just one point worth mentioning, Jo and his friends had a hard
time finding a place that would admit them. It was winter in Illinois,
it was cold. The men needed places to sleep each night. This is a
supposed interaction between Jo and a tavern owner.

> I went into \[a\] tavern and plead our cause to get admission. The
> landlord said he could not keep us for love or money. I told him we
> must and would stay, let the consequence be what it might, for we must
> stay or perish. The landlord replied \[“\]we have heard the Mormons
> are very bad people and the inhabitants of Paris \[Illinois\] have
> combined not to have anything to do with them or you might stay.\[“\]
> I said to him, \[“\]we will stay, but no thanks to you. I have men
> enough to take the town, and if we must freeze, we will freeze by the
> burning of these houses.\[“\] The taverns were then opened, and we
> were accommodated,…

It seems that interaction alone reveals a lot about Jo’s character. The
Mormons had a bad reputation across most of Illinois. The landlord
denied serving Jo and his friends for understandable reasons, and Jo
threatened the man with burning and pillaging the town if he didn’t
admit them. The prophet was stressed at this time and was under arrest,
albeit by his best friends, but that doesn’t excuse threatening people
with death or complete destruction of all their property because they
didn’t give you a place to sleep that night.

The next day when they left the tavern is a bit interesting as Jo had an
interaction with General Wilson Law concerning the Sun and the Moon.

> General Law asked why the sun was called masculine and the moon
> feminine? I replied that the root of masculine is stronger, and of
> feminine weaker. The sun is a governing planet to certain planets,
> while the moon borrows her light from the sun and is less or weaker.

Yep, Jo the progressive. His answer has roots in magic and occult just
as much as it does blatant sexism.

Once the men arrived in Springfield on the evening of the
30<sup>th</sup> of December, the court had already been hearing the case
for 2 days prior. Jo’s legal counsel had been defending him and
presenting evidence in his favor in hopes of getting the State court to
sustain the ruling of the Nauvoo municipal court that there was no
evidence by which to arrest or convict Jo on the assassination attempt
of Ex-Governor Lilburn Boggs.

Once Jo was there to represent himself, he spoke at length in the court
of what trials he and the Mormons had suffered at the hands of the
Missourians. Undoubtedly, he was attempting to gain their sympathies by
telling the Mormon persecution narrative version of events. However, the
court records from the November 1838 court of inquiry were a matter or
public record at this point. The Judge had likely read all of the
documents to see what the court of inquiry had found in its
investigation, so the arguments that all of the problems Jo was
experiencing were purely religious persecution likely didn’t hold water.

Jo, however, did make the case that prior to the court of inquiry,
General Clark had acted improperly when he held the court martial and
condemned Jo to be shot in the public square of Far West the next
morning. The order was objected to by General Doniphan and Jo was
instead taken to Richmond for the court of inquiry. Jo made the case
that he never acted in the capacity of a military leader and that this
court martial was nothing more than General Clark trying to murder the
prophet in cold blood.

At the end of this day, Jo petitioned the state court for an official
writ of habeas corpus in the matter. The court issued the writ and
adjourned until January 5<sup>th</sup> of 1843 to ascertain the legality
of the writ and determine if Jo should be extradited to Missouri or
released on the writ. Now, just as we did with the November court of
inquiry, I’m going to read extensively from the court documents to
determine the outcome of this trial. You’ll find the entire court
transcript on the Joseph Smith Papers linked in the show notes.

With Justin Butterfield and Benjamin Stephenson Edwards representing Jo
and Josiah Lamborn as attorney general for the state of Illinois, this
is how the case proceeded.

Since Governor-elect Thomas Ford had just taken over the mantle of
Governor of Illinois as this proceeding was underway, a requisition by
Ford was also admitted to the court as evidence of his compliance with
the initial requisition from Governor Reynolds to Governor Carlin
concerning the extradition warrant.

> Now, therefore, I, [Thomas

Then the attorney general of Illinois, Josiah Lamborn laid out his case
that the writ of habeas corpus issued on the 31st of December was not
valid and that Jo should be handed constable Edward Ford for the purpose
of extradition to Missouri. Lamborn went the route of keeping the
authority of the extradition warrant at the state level, while Jo’s
counsellors attempted to make the case that this be handled at the
federal level because the issue crosses state lines. The purpose of Jo’s
counsel making this argument was that Illinois should have the power to
determine whether or not an extradition warrant from the governor of
another state has any merit. Should the case be dismissed per the
prosecuting attorney’s arguments, the state of Illinois had no
jurisdiction to rule on the merit of the arrest warrant issued by
Missouri state governor Reynolds. If this case could be dismissed, the
extradition warrant would stand and Jo’s criminality would be determined
in court in the state of Missouri with him in state custody. However, if
Jo’s counsel could get the ruling that an arrest warrant from another
state could be nullified by a court in the home state, that would set
the precedent he needed to walk free and his writ of habeas corpus would
stand. It’s a complicated bit of legal trickery, but it was an important
question the court was seeking to answer this day in January of 1843.

Jo’s counsel began their defense by producing several affidavits
claiming that Jo was in Nauvoo on the day Lilburn Boggs was shot, and
therefore could not be held accountable as he was more than 300 miles
away. This was not the argument the state was making, nor was it the
charge against Jo. The charge was against Jo as an accessory before the
fact, but proving such required a lot of evidence, for which there never
was any beyond hearsay. Jo probably never created a letter with his
signature telling Pistol Packin’ Porter to do the dastardly deed,
especially because Port was illiterate, so any conviction that he did
indeed conspire with Port would require evidence that simply didn’t
exist. His counsel thought if they could make a strong enough case that
Jo was nowhere near Boggs at the time of the assassination attempt that
the jury would see collusion as an impossibility. However, many of the
affidavits did include the fact that Jo was running military drills with
the Nauvoo Legion all that day as well as the next. Kind of sends mixed
signals when a person claims “I didn’t command one of my soldiers to
murder my greatest rival because I was too busy running military
drills.”

After the respective sides of the court made their opening arguments,
Jo’s counsel began to contend with the claims of the prosecution by
properly making Jo’s case. It was important to their case that Jo had
never step foot in Missouri since the assassination attempt, as that
would fulfill the requirement of him being a fugitive from Missouri
having fled the state. If Jo could prove that he never stepped foot in
the state since the assassination attempt, he could not be labeled a
fugitive in need of extradition to Missouri. Here are the arguments
Justin Butterfield made as Jo’s counsel. I’ve removed the legal
citations for ease of reading. If you want the actual laws and statutes
invoked by Jo’s counsel, check the show notes and you’ll find what you
seek.

The judge presiding over this proceeding, Judge Nathaniel Pope,
recognized how important this case really was. At the close of the
arguments made by Jo’s counsel and the prosecuting attorney, he
delivered a statement from the bench. I’ve decided to read it in its
entirety because it really is important to summarize the arguments.

The reason why the concluding logic doesn’t quite hold is that Jo was
not being tried on the old charges of arson robbery and high treason
from the 1838 war in Missouri. This arrest and extradition concerned
ONLY the assassination attempt of Ex-Governor Lilburn Boggs. Yes, Jo was
treasonous while he was in Missouri, but this court wasn’t determining
whether or not he was to be extradited on the old charges from 1838,
even though the assassination attempt was definitely related to the war
in 1838.

The court adjourned and reconvened on the next day, during which, the
new Governor of Illinois, Thomas Ford was allowed to enter a statement
into the public record.

Governor Ford was using the same line of prosecution as the attorney
general was, that this arrest warrant was issued by Governors Carlin and
Ford on requisition of the Governor of another state, for which the
Illinois Governor was required to honor.

Jo’s attorney then went on to make the point that Habeas Corpus was one
of the greatest rights afforded by the Constitution of the United
States. The line of argumentation here makes it seem as if the state of
Illinois was conspiring against the Mormons to persecute their prophet.
This is the point made by Justin Butterfield on behalf of Jo in response
to the attorney general’s charge that the case should be handled at the
state level in Missouri after Jo is extradited.

> and treaties made and which shall be made under their authority.”

Butterfield went on to articulate that this case falls well within the
purview of the U.S. constitution, which supersedes any warrant issued by
any governor of any state as it’s a provision governing the entire
country at the federal level. Butterfield then went on to attack the
affidavit by Lilburn Boggs as not having the proper wording which would
authorize a proper extradition warrant by the Governor of Illinois. This
was the point of technicality the entire defense was building its case
on.

More than anything this line of argumentation makes the case for the
need for an interstate police force. The Judiciary act of 1789 created
the federal marshal service that established a police force with federal
jurisdiction, but they didn’t have the power to collect information
necessary to effectively enforce laws across state lines. Federal
marshals could merely arrest somebody in any state when provided the
proper federal arrest warrant, but it wasn’t until 1908 when the FBI was
founded that a federal investigative agency was put in place to
centralize that investigative power into federal-level crimes, which is
really what this was. Jo had crossed state lines as a fugitive having
escaped prison in 1839 and he’d been charged with accessory to murder
before the fact in a state where he didn’t currently reside. That
elevated this whole issue to the federal level. Jo’s defense counsel had
a case that this should be handled at the federal level. However,
because the case was adjudicating the merits of Jo’s writ of Habeas
Corpus issued just 6 days prior instead of the legitimacy of the
extradition warrant, the counsel was making the argument that the writ
of habeas corpus at the federal level superseded the warrants of arrest
and extradition issued by the state Governors. Like I said earlier, it’s
a complicated bit of legal trickery that could easily have been
mitigated by an agency like the FBI, but that wouldn’t exist for more
than half a century after this. Given this line of argumentation,
Butterfield claims that Illinois determining the legality of a Missouri
arrest warrant is unjustified making the analogy of

Butterfield then went on to tear apart Boggs’ affidavit. Boggs wasn’t
there to make his defense as he was confined to his home still
recovering having been shot with three bullets barely half a year prior.
You can be certain that if Jo were extradited to Missouri that Boggs
would be there in person to testify as to the evidence he supposedly had
incriminating Jo in the assassination attempt, but this court in
Springfield, Illinois only had his affidavit to go on, which Butterfield
was quick to reduce to nothing more than hearsay and accusations without
evidence.

With the case made that this is a federal issue not to be handled at the
state and that the only evidence Governor Reynolds of Missouri had in
the case was an affidavit taken nearly 2 months after the fact with
absolutely no corroboration, Justin Butterfield was ready to make his
concluding remarks.

The case was made, now it was up to Judge Pope to determine whether or
not Justin Butterfield made a solid case on behalf of Jo that he should
be discharged, or if the attorney general for the state had made a
sufficient case to dismiss the trial, resulting in the extradition of Jo
to Missouri to answer for the alleged crimes.

And there we have it. Once again, Jo escaped the gallows by the skin of
his teeth. Let’s be completely real here, that’s what was at stake. If
this court dismissed the case, Jo was in custody of Illinois state
officials now who would promptly transfer him to Edward Ford to be
escorted to Missouri to stand trial. Let’s say the case was dismissed,
just as a hypothetical thought exercise. Jo would have been transferred
directly to Missouri within a week and would be held in jail until the
state of Missouri was ready to try the case. That’s what had happened
during the Liberty Jail stay, it wasn’t a result of a jury trial, Jo was
confined for the sole purpose of thee state needing time to collect
evidence to try the case. They’d had nearly 4 years to collect evidence
on the 1838 Missouri war charges and the state was chomping at the bit
to get Jo within state boundaries to try him. And that’s an important
point. Missouri would never have tried Jo on the Lilburn Boggs
assassination attempt in isolation, the assassination attempt was likely
made as a direct result of how Boggs had dealt with the 1838 war. The
Mormons were public enemy number one in the state and Boggs had botched
the situation from the very beginning of his time as Governor of
Missouri.

If Jo was taken to Missouri, his options were pretty limited. He
probably would have been bust out by his bodyguards during transit, but
that was a short-term solution as it would be seen as a hostile action
by the Mormons leading to the Illinois militia knocking on Nauvoo’s
door. If he made it to Missouri, there was absolutely no guarantee that
he would even stand trial as Jo had thousands of enemies in the state
who wanted him dead and didn’t want to wait for the lengthy legal
process to hang him. Most likely, he would have been shot in transit or
even in his jail cell while awaiting trial.

But, barring vigilante justice and the Nauvoo Legion springing him out
of state custody in transit, what would it have looked like if Jo
actually made it to trial? It would be the state of Missouri v. Joseph
Smith with dozens of credible witnesses describing everything Jo had
done in Missouri during 1838. Remember Justice Adams, the justice whose
house Jo and the Danites surrounded and forced him to sign a letter
under duress? How about the Mormons attacking Captain Bogart and his
troops during the battle of crooked river? Would Jo be able to make the
case that he wasn’t acting in a military capacity when he had 1,500
armed men standing off with nearly 4,000 Missouri militiamen before they
surrendered Far West and Adam Ondi Ahmen? What about the testimony of
the numerous defectors like Doctor Sampson Avard and Thomas B. Marsh,
whose affidavits established the existence of the Danites? Then, to top
it all off, you have the sympathy points of a recovering ex-Governor,
who survived an assassination attempt, and it’s his word against Jo’s.
Not only that, but this same governor had relieved the state of Missouri
of their Mormon problem, Boggs was VERY popular for the Missourians who
hated the Mormons, which was most of the Missourians. A court with him
and all these other trusted government officials and militia commanders,
against public enemy number one, the Mormon Prophet, even the one true
Joseph Smith. How does that play out?

The truth of the matter is, Jo evaded death once again. He’d done so
dozens of times by this point. How much further could he push it? When
will this luck run out? Sure, we have historical hindsight, we know how
this plays out, but they didn’t at the time; and that’s what’s really
important here. How many more times could Jo escape the rat-trap before
it finally caught him by the neck?

Brother Jake\! You know him everybody. You’ve heard him on Infants on
Thrones, you’ve seen his videos, and if you haven’t, you’re missing some
truly incredible comedy and genius wit. Brother Jake suffered a major
cardiac event at the end of November and has been recovering ever since.
Here’s the latest update from his wife, Erica Frost:

> Jake narrowly survived a sudden, unexplained cardiac arrest on
> November 28 that left him hospital bound for three weeks.   
> Now Jake is making remarkable progress (his sense of humor appears to
> be intact), but he faces significant neurological limitations. His
> recovery will require intensive speech, physical, and occupational
> therapy.   
> Erica and Jake are overwhelmed at the outpouring of love and support
> from friends and family all over the world; this fund was created at
> their urging and desire to help. Now that Jake is medically stable we
> have a clearer picture of what recovery will require, so we have been
> advised to raise the goal.   
> We are hoping Jake can get back to being the devoted husband, father,
> brother, son, and friend we know and love.   
> **Go Jake Go\!**  
> **  
> **Here's Jake on a medical flight to Atlanta where he will begin
> inpatient rehab. 
> 
> And you can see the picture of him smiling on the flight if you go to
> gofundme.com/gojakego

Jake’s a great dude. The family set up a gofundme that reached it’s
$20,000 goal in a few weeks, but as the update post says, they’ve
increased it. Jake has a long road to recovery ahead. He’s apparently
gained some mobility in his left side, but his right side still needs a
lot of work to catch up. The entire Frost family has a long road ahead.
If you know anything of the American health care system, you know that
even $40k isn’t going to go very far, especially with inpatient
rehabilitation.

In light of the increased goal, we’re extending our fundraiser for Jake
through January, let’s see if we can’t get the Frost family the support
they need. At the time of recording, they’re right around $11k short of
the goal, are y’all willing to help the frost family make that extended
goal?

How does this fundraiser work? You go to gofundme.com/gojakego and
donate whatever you’re able and comfortable doing. Then, you forward
your email receipt to <nakedmormonism@gmail.com> and you get a shout out
on the show. But, if you donate $50 or more, you get written into a
treasure dig. Donate $100 or more, and you get your likeness drawn into
the treasure dig by Mark Elwood of theglasslooker.com. What does that
look and sound like? Well, we’ve had 5 entries so far. Go to the Naked
Mormonism facebook page and you can see our 5 entrants in their very own
treasure dig. What does this treasure dig sound like? Well, without
further ado, I present you the very first installment of Ground Gnomes
Give.

<u>Brother Jake Treasure dig</u>

Bryan, Julie, Preston, Mike, Jay.

The cool autumn wind wisped across Julie’s cheeks. It’s the sixteenth
day of the moon, that explains her dreams last night, the apparitions
were of a frightful and blackened demeanor. But it’s a good night for
conjuration and trading with the spirits, may we all hope the Lord
favors us this day. She carried in a small pouch around her neck the
conjuration stone, it never leaves her side. Julie has walked this path
into the woods many times. Jay had gathered the fellow seekers to this
hallowed ground numerous times, but never did Julie know who would
attend the proceedings until she met them.

As Julie walks towards the opening in the path where she sees Jay and
three others standing with a dog, she murmurs under her breath the same
protection spell she’d recited before every conjuration.

The vipers’ iawe, the rockie stone

With words and charmes I breake in twaine,

I make the soules of men arise,

I pull the moon out of the skies.

She stepped into the opening. Stopping mid-sentence Jay gestured toward
Julie and said, “Ah, yes, our prized peeper, Julie. Julie, this is
Preston, Bryan and Mike.” He points to the dog and says, “this is Mike’s
familiar, Raphael, he’s a good boi. Gentlemen, Julie is the most
accomplished seer a hundred miles roundabout. With her help we ought to
have a fortuitous night.”

Everybody exchanged pleasantries with nothing more than a simple nod to
one another. Jay, fulfilling his usual role of facilitator, then spoke
to each of the participants.

“Bryan, you have in your hands the parchment and pen, yes?” Bryan grunts
in the affirmative. “You are to be the recorder. Your hand should bear
record of what transpires in our gathering this night.”

“What is to be done with the parchment once the record has been made?”
Bryan asked.

“What we are to do with any record of these sacred proceedings.” Jay
quipped in reply before turning to the largest in stature of the group.
“And you, Preston, have you the ceremonial dagger?”

Preston nodded in reply, “I have.”

“This is to be used only for the most sacred of purposes. Here I have
twelve witch hazel rods.” Jay hands a parchment to Preston, but this
parchment already contains writing. “You see here these symbols around
the sigil? You are to carve each respective symbol into each of the
twelve rods. These symbols utilize the rite of St. Peter to bind the
spirit once conjured.”

“What have we to fear of this spirit? Why must it be bound?” Preston
questions with incredulity.

Julie, Bryan, and Mike all stare at Preston, mouths agape, utterly
stunned that such a question would ever be asked. Jay, a man never prone
to outrage, stares dumbfounded at the direct question, all are
completely silent in the awkward interaction. Mike’s dog senses the
uneasiness and begins to growl at Preston, a familiar intent on guarding
his master spirit from those uninitiated.

Jay composes his thoughts to reply to Preston’s brazenly offensive
question. Does he know nothing of the magic he mettles with this night?
“We are to heed the warning of Doctor Sibley. He tells us that
‘distinct from fiery spirits, are a species which properly belong to
the metallic kingdom, abiding in mountains, caves, dens, deeps, hiatas
or chasms of the earth, hovering over hidden gold, tombs, vaults, and
sepultures of the dead. These spirits are termed by the ancient
philosophers ‘protectors of hidden treasure,’… whence they exceedingly
delight in mines of gold, silver, and places of hidden treasure; but are
violently inimical to man, and envy his benefit or accommodation in the
discovery thereof; ever haunting those places where money is concealed,
and retaining malevolent and poisonous influences to blast the lives and
limbs of those who attempt to make such discoveries;’. Therefore,
Preston, protectors of hidden treasure are extremely dangerous for
magicians to exorcise or call up. They envy us for our mortality and
spare no occasion to possess the weakest of minds within the group.
Preston, are you prepared to guard against all the buffetings of these
spirits?”

“I…. I’m sorry. I didn’t know what spirits we’re invoking tonight. How
was I to divine what this evening holds, I’m no seer?” Preston retorts
while holding the ceremonial dagger in his right hand, palm down, across
his stomach with his left hand, palm up, holding the blade. Jay steps
back, knowing Preston’s intention of invoking a protection spell and not
wanting to interfere.

“Ananizapta smitheth death,

Whiles harm intendeth he,

This word Ananizapta say,

And death shall captive be;

Ananizapta, O of God,

Have mercy now on me\!\!\!”

Preston finishes the spell thrice repeated and makes a small incision in
his left leg below the knee to complete the spell. A single drop of
blood seeps from the wound, which Preston takes up with the edge of the
blade. “Now we shall be properly fortuitous tonight.”

Julie, Bryan, Mike, and Jay all nod toward Preston respectfully. Anybody
using blood magic is sufficiently adept.

Jay turns to the final participant with his guardian familiar. “Mike.
You’re our most adept magnetist. Have you your trusted magnet around
your familiar’s neck?”

(single dog bark)

“Raphael and I are ready.” Mike replied.

“Preston, have you completed carving the symbols into the rods?” Jay
petitioned.

“I’m ready when all of you are.” Preston replied with indifference.

“Julie, have you your peep stone at the ready?”

“I’m always ready.” Julie replied confidently. She’d never let them down
before and it was a favorable night for a dig.

Jay felt it necessary to further warn the group of what spirits they
contend with this night. “You all know that the magician of Devonshire,
Peters, exorcised a treasure spirit which crushed him and his associates
into atoms in the twinkling of an eye, right? These astral conjurations
we seek to invoke tonight are of the most terrifying sort. Julie, you
are the one of us who can see beyond this realm. If the enchantment
becomes to great, it will be up to you to break the magic circle and
warn us. Lord help us that we may have time to flee before the spirits
wreak vengeance upon our souls and we too become dissolutioned into
atoms. Once the conjuration begins, we may only speak in terms of magic
as any other communications will chase away the spirits, and with them
they’ll cause their treasures to slip further into the earth. Do NOT
break the magic unless we are in real danger.”

Everybody nods in understanding.

Jay removes from his satchel the prepared tokens of gratitude, the
offering to the spirits that the veil between our world and theirs may
be made thin. He works diligently over preparing the offering with
mortar and pestle. As he compiles all the necessary ingredients, he
speaks over the container the binding spell of protection.

“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ + the Father + and the Son + and
the Holy Ghost + Holy Trinity and Unseperable unity, I call upon thee,
that thou mayest be my Salvation and defence and the protection of my
body and soul, and of all my goods through the virtue of thy Holy Cross,
and through the virtue of thy passion, I beseech thee O Lord Jesus
Christ, by the merits of thy Blessed Mother St. Mary, and of all thy
Saints, that thou give me grace and divine power over all the wicked
Spirits, so as which of them I do call by name, they may come by and by
from every coast, and accomplish my will, that they neither be hurtful
nor fearful unto me, but rather obedient and diligent about me. And
through thy virtue straightly commanding them, let them fulfil my
commandments, Amen.”

Julie, Preston, Mike, and Bryan stand in a circle around Jay, watching
silently as Jay worked his magic. Jay reached again into his satchel and
removed a silver chalice. Into this vessel he poured the solution from
his mortar and pestle. He first handed it to Julie, the seer, as she
would need be the first to see the spirits contained therein. She
partook and passed the chalice to Preston on her left.

As the chalice was passed from one treasure seeker to the next, Jay
quietly spoke the binding spell over the supper while Bryan furiously
scrawled the names of each invoked spirit on his blank parchment. “Holy,
Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabboth, who will come to Judge the quick and
the dead, thou who art Alpha and Omega, first and last, King of kings,
and Lord of lords, Ioth, Aglanabrath, El, Abiel, Anathiel, Amazim,
Sedomel, Gayes, Heli, Messias, Tolimi, Elias, Ischiros, Athanatos, Imas.
By these his holy names, and by all other I do call upon thee, and
beseech thee O Lord Jesus Christ, by thy nativity and baptism, by thy
Cross and passion, by thine ascension, and by the coming of the Holy
Ghost, by the bitterness of thy soul when it departed from thy body, by
thy virtue, by the sacrament which thou gavest thy disciples the day
before thou sufferedst, by the Holy Trinity, and by the inseparable
unity, by the blessed Mary thy mother, by thine angels, arch-angels,
prophets, patriarchs, and by all thy saints, and by all the sacraments
which are made in thine honour. I do worship and beseech thee, I bless
and desire thee, to accept these prayers, conjurations and words of my
mouth, which I will use. I require thee O Lord Jesus Christ, that thou
give me thy virtue and power over all thine angels (which were thrown
down from heaven to deceive mankind) to draw them to me, to tie and bind
them, and also to loose them, to gather them together before me, and to
command them to do all that they can, and that by no means they condemn
my voice, or the words of my mouth; but that they obey me and my sayings
and fear me.”

As these words are muttered by Jay, Julie grips her seer stone in its
protective pouch. The last time she removed this for peeping, she was
accused of horse theft by an unwitting neighbor. She’s among friends
this time, and this peeping was for a higher purpose, to see a higher
realm. She slowly and methodically removes the pouch from around her
neck and plunges her hand in to find her trusted peep stone. Her fingers
find their home around the carved grooves worn into the stone through so
many times of removing and replacing it from its pouch. She takes a
small vial of anointing oil from her pocket and in one swift motion
removes the stone from the pouch while pouring oil over it so as to
protect from its magical powers wisping into the night sky.

As she anoints the stone she quietly murmurs to herself, “I beseech thee
by thine humanity, mercy and grace, and I require thee Adonay, Amay,
Horta, Vegedora, Mitai, Hel, Suranat, Ysion, Ysesy, and by all thy holy
names, and by all they holy he saints and she saints, and by all thine
angels and archangels, powers, dominations, and virtues, and by that
name that Salomon did bind the devils, and shut them up, Elhrach,
Ebanher, Agla, Goth, Ioth, Othie, Venoch, Nabrat, and by all thine holy
names which are written…, and the virtue of them all, that thou enable
me to congregate all thy spirits thrown down from heaven, that they may
give me a true answer to all my demands, and that they satisfy all my
requests, without the hurt of my body or soul, or anything else that is
mine, through our Lord Jesus Christ thy Son, who liveth and reigneth
with thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God world without end.”

The conjuration is prepared. All have partaken of the supper and the
vessel is now prepared to contain the peep stone for conjuration. Julie
takes it in her hands and gently places the peep stone into the silver
chalice while pouring the remaining anointing oil into the vessel. She
brings the chalice up to her eyes to exclude the light from without. Jay
stands comfortably awaiting the conjuration, Mike Bryan and Preston
stand in a circle around Julie, not sure what to expect. They’ve never
witnessed a seer of Julie’s reputation at work. Judging from how she
expertly invoked the spirits, calling them by name, they know some real
conjuration is sure to take place this dark night.

As it nears midnight and the Moon grows in power, the oil and stone
within the chalice begin to form shapes in the darkness. Faint spiritual
light dances across Julie’s eyes, but none of the spirits are yet bound
to the treasure under their feet. Then, an arc of light shoots across
the stone, leaving a trail of gold dust in its wake. “There\!” Julie
exclaims, pointing to an empty point on the ground a few rods away.

Preston grips the dagger and lunges for the spot Julie directed. He
quickly scratches 26-20-39 in a triangle while Bryan writes the same
number upon the center of the parchment. Jay urgently looks to Mike with
wild eyes.

Mike knows what to do. He grabs Raphael’s leash and unlatches it; the
spirits now dictate the familiar’s actions. Mike removes his horseshoe
magnet from his satchel. Raphael immediately begins eagerly sniffing the
ground where Preston carved the numbers into the soil. Mike follows his
familiar, pointing the horseshoe magnet towards Raphael to communicate.

Finally, Raphael settled on one spot directly north of the 3-numbered
triangle where he sniffed for what seemed like hours before finally
sitting down looking at Mike to confirm. Without speaking a word, Mike
looks at Preston with the carved hazel rods and points to the location
Raphael sat. Preston darts to the location and stabs the first of twelve
rods into the ground. Bryan quickly scratches the location on the
parchment at the top of the 3-numbered triangle with the proper sigil in
place. The same process continues until all twelve rods are in the
ground. Raphael performed his familiar task and perfectly communicated
it with Mike as the first 4 of the hazel rods were placed at the
cardinal points while the remaining 8 were placed on the other points of
a dodecagram.

Julie began expressing a little discomfort. As Preston stuck each rod
into the ground the spirit became more resistant. The flashes of light
contained in the chalice became brighter, her stone was starting to
vibrate with so much power passing through it. Julie isn’t scared, but
she knows the guardian spirit of this treasure is not an astral figure
to be trifled with. The treasure concealed in the earth underneath the
sigil must be valuable to be guarded so heavily. Jay can see that she’s
beginning to look distressed. They’re on a limited schedule before the
spell breaks and the spirit is loosed, or, worse yet, the spirit is too
powerful and the enchantment breaks all of them.

Jay takes inventory of the situation. How much further can they go? What
does the spirit require to loose it’s power? Is the group strong enough
to withstand the buffetings of the conjuration? They could all feel the
spirit. Jay casts his eyes to Bryan who looks back, neither of them sure
what to expect. Bryan is ready to record the next process on the
parchment. Mike crouches in waiting next to Raphael, magnets in hand,
ready to begin the dig. Jay looks over to see Preston standing on the
side with the dagger still in-hand. It’s a consecrated dagger, not to be
defiled by setting on the ground lest it disappear into the ground from
whence it came. Jay turns to Julie, wondering if the spirit is still
within the binding sigil or if it’s yet fled with its treasures in tow.
Jay can read her body language, the spirit is captured but far from
subdued. The next and final step before the dig is ready to commence.

Jay walks over to Preston and takes the dagger from his hand, which
Preston willingly grants. In return, Jay hands to Preston a large
shovel. He then walks to Mike and Raphael, hands Mike a smaller spade,
then to Bryan, taking the parchment and pen back to give Bryan his own
shovel. The dig was near ready to begin.

Jay walks with the dagger to the northern point of the sigil and carves
a small number 8 in the ground next to the hazel rod. He scratches on
the parchment the corresponding point with a similar number 8. Then he
circles to the Southeastern hazel rod and carves a number 2 and marks it
on the parchment. Then to the Southwestern corner, forming a perfect
concentric triangle with the other 5 numbers, he scratches a number 3 in
the ground with the dagger, and the corresponding number on the
parchment.

Julie begins to groan with discomfort. The spell is nearly complete and
the enchantment is becoming stronger by the second. What used to be
dancing lights in the seer stone are now angry cuts of fire, brighter
than noonday sun, ripping through the dark firmament within the chalice.
She can’t look away or risk breaking the spell, but the enchantment is
nearly agonizing. She holds strong, the way only truly expert seers can.

Jay motions to Bryan, Mike, and Preston, they read his signal well. They
each gather at the numbers Jay just scratched into the ground outside
the sigil. They each take their spade or shovel and lift them in the air
above the number, ready to drive each blade into the chilled ground at
Jay’s signal.

Jay mutters in an otherworldly voice:

“Oh great and eternal virtue of the highest, who through disposition,
these beings called to judgment, Vaicheon, Stimulamaton, Esphares,
Tetragrammaton Olioram, Cryon, Esytion, Exision, Eriona, Onela, Brasim,
Noym, Messias, Soter, Emanuel, Sabboth, Adonay, I worship thee, I
invocate thee, I implore thee with all the strength of my mind, that by
thee, my present prayers, consecrations and conjurations be hallowed;
and wheresoever wicked spirits are called, in the virtue of thy names,
they may come together from every coast, and diligently fulfil the will
of the exorcist. Fiat, fiat, fiat, Amen.”

At the very moment the spell was complete, Jay scratched a number 5 onto
the parchment in the middle of the sigil. It immediately caught fire and
was consumed while Bryan, Mike, and Preston all simultaneously struck
into the circle with their shovels and spades.
