Jo’s legal troubles

November court of inquiry found there was enough evidence to begin a
jury trial against Joseph Smith for arson, robbery, and treason. He
escaped prison while being transported to Boone county. Those charges
didn’t go anywhere.

Court of inquiry documents published in early 1841, prejudicing the
public and destroying any possibility of a fair and balanced trial as
mandated by the constitution.

Governor Lilburn W. Boggs had signed Mormon Extermination Order, forcing
them into Illinois.

May 6, 1842, an unknown assailant attempted to kill Governor Boggs in
his home.

July 20<sup>th</sup> Boggs provided an affidavit accusing Joseph Smith
was accessary before the fact of the intended murder, never accuses
Orrin Porter Rockwell.

Governor Reynolds provided writ of extradition to Governor Carlin of
Illinois. Both state constitutions require governors to grant writs of
extradition from governors of other states without inquiring into the
facts behind the warrant.

Jo was taken under arrest to Springfield. His counsel argued the court
had jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case, while attorney
general attempted to argue the court had no jurisdiction.

Judge Nathaniel Pope ruled the court had jurisdiction and Jo’s writ of
Habeas Corpus was granted, setting him free.

What happens after this?

Ep 138 – Full Faith and Credit with Andrew Torrez

On this episode, Andrew Torrez of Opening Arguments joins us to discuss
the legal sphere of Joseph Smith’s troubles in 1843. He helps fact check
my take on the January 1843 trial which heard in Smith’s favor on the
writ of habeas corpus, but Jo was far from out of the woods. Andrew
helps us understand what the next step would be for the State of
Illinois as well as Jo’s legal counsel in keeping him out of state
custody. After that, we read a letter Jo sent to his legal counsel with
regards to new intelligence he’d gained from Orson Pratt. Then we wrap
up with discussing a dream Jo had recorded in his history.

Legal Counsel <http://patorrez.com/>

Joseph Smith has been on the run from the law since 1839, but more
recently he’d been hiding out since he was fingered as a primary suspect
in the Lilburn Boggs assassination attempt. He’d now been to court and
was granted his writ of habeas corpus, but his legal troubles were far
from over.

Andrew was wrong: Andrew said a couple of time that Lilburn Boggs was
former or ex governor and Senator of Missouri. A small correction, Boggs
had never been Senator of Illinois at this time because he was shot
during his Senatorial campaign. Arguably that was one of the main
reasons he was shot when he was because he stood to become the new
Missouri Senator and the Mormons simply did not want that to happen. I
didn’t catch it when talking to Andrew and I don’t think that correction
would have substantively changed the conversation, but it was worth a
quick Andrew was wrong segment. Of course I want to thank him again for
coming on and helping us navigate through that.

With everything Andrew and I discussed in mind, Joseph Smith’s legal
troubles were far from over. He’s stepped into a clearing but was
nowhere near out of the woods just yet. His friends and enemies were
well aware that he’d prevailed on this one Habeas Corpus hearing, but
that Missouri only had to get better documentation and he’d be quickly
whisked back into court to be extradited.

Upon Jo’s return to Nauvoo from Springfield, he was handed a letter from
Orson Brain-Powered Pratt, who Jo had suspected for a long time was in
league with John C. Wreck-it Bennett and Hingepin Sidney Rigdon in
trying to bring down the prophet. Orson Pratt had been disciplined for
his suspected actions and removed from his position as member of the
Quorum of Apostles, but giving Jo this letter proved to a certain extent
that Pratt had Jo’s best interests in mind. Jo immediately wrote to his
legal counsel, Josiah Butterfield, copying the letter in its entirety to
make Butterfield aware of the coming storm he faced.

From Vogel’s HoC 5:238

> Nauvoo, January 16, 1843
> 
> J. Butterfield, Esq.:
> 
> Dear Sir:--I now sit down to inform you of our safe arrival home on
> Tuesday last, after a cold and troublesome journey of four days. We
> found our families well and cheerful. The news of our arrival was soon
> generally known, and when it was understood that justice had once more
> triumphed over oppression, and the innocent been rescued from the
> power of mobocracy, gladness filled the hearts of the citizens of
> Nauvoo, and gratitude to those who had so nobly and manfully defended
> the cause of justice and innocence was universally manifest, and of
> course I rejoiced with them and felt like a free man at home.
> 
> Yesterday a letter was received by Sidney Rigdon, Esq., from John C.
> Bennett, which was handed to me this morning. From that letter it
> appears that Bennett was at Springfield a few days after we left
> there, and he is determined if possible to keep up the persecution
> against me. I herewith transmit a copy of his letter and shall rely
> upon your counsel, in the event of any further attempt to oppress me
> and deprive me of liberty; but I am in hopes that Governor Ford will
> not gratify the spirit of oppression and mobocracy so glaringly
> manifest in the conduct of John C. Bennett.
> 
> The following is a copy of his letter:--

And this is the letter which must have made Jo sweat bullets when it was
handed to him by Orson Brain-Powered Pratt:

> Mr Sidney Rigdon and Orson Pratt:
> 
> Dear Friends:--It is a long time since I have written to you, and I
> should now much desire to see you, but I leave tonight for Missouri to
> meet the messenger charged with the arrest of Joseph Smith, Hyrum
> Smith, Lyman Wight and others for murder, burglary, treason, \&c.,
> \&c., who will be demanded in a few days on *new* indictments, found
> by the grand jury of a called court on the original evidence, and in
> relation to which a *nolle prosequi* was entered by the district
> attorney.
> 
> *New* proceedings have been gotten up on the *old* charges, and no
> *habeas corpus* can then save them. We shall try Smith on the Boggs
> case when we get him into Missouri. The war goes bravely on, and
> although Smith thinks he is now safe, the enemy is near, even at the
> door. He has awoke the wrong passenger. The governor will relinquish
> Joe up at once on the new requisition. There is but one opinion on the
> case, and that is, nothing can save Joe on a new requisition and
> demand predicated on the old charges on the *institution of new
> writs*. He must go to Missouri, but he shall not be harmed if he is
> not guilty, but he is a *murderer* and must suffer the penalty of the
> law. Enough on this subject.
> 
> I hope that both of your kind and amiable families are well, and you
> will please to give them *all* my best respects. I hope to se you all
> *soon.* When the officer arrives, I shall be near at hand. I shall see
> you all again. Please to write me at Independence *immediately.*—
> 
> Yours respectfully, JOHN C. BENNETT

P.S. Will Mr. Rigdon please to hand this letter to Mr. Pratt after
reading?

Now comes Jo’s analysis of the letter in copying it word for word and
sending it to his legal counsel.

> In the foregoing the designs of Bennett are very plainly manifest, and
> to see his rascality you have only to read some articles from his pen
> published in the *Times and Seasons* about two years ago, on the
> subject of the Missouri affair. I shall be happy to hear from you on
> this subject as soon as convenient, also if you have received any
> communication from Washington.
> 
> Yours, very respectfully, JOSEPH SMITH
> 
> By WM. CLAYTON, Agent.
> 
> P.S. I would just remark that I am not at all indebted to S. Rigdon
> for this letter, but to Orson Pratt, who, after he had read it,
> immediately brought it to me.

That P.S. really exhibits how petty Jo could be, but the larger point
remains that Missouri was back to devising how to get Jo within the
confines of state custody. Bennett was working closely with Governor
Reynolds to lay out their strategy to try Jo on “new proceedings
\[that\] have been gotten up on the old charges,” confident that “no
habeas corpus can then save \[him\].”

Even if Jo wasn’t guilty to accessary before the fact of the Boggs
assassination attempt, he was still guilty of all those old charges, and
Missouri wouldn’t rest until they could finally try him in a jury trial
and get the conviction they sought. This fight was far from over.

However, this show of fealty by Orson Pratt was noticed by Jo, who
baptized him and his wife in the Mississippi river for repentance and
reinstated Pratt back into his position in the Quorum of the Twelve.
Pratt must have been elated to be elevated back to his former glory.

The same day, Jo gave a failed prophecy, which was stricken from the
original History of the Church. However, because I’m reading the Dan
Vogel Source and Text Critical Edition, we get to read the failed
prophecy. From page 242 of volume 5:

> Elder Hyde told of the excellent white wine he drank in the east
> \[Palestine\]. Joseph prophesied in the name of the Lord that he would
> drink wine with him in that country.

That’s a Joseph Smith prophecy you don’t hear much about, but there it
is, recorded in Book D-1 page 1457, with editorial note \\reconsider/
next to it, and then it was removed from the history of the church, and
thus removed from history in general. Jo prophesied he would drink
Palestinian wine with Orson Hyde in 1843, but he died a year and a half
later. What is a prophet who makes false prophecies? A liar. Just a dude
talking with thousands of people fawning over his every word.

The last point we’ll discuss today was another of Jo’s dreams. Now,
dream divination is absolutely worthless, unless the dream we’re
discussing is believed in by the person reporting it to have been
prophetic or divinatory in some way. When somebody has a dream, trying
to ascribe specific meaning to it is pointless. However, when Jo had his
dreams recorded, it needs to be understood that he regarded them as
prophetic because he regarded every one of his actions to be prophetic.
Jo lived in a world moved and shaped by the will of Eloheim. Random
coincidences to Joseph were the will of God showering blessings upon his
chosen servant. Jo standing trial for his illegal actions wasn’t the
will of proper law being carried out, it was the will of the adversary
trying to destroy the work of God on earth. Jo didn’t operate in a
naturalistic world, so when he had his dreams recorded, we can be
assured that he took great significance from them, even if this
overactive sleep state simply was what happens when somebody is under as
much stress as Jo was at this time. Here’s the dream from the HoC:

> I related my dream: “I dreamed this morning that I was in the lobby of
> the Representatives’ Hall, at Springfield, when some of the members
> who did not like my being there, began to mar, and cut, and pound my
> shins with pieces of iron. I bore it as long as I could, then jumped
> over the rail into the hall, caught a rod of iron and went at them,
> cursing and swearing at them in the most awful manner, and drove them
> all out of the house. I went to the door and told them to send me a
> clerk and I would make some laws that would do good. There was quite a
> collection around the State House trying to raise an army to take me,
> and there were many horses tied round the square. I thought they would
> not have the privilege of getting me, so I took a rod of iron and
> mowed my way through their ranks, looking after the best race-horse,
> thinking they might catch me where they could find me; when I awoke.”

Whether or not that was Jo’s dream doesn’t matter. The way he reported
his dream reveals deeper desires and intentions that must not be
ignored. What do I mean by that?

By January of 1843, Jo had spent a lot of time fraternizing with very
powerful people. I would argue that his association with Governors,
Senators, military leaders, and many other high-ranking politicians had
a humanizing effect in Jo’s mind. Let’s face it, the barrier for entry
into most government positions is simply likability, especially in the
19<sup>th</sup> century. Jo had proven through his 13-year ministry that
he was very likeable, how hard could it be to become a politician?
Besides, Jo operated by the gift and power of god. Every action he took
was via direction from his conception of God. Everything which happened
to him was by the power of God.

Jo had incredible aspirations ahead of him. There can be no doubt that
he was contemplating being president of the United States at this time.
His reported dream here reads like the fever dream state of a
revolutionary. He was in the representatives’ hall of the state of
Illinois when he was attacked by a bunch of the legislators. Then he
picks up a weapon and drives them all away. Then he dreams of sending
for a clerk so he could make his own laws that “would do good”. Good for
what? Good for whom? Then they raise an entire army against Jo and he
battles them all, and steals their best race-horse and makes his escape.

Honestly, it’s just a dream, but what better analogy for Jo at this time
in Nauvoo history? It couldn’t possibly be more apt. He was the kingpin
of a criminal empire who ravenously sought increasing power, and would
stop at nothing to become king of the world. This wasn’t just a dream,
this was Jo’s most deep-seated desires playing themselves out in his own
mind. Less than a year after this time he forms his council of fifty,
established for the sole purpose of being the governing body of America
once the secular government collapsed.

What I find most fascinating about Joseph Smith’s entire legal sphere at
this time is that he was clearly testing the system. He was the kind of
demagogue who would push everything to the point just before it broke.
He ducked and dodged every legal proceeding brought against him, many of
which were efforts to curtail his power or make him responsible for his
actions, but none prevailed. Jo triumphed over them all and when he
didn’t triumph, he simply ran away from his problems. Jo was testing
the boundaries that Americans in the 1840s would deal with before the
legal process would completely break down and vigilante justice became
the only seemingly reasonable answer.

When Jo was assassinated in Carthage, a mere 17 months from where our
timeline currently rests, the religious aspect was such a small piece to
the puzzle. Jo confounded his enemies because the average American and
the American government isn’t equipped to deal with people like Joseph
Smith. He constructed a fraudulent empire built on loans he was
constantly defaulting on. He waged war and established himself as a
military leader in Missouri, but cried foul when other military leaders
attempted to try him in a court martial. He was a libertine under the
sanctimonious garb of religious ritualism and when challenged about his
libertine nature he just said it was all from God. He knows because he
speaks for God.

Not only was he the one true prophet, he was also the primary government
authority in Nauvoo. He and his best buddies ran the town however they
saw fit. The incredibly broad powers granted by the Nauvoo Charter and
the overreach granted to the municipal court of Nauvoo made it possible
for the city to harbor fugitives, murderers, horse thieves, and when
those persons arrest was called for, the Nauvoo court would issue a writ
of habeas corpus and they’d walk.

Nauvoo was a criminal empire, run by Missouri’s public enemy \#1 after
his failed military campaign and escape from state custody there. Sure,
Jo was assassinated in 1844, but I would be willing to bet that when it
happened, there were probably a lot more people who thought it was
justified and a long time coming, than who thought that he was taken
from the earth before he fulfilled his mission.
