Ep 140 – William Miller’s Bible Math

On this episode, Joseph Smith and William Miller tangle through public
media. Miller’s prophecy of the beginning of the Second Coming of Jesus
is hotly disputed by the one true prophet. Jo goes out preaching to his
congregants, sees a comet in the sky, and gives his own prophecy of when
Jesus will return. Doctrine & Covenants 130 is revealed among all this
hubbub concerning end-of-world prophecies. Also our final installment of
treasure digs for those who donated to help Brother Jake.

Our world is going to end. Did you know that? It’s very simple. Millions
of people throughout history have claimed that the world will end, and
they’ve given nearly just as many reasons why they believe they’re right
this time and all other predictions have been false before theirs.

I guess the question would be, what does that mean? What does a person
mean when they say the world is going to end? It’s usually said within
the context of the Christian rapture, at least that’s the most pervasive
claims in my culture and probably in the cultures of many of you
listeners. The mountains will roll forth their lava, the oceans with be
filled with blood, fire raining from the sky, all the most righteous
resurrected while the unworthy toil in the hell that is left on this
terrestrial sphere. Those are fun to talk about, as is the scriptural
genesis for how such myths came to be. However, we also have entire
consortia of scientists telling us that the world as we know it will
change irreparably if we don’t alter our current course drastically.

Uh oh, did I just conflate science and religion? That’s sure to upset
some of you. I want to be very clear on something, an apocalyptic
preacher pounding a pulpit or shouting at a street corner telling people
that the rapture is nigh at hand, and a scientist making careful
predictions of global events based on centuries of data collection and
model making, testing hypotheses, projecting likely scenarios based on
previous data and coming to reasonable conclusions of how to change
course in order to preserve society and the world as we know it; those
are not the same thing. Science gives us airplanes and buildings,
religions crash them in to each other. Religions claim answers to
unknowable questions about our shared reality, science provides us
methods to test that reality and make probabilistic inferences. Those
are fundamentally different things and that hard distinction will be an
undertone for this entire episode.

However, even one of the most respected scholars of Joseph Smith, D.
Michael Quinn, advocates for drawing similarities between religion and
science. A few passages particularly stood out to me in my most recent
read-through of Early Mormonism and the Magic World View.

P. 75

P. 80 where Quinn is talking about astrology.

> Likewise, when the course of a person’s life seems to fulfill

> like the Jewish holocaust, Cambodia’s killing fields, and central
> Africa’s famines.

I’m not one to take shots at Mormon historians unless they’re deserving
because, unequivocally, they always know more than me. Quinn is just
wrong here. Science and religion are fundamentally different human
constructs. One results in assertions of testable theories based on
data, the other is assertions of untestable claims based on writings of
people who thought magic and dragons exist and that animals can talk and
people can rise from the dead. It’s simply asinine to equate science and
religion the way Quinn and many Mormon historians and apologists do.

What I find particularly interesting is when the two happen to share the
same space. When people try to apply science to religion, we get
theologians. One of these theologians contemporary of early Mormonism
was a man named William Miller. William Miller has been operating in the
back of our historical timeline the entire time this podcast has been
running, but I’ve only ever just mentioned him and his religious
movement in passing. For the Millerites, a great day was nigh at hand,
but first, a little background.

William Miller was born in Massachusetts in 1782, but his family moved
to Low Hampton, New York, which is just west across the border from
Rutland, Vermont, about 60 miles from the birthplace of Joseph Smith
near Sharon Vermont when William was very young. This was the
burned-over district near the end of the first great awakening when
Miller was maturing into young adulthood. By the time Miller was in his
late twenties he was living in Poultney, Vermont, which is a location
that should raise a flag in our minds. Poultney was where Oliver Cowdery
spent most of his early years and where pastor Ethan Smith, author of
View of the Hebrews, preached to his congregation. This is important
because View of the Hebrews has long been an agreed-upon source for
material in the Book of Mormon. Miller eventually became part of an
infantry division in the War of 1812. After that he became what we might
call a seeker, espousing deism and seeking for the one true religion. He
had an experience of theophany, which he recorded in 1845, 4 years
before his death and nearly 25 years after the supposed occurrence.

> Suddenly the character of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind.
> It seemed that there might be a Being so good and compassionate as to
> Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from
> suffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a
> being must be; and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms of,
> and trust in the mercy of, such a One.

After this, William Miller began fervently reading the Bible, searching
for patterns contained within the prophecies of the Book of Daniel and
other self-proclaimed prophets in the text. This is where somebody made
a good-faith effort to conduct science on a book of scripture. It’s a
fundamentally flawed endeavor, as definitionally no scripture can be a
book of science, but he still did so earnestly and was able to conjure
an interesting timeline to explain some prophecies.

Bear with me for a minute as I do my best to describe Miller’s Bible
math. Trust me, this is all relevant. Miller used a prophecy from Daniel
8:14. Here it is with a few surrounding verses for context. Many view
this as a prophecy of the end-times, the second coming of the messiah.

> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared
> unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the
> first.
> 
> 2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
> at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw
> in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
> 
> 3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before
> the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but
> one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last…
> 
> 10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
> some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
> them.
> 
> 11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by
> him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary
> was cast down.
> 
> 12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of
> transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
> practised, and prospered.
> 
> 13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
> certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the
> daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
> sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
> 
> 14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
> shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
> 
> 15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
> and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
> appearance of a man.
> 
> 16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called,
> and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.

Verse 14 is the important one there, the two thousand three hundred
days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. This is the verse that has
been used by theologians for centuries in trying to plot out the second
coming of the Messiah. Now, 2300 days is about 6 years and 4 months, so
why would this be relevant? Well, because in the Bible, days and years
are interchangeable and Miller decided to use the reckoning of years
instead of days as it explicitly states in Daniel. What this lead to was
placing a dot down on a seemingly arbitrary world event in Judaism to
start that 2300 year clock. Here’s a sort of timeline by William
Miller’s reckoning.

Israel was captured and carried captive in 2 Chronicles 33:11 in the
year 677 B.C.E., marking the commencement of the seven times prophesied
in Leviticus 25:28-34. The overthrow of Ancient Babylon in 538 B.C.E.
recorded in Daniel 5:30-31 precipitated what was recorded in Ezra 7:8,
which was the decree to restore and build Jerusalem, given in 457. That
2300 days prophesied by Daniel, or years by Millerite Bible math, began
after that decree in 457. So, what’s 457 B.C.E. plus 2300 years? Some of
you may be surprised to learn this, but it was conveniently 1843, right
at the height of William Miller’s reign as religious leader of the
Millerite sect. Isn’t that amazing? A bible prophecy just happens to
detail that the rapture will happen in Bill Miller’s own time when he
had hundreds of followers\! How convenient for him\!

William Miller finalized his new math theories and published on the
impending second coming in his periodical beginning in 1832. He slowly
garnered an apocalyptic religious following throughout the remainder of
the 1830s. Then, in 1840, Himes was commissioned to be his printer in
chief. Now, William Miller deserves his own Naked Millerism style
podcast that falls way outside my expertise. What he started, and how
his beliefs and health codes influenced American history, are vast and
interesting. Arguably, it was partially due to him that most American
males are circumcised today. So… thanks for that, Bill.

In 1840, a guy named Joshua Himes. This guy didn’t seem to really
believe in Miller’s theology or claims of mathing Bible prophecies, but
he was a printer and Miller commissioned him to publish the Millerite
bimonthly paper, Signs of the Times. This was incredibly common in the
time. Religions who didn’t have a printing press and a regular
periodical didn’t survive, but the Methodists, Quakers, Campbellites,
Adventists, and Mormons all had their own papers, which is arguably why
they all exist in some form to this day. Other fringe groups who didn’t
have periodicals couldn’t keep up with the inflation of other
charismatic sects like this that had their own paper. This serves to
explain some of the impetus behind why the Mormons always had
periodicals since Joseph’s earliest years in ministry beginning with the
Evening and the Morning Star in Missouri in 1832. Joseph Smith didn’t do
anything new, he just did stuff that was unique.

But, in early 1843, Miller published in his periodical this:

> “My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to
> this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all
> the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.”

This prophecy came after urging from his followers to state an actual
date of the Second Coming. Apparently, Miller was a bit apprehensive to
put specific dates on his Bible math prophecies, but finally did in
early 1843.

Because these 19<sup>th</sup>-century protestant sects were very
incestuous and constantly fighting over converts, it was scarcely
possible for something like this to go unnoticed by Joseph Smith and
other Mormon leadership. These religions were Jo’s competition in
charismatic grass-roots religious sects. Jo had a constant finger on the
pulse of the religious sphere, which led him to pen this and publish it
in the Times and Seasons in early March 1843. The subject of this letter
to the Times and Season editor to be published was a man named Hiram
Redding, who’d published his own article in the Chicago Express paper,
which makes it sound like he was a Millerite who’d had his own spiritual
theophany. I can’t find the original article anywhere in all my internet
crawling, but I’m sure it exists out there. I’m sure it would provide a
bit more context, but we can infer its themes from Jo’s letter.

> JOSEPH SMITH

Miller’s 1843-1844 prophecy for the second coming of Jesus caught fire
in the media nationwide. This was Jo firing shots across Miller’s bow.
The first rule of prophecy is you do not put definite dates on prophecy.
The second rule of prophecy is make it ambiguous enough for any world
event to be shoehorned in to fit fulfilling said prophecy. Those two
rules guided most of Jo’s prophecies, at least the ones we know of. He
had the failed prophecy a few weeks ago in our timeline when he told
Orson Hyde that he’d drink wine in Palestine with Hyde because Jo never
set foot outside the United States his entire life. If there is a third
rule to prophecies, that would be to never use world events to claim
that it is the beginning of the fulfillment of a prophecy, because that
sets into motion a definite timeframe that can come to an end. The point
I’m driving at is that William Miller wasn’t a good prophet, even though
he used Bible math to make his prophecies because when March 1844 came
along without Jesus returning, his followers looked at him like, hey…. I
thought you said Jesus would be here. Then Miller revised it to April
1844, and Jesus didn’t come again. Then he revised it to September 1844
and Jesus didn’t come again. Then it was revised to October 22, 1844,
and Jesus STILL didn’t show up, which came to be known as The Great
Disappointment, which spawned some 11 other religions, including the
Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of God General Conference, Church of
the Blessed Hope, Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, Davidian
Seventh Day Adventist, Branch Davidians, Primitive Advent Christian
Church, and a few others.

In the article that Jo penned in response to Hiram Redding of Ogle
county, he spoke of the sign of the Son of Man 3 times, which is
probably what drew his ire in the first place. And what, pray thee, was
this sign of the Son of Man that caused this Redding person to glom on
to Miller’s predictions that the second coming would happen within a
year of his article being published? A comet. Hiram Redding, and many
other believers in apocalyptic religions saw this as a sign that Jesus
was returning. This was no fly by night kind of comet. Arguably this was
the largest comet ever recorded in human history up to this point. It
came to be known as the great comet of 1843. It inspired multiple pieces
of artwork that can be found if you google comet of 1843. It also
inspired the Mexican composer Luis Baca to compose El Gran Cometa de
1843 as a waltz for piano. This comet was first discovered by
astronomers on February 5, 1843, and passed closest to earth on March 6,
finally exiting visibility of earth on April 19. This comet was bright
enough to be seen in daylight because it orbits so closely to the
surface of the sun. It’ll be making its way back around in like 3-400
years, so stick around folks and we can see the comet that lead the
Millerites to think that the new millennium was just beginning in early
1843.

What’s an absolute joy is that the media picked up on this exchange
between Jo and this Millerite. The Carlisle Weekly Herald out of
Carlisle Pennsylvania published Jo’s response in full with this forward
on April 12<sup>th</sup>. It’s written in a rather snarky tone that I
find utterly delightful, even alluding to Jo using a peep stone in a hat
to relieve many dreadful apprehensions of the end of the world and set
Miller’s calculations right.

That final line is the snarkiest of all and quite important, \[the
article\] is a sort of defense of the prophet’s moral character. That’s
what this was. Jo claimed that the comet coming was not a Sign of the
Son of Man because he was the prophet and the Lord hadn’t given him a
sign, and the Lord only speaks through his prophets. That was Jo’s way
of saying that Miller isn’t a prophet, that he is, that the end of the
world won’t be coming yet, but that he doesn’t know when it will be
coming.

This was not the first time Jo had tangled with William Miller’s
disciples. Just two weeks prior to this article being published in the
Times and Seasons Jo had a meeting with some Millerites. The details of
the meeting are lost to history, but it is noted in the History of the
Church under the date of February 12, 1843.

> Christ would come.

Of particular note in this regard is that Jo didn’t view the comet that
this Hiram Redding saw as a sign of the Son of God, but if we go to his
diary entry for March 10<sup>th</sup>, 1843, there is a description of
what seems to be the comet, which Jo calls a sign of the Lord.

5:308

> I with Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff and many others, about 7
> p.m., discovered a stream of light in the southwest quarter of the
> heavens, its pencil rays were in the form of a broad sword, with the
> hilt downward, the blade raised, pointing from the west, southwest,
> raised to an angle of 45 degrees from the horizon, and extending
> nearly, or within 2 or 3 degrees to the zenith of the degree where the

> 
> As sure as there is a God who sits enthroned in the heavens, and as
> sure as he ever spoke by me, so sure will there be a speedy and bloody
> war, and the broad sword seen this evening is the sure sign thereof.

So, when a believer in Millerism sees a comet, that’s not a sign from
God. But, when Joseph Smith sees the comet, sure as there is a god who
sits enthroned in the heavens, it was a sign of the war and bloodshed to
come with the second coming of Jesus. To this passage was added a dream
that Jo had. Just like all his dreams we’ve discussed, I only include
this because it was important enough to the people who recorded it at
the time to record it. Luckily for us, this dream comes with an
interpretation, which we’ll get to very soon.

> Last night I dreamed that a silver-headed old man came to me, and said
> there was a mob force coming upon him, and he was likely to lose his
> life; he had heard that I was a Lieutenant-general, had the command of
> a large force, and that I always sought to defend the oppressed, and I
> was also a patriot and disposed to protect the innocent and
> unoffending, and wanted I should protect him, and had come to hear
> with his own ears what I would say to him. I told him I wanted some
> written documents to show the facts that they are the aggressors, and
> I would raise a force sufficient to protect him, that I would collect
> the legion. The old man then turned to go from me; when he got a
> little distance, he suddenly turned again and said to me, “You must
> call out the legion,” and he would have the papers ready when I
> arrived; and, says he, “I have any amount of men, which you can have
> under your command.”

This dream on face could be seen as a battle cry for Jo. In his mind, he
was being oppressed by the government and he always intended to defend
himself from said oppression. If defending meant actually defending with
a military, he was ready. Maybe the world was coming to an end and only
those who would be safe would be those who had their own military to
guard them? Maybe the silver-headed old man was himself in his old age?
Maybe it was a representation of God or an angel of some sort, which
would make this a vision instead of a dream by Joseph Smith standards,
right? Well, very soon we’ll get to the interpretation of this dream
which I find even more concerning than those possibilities.

This public exchange between disciples of William Miller and Joseph
Smith himself spurned some questions and the need for sermons among
Mormons outside of Nauvoo. This entire period through the History of the
Church is rife with documenting natural disasters and seemingly
inexplicable phenomena happening in the night sky, it’s really quite
fascinating. Eventually the people living in Ramus, Illinois asked Jo to
give them a sermon on the end of the world. Jo, and a couple of his
friends, travelled to Ramus, where they were received into the home of
Benjamin F. Johnson, one of the youngest participants in the Army of
Israel during the 1838 conflict in Missouri.

Once in Ramus, Orson Hyde gave a sermon comparing the other religious
preachers with “crows living on carrion, as they were more fond of lies
about the Saints than the truth.” After Orson L’Chydem preached this
sermon, he and Jo retired to the home of Jo’s eldest sister, Sophronia
McCleary for dinner, during which Jo took the opportunity to correct
what Hyde had preached about. This correction eventually became D\&C
130. This section is revered as remarkable in that it directly claims
that Jesus and God are corporeal beings, which is absolutely necessary
to understanding deeper Mormon doctrine.

But, why else is D\&C 130 so important? What does it contain that makes
it such a crucial piece of Mormon theology? Here are a few operational
passages from it that Mormon theologians have been expanding upon since
Jo initially offered the correction to Orson Hyde during their visit to
Ramus. I’ll just say as a preface to this, the deeper one gets into the
theology behind this section, the less it can be reconciled with modern
Mormon theology. I’ll try to describe what I mean as we go through it.

D\&C 130:1-3

> When the Savior shall appear we shall see him as he is. We shall see
> that he is a man like ourselves.
> 
> And the same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us
> there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do
> not now enjoy.
> 
> John 14:23—The appearing of the Father and the Son, in that verse, is
> a personal appearance; and the idea that the Father and the Son dwell

God and the son don’t dwell in man’s heart. That departs from most
Christianity, but it serves to explain why Mormon theology today doesn’t
usually use the terminology of reborn Christianity. Like, you never hear
Mormons talking about Jesus living inside their hearts, or their soul
being bathed in the cleansing blood of the lamb, that phrasing doesn’t
happen in mainstream Mormonism. What Mormons today use is belief or
knowledge. Do you know that Jesus is the son of God? Do you know that
Jesus is our savior? Do you know that Joseph Smith was a prophet? Do you
know that we follow a prophet today? That’s how Mormonism navigates
these Christian concepts.

Then it goes on to discuss how various celestial beings experience time
as a product of the planet on which they reside, to which Jo answered
yes, but that there are no angels who minister to this earth but those
who do belong or have belonged to it. There Jo departed from most
flavors of Protestantism in the claim that angels can only be
resurrected beings and can only administer to the planet from which they
came. This concept simply cannot be reconciled with the modern temple
endowment ceremony. In the Mormon creation myth, Jehovah operates as son
of Elohim. Jehovah’s counsellors are Peter, James, and John, who operate
in the Garden of Eden in corporeal form just like Satan. This is the
creation myth, long before Peter James and John were born to be Jesus’
apostles in the new testament. How could they be angels administering to
Earth if they have yet to be born on earth and receive their bodies? I’m
sure an apologetic dodge for this contradiction exists, but I’ve never
come across it, maybe some of you have…

The next point is quite interesting as well. Remember, is was the Book
of Abraham that deemed the star nearest the planet on which Elohim lives
is called Kolob. Well, Jo provides a brief description of Kolob here
beginning in verse 7.

> But they \[the angels\] reside in the presence of God, on a globe like
> a sea of glass and fire, where all things for their glory are
> manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the
> Lord.
> 
> The place where God resides is a great Urim and Thummim.
> 
> This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like
> unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who
> dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom,
> or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell
> on it; and this earth will be Christ’s.

Kolob is apparently a planet of glass and fire, but also a seer stone
like unto crystal. In a roundabout way, this is consistent with deep
Mormon theology. It’s understood that when the millennium comes, like
Bill Miller prophesied would happen sometime in 1843 or early 1844, the
earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory. At that point,
the less righteous will remain on earth to be taught the fullness of the
gospel by the most righteous, while the apostates will spend 1000 years
weeping, wailing, and gnashing their teeth in spirit prison. After that
the great and terrible final battle between good and evil will happen on
Earth, the good will triumph, and Satan will be bound forever… or killed
or something, it’s not really clear after that. Once the great battle
has been won by the righteous with Jesus at the head of the army, then
the earth will be changed to this crystal sea of glass and fire, just
like a seer stone, and all those who dwell on it will have the fullness
of all knowledge and intelligence. I mean, we’re like 6<sup>th</sup>
circle of deep Mormon theology here, I know it sounds pretty far out
there for anybody listening who’s never heard this before, but that’s
what modern Mormonism holds to.

The point after this begins in verse 10, which discusses each person’s
individual seer stone they’ll be given which will have their celestial
name written on it. This is the Joseph Smith expansion on the book of
Revelation 2:17 where it talks about the white stone.

> 11 And a white stone is given to each of those who come into the
> celestial kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth
> save he that receiveth it. The new name is the key word.

Each and every one of the most righteous Mormons out there, who go
through the great and spacious building to make their oaths and
covenants to the secret… I mean sacred combinations, they each get a
magic seer stone with their name on it, which is the password they need
to get into the celestial kingdom. This is something I’d never heard in
church when I attended, and I’d be willing to bet that most Mormons
today have never heard this before. It’s super deep Mormon doctrine…
We’re descending to like level 7 or 8 of deep Mormon doctrine. This is
like a “this is sparta” bottomless pit-level of deep Mormon doctrine.
But he didn’t conclude expounding there, because now he had some real
prophecies to get to. Ask any Mormon to tell you about a prophecy that
Joseph Smith gave that actually came true and this is probably one
they’ll point to, while conveniently ignoring the parts that didn’t
come true. You’ll see what I mean.

> 12 I prophesy, in the name of the Lord God, that the commencement of
> the difficulties which will cause much bloodshed previous to the
> coming of the Son of Man will be in South Carolina.
> 
> 13 It may probably arise through the slave question. This a voice
> declared to me, while I was praying earnestly on the subject, December
> 25th, 1832.

Yes, Joseph Smith prophesied the Civil War would happen. He was probably
the only person in America who thought a war was coming over “the slave
question”. He didn’t even say slavery itself, just the question of
whether or not we should own human beings as property. Always the
progressive, I suppose. I’d be comfortable in saying that nobody in
America at the time thought that conflict would never arise surrounding
slavery. It was always a contentious issue since America became a
sovereign European immigrant country, because a lot was happening in
America before we got here, that’s why I say it that way. But seriously,
a person had to be completely deaf to current events and the general
landscape of politics at the time to think that no major conflict would
arise due to the Northern and Southern division about slavery. The
underground railroad was alive at this time, it had probably moved
something like 50,000 slaves from southern states to Northern free
states by the mid 1840s. Harriet Tubman was 21 years old in our timeline
right now. There was a lot happening that sowed division among
politicians and everyday Americans when it came to slavery. Besides
that, Jo gave this prophecy at a time when he was actively courting and
frequently meeting with congressmen and senators. He’d exchanged letters
with Governors of states. He’d personally met the president when he
supposedly gave his white-horse prophecy in 1839. Jo was a mayor of a
city when he gave this prophecy. He was barely a year away from
announcing his own bid for the United States presidency. Jo was many
things, a moron was not one of them. He knew as well as any other
politician of his caliber that trouble was coming and that South
Carolina was the most contentious state of the bunch that would
eventually become the confederacy. I mean, James Chesnut, the first
Senator who resigned his Senatorial seat after Lincoln’s election had
been elected to South Carolina’s Congress 3 years prior to this
“prophecy”.

I guess that’s a long way of saying that, yeah, this could have been
divine revelation from God to his servant Joseph Smith, but Jo also
could have read a newspaper and concluded the same thing thousands of
people knew long before he ever gave this prophecy. And, yes, South
Carolina was where the first shots were fired at Fort Sumter, thus
kicking off the Civil War. Jo nailed the right state, he must be a
prophet, right?

Why don’t we read the next passage to see how accurate his next prophecy
was? The way this is worded makes Jo sound like he was just berating God
over and over about when Jesus will come back, almost as if his
followers were hearing about those crazy Millerites and were asking
their prophet to give them a prophecy and he didn’t want to give a
definite answer because that violates the first and second rules of
prophet club by being too specific and having a strictly definite time
frame.

> 14 I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of
> the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following:
>

Alright, so this was an interesting prophecy, if it can be called such.
It doesn’t say that Jo prophesied it, but merely that he was praying
about when Jesus would return and a voice in his head told him that if
he lived to 85 then he would see the face of the Son of Man. Does Jo
have to be alive for the second coming to happen? This put the year for
Jesus’ return in 1890 or 91, if Jo died before then, would the rapture
not happen because he died? Also, 85 was a pretty safe age to guess. The
average life expectancy in America was 38 years when infant mortality
was factored in. After age 10, life expectancy for males in America in
the 1850s was 58 years old. Jo had barely made it past 10 because his
childhood infection that required the surgery on his leg nearly killed
him. But his life expectancy at the time was 58, so throwing out a
prophecy nearly 30 years after that was a pretty safe bet. If you’re
going to prophesy that the rapture will happen, make sure that it’s
after your own death so people can’t call you out on it. Besides, Jo had
the stoploss on the prophecy that said he didn’t know exactly what 1890
or 91 meant, whether it was the millennium or if that’s when he would
die and see Jesus’ face, but he knows that the millennium will not
happen any sooner than that time. This is a prophecy you expect from
somebody who knows they’re lying. At least throughout everything William
Miller did, he actually believed what he was saying because he thought
he’d decoded the Bible using bible math and that it revealed a definite
time for the second coming. Jo was always a charlatan, even when some of
his contemporary competitors were honest.

Besides, how does somebody reconcile with this prophecy the fact that Jo
claimed to have seen the face of the Son of Man multiple times? It says
if he lives to 85 he would see the face of the Son of Man. When this was
recorded he’d long since fabricated the sacred grove story where he
supposedly saw god and the son of man face to face. He’d also seen Jesus
during the Kirtland Temple dedication ceremony and various times in the
School of the Prophets. Did Jo having already seen Jesus multiple times
just kind of slip his mind when he was dictating this?

Like I said before, the deeper you dig into this revelation, the harder
it is to reconcile with Mormon theology and history.

The next verses simply claim that whatever knowledge and intelligence is
gained on earth will ascend with a person into the afterlife…. When we
all become gods and are omniscient so the knowledge we gain here
actually won’t matter because we’ll all know everything there is to know
in the universe. So, that can’t be reconciled either.

Section 130 concludes with saying that god and Jesus have bodies of
flesh and bones as tangible as man’s, but that the Holy Ghost doesn’t,
he’s just a spooky ghost. Those last 2 verses are what a lot of
theologians have been dwelling on for quite some time. Not only did D\&C
130 contain all these prophecies, but it also included this fact that
god and Jesus are corporeal, thus settling once and for all the
19<sup>th</sup>-century debate about whether or not god has a body.
Sure, it’s interesting but it’s nowhere near the most interesting point
to focus on in the whole section.

However, what’s REALLY interesting in all of this is that there’s a day
break between the dictations. Verses 21-23 were given the day after the
rest of 130. Remember the setting in which this was dictated. Jo and
Orson L’Chydem are hanging out at Jo’s sister, Sophronia’s, house in
Ramus, Illinois. Orson had just given a sermon and this section was Jo’s
correction to what Orson had said. Do you want to hear what else Jo said
at this time that just didn’t happen to make it into the canonized
revelation? I think you’ll all really like these few points.

First Jo repeated his dream of the old silver-haired man that told Jo to
gather his armies. Orson interpreted the dream as such:

> “The Old man represents the Government of the United States, who will
> be invaded by a foreign foe, probably England. The United States
> government will call on the Saints to defend probably all this Western
> Territory, and will offer their leader any amount of men he shall
> desire, and put them under his command for that purpose.”

Because if Jo wasn’t dreaming about being the theocratic king to save
the world, he wasn’t in his right mind. But here is a passage I really
loved.

You’ve all heard that Joseph Smith said that quakers live on the moon,
or people that look like quakers, but what about all the animals, how
did they get here?

> I read the fifth chapter of Revelations, referring particularly to the
> sixth verse, showing from that, the actual existence of beasts in
> heaven; probably those were beasts which had lived on another planet,
> and not ours. God never made use of the figure of a beast to represent
> the kingdom of heaven: when it is made use of, it is to represent an
> apostate church. Beast \[with\] 7 eyes \[is the\] priesthood. This is
> the first time I have ever taken a text in Revelations, and if the
> young elders would let such things alone, it would be far better.

So, yes, Joseph Smith believed that quakers lived on the moon and that
animals are just aliens from different planets. That’s something I’ve
never seen in exmormon circles before. Jo thought that animals are
aliens, at least the beasts in the book of Revelation, and also claimed
the 7-eyed beast is the priesthood, whatever that means. He also claimed
that God is an alien and he lives on a planet that looks like a seer
stone made of crystallized glass and fire.

What I find so fascinating with this entire Millerite and Josephite
comparison is what it reveals about these two competing religious
leaders. I cut it from the show notes, but Orson Hyde preached in his
sermon that other sectarians out there are like crows feeding on
carrion. He applied the carrion to the Mormons who had left the church
but then says if he offers crows fresh meat they won’t take it as they
don’t have an appetite, the fresh meat, of course, representing the most
stalwart of members in the church. He uses it to claim that Miller and
other sectarians can only pick off the weakest of Mormons to get them to
convert to their religion, and the Mormons don’t want those people
anyway because they’re rotting old meat, not fresh like the more
faithful of the bunch.

Say what you want about William Miller, he was an interesting guy, he
made a lot of predictions and spawned nearly a dozen religions. His
health codes pervaded later 19<sup>th</sup>-century American religious
movements and likely had some influence on the Mormon health code. But
through all of his ministry, Miller sincerely believed what he claimed.
Nobody was more disappointed in the great disappointment of October 1844
than Miller himself.

Joseph Smith, on the other hand, was a charlatan from beginning to end.
He knew he was lying and that God didn’t speak to him the way most
people thought when Jo would claim that such was the case. He knew he’d
have to answer to false prophecies so he gave very few genuine
prophecies and most of them had a way he could get out from under them
if they turned out not to be true. He prophesied there would be a temple
built in Independence, Missouri before his generation passed away. He
prophesied that in 1891 Jesus would come back or the millennium would
start, or something like that, but it didn’t happen and he’d been dead
for 40 years so nobody could fact check him anymore.

Once again, Jo was many things, a moron is not one of them. He knew what
he was doing all along, and this comparison reveals that to be the case.
There are two articles you’ll find linked in the show notes. The first
is written by Robert Bowman Jr. in 2011 titled Joseph Smith, William
Miller, and Prophetic Speculation, published on Mormons in Transition.
The other is from the 1987 edition of the John Whitmer Journal by Grant
Underwood titled Apocalyptic Adversaries: Mormonism Meets Millerism.
Both articles are incredibly fascinating to put the two contemporaries
in proper context and compare them. The Underwood article, “Apocalyptic
Adversaries,” I find to be really important in understanding this
context, it even reveals some inner conflict among the Millerites
concerning the second coming, much like there was constant conflict in
Joseph’s Mormonism. I would encourage anybody seeking better
understanding of this issue to chase these two links down in the show
notes. There’s also a BYU studies article I’ll link in the show notes,
but it’s theology, not history, so do with it what you will.

Like I said, the entire article is fascinating and it draws many
parallels to Nauvoo Mormonism which I find even more fascinating because
they were contemporaries with some interaction. All in all, this is a
fascinating subject in comparative religious studies.

And that’s kind of the entire point of studying Mormon history, isn’t
it? What do I mean by that?... Joseph Smith is remarkable, when he’s
examined in isolation of the world around him. When you look at
contemporary events, other religious leaders around the same time, some
of them even coming out of the burned-over district like Jo did, his
remarkable teachings and revolutionary ideas fade into the mass of crazy
religious zealots that were his competitors. When did the Mormon church
become a business? It was always a business from day one. That alone can
explain some of Jo’s charisma. He always needed to ratchet up the crazy
to lift himself into prominence above his competitors. That’s not
somebody who’s lead by god, those are markers of a person led by selfish
motivations seeking ever increasing power and prominence in society. Jo
wanted notoriety and because he had thousands of sycophants fawning over
his every word; he gained the infamy he endlessly sought through
deception and criminality. At least examples like William Miller can be
used to prove that Jo was smart and deceptive. He lied to everyone every
day of his life. He also never gave a prophecy concerning events out of
his control that ever came true. What is a prophet who gives false
prophecies? A liar. What is any prophet even if they do give prophecies
that happen to come true? Still a liar. As a final point, don’t fall
victim to the same pitfalls as apologists or historians the way D.
Michael Quinn did. Science and religion are fundamentally different
things. Scientific predictions and prophecies are categorically
different things. What is a scientist who makes an inaccurate
prediction? A scientist. Because failed predictions fall by the wayside
until true predictions can be used to construct models. Prophecy doesn’t
have a self-correcting mechanism. Show me one prophecy you claim Joseph
Smith got right and I’ll show you just how wrong you are. Now you can
say that to your believing loved ones when they can’t stop talking about
how great a prophet this guy supposedly was.

It's our last installment of Ground Gnomes Give for Brother Jake. To
catch everybody up, Brother Jake suffered a cardiac event in December of
last year and he’s on the road to recovery and apparently doing really
well. The post Mormon community raised over $30,000 for the Frost family
to help with medical expenses which is just remarkable. So, to all the
podcasters, bloggers, and facebook sharers that made that possible,
thank you. We have one final treasure dig to do in order to thank
listeners of this show who donated, even if it does take this episode
from the category of long to ridiculously long. I’m sorry we’re so over
time, the research for this episode just kept giving. Chris and Kristy
McRoberts and Andrew Lindeman will be the focus of today’s treasure dig
and you’ll be receiving your likeness drawn into the treasure dig by
Mark Elwood of theglasslooker.com within the next couple of days. Thank
you for donating to help Brother Jake. And with this, I hope you’ll all
join me in wishing Jake Frost a speedy and healthy recovery. Get better,
man. Please enjoy:

Three weeks. Three weeks he’s been tracking this chest. The guardian
spirits are strong with this one, Andrew thinks to himself. It was
finally time he had to resort to extreme measures, but is this the
answer he seeks?

Andrew had heard far and wide that this conjurer is unrivaled, nearly
mythical, but he’d never had the leverage to bring it in for his own
dig… until now. Conjurers like this come at a premium. This conjurer
couldn’t be bothered to lift a finger unless there was incentive and the
real possibility that this dig would be a success. (nighttime forest
faint bg)

Andrew had received word that they would meet at his dig site. It was a
cool autumn night and the skies revealed a cosmos only made less
stunning by the prominence of a full moon between small breaks in the
tree line. It will be a fortuitous night if all pieces fall in their
place. After three weeks of digging, the hole had to be 27 feet deep by
now. If the treasure wasn’t revealed within the next 7 feet of digging,
the earth would never give up what it conceals. After walking through
the woods for what seemed like ages, Andrew finally arrived at the
clearing with his dig site. Each point of the circle staked by hazel
rods, he’d done everything perfectly to satisfy the guardian spirits.
He’d been led to this point by his guide and his guide had never
failed him yet.

Andrew stands at the edge of the hole, sure to not enter the sacred
space before invoking a protection spell. All is quiet. An uneasy
feeling begins to invade Andrew’s mind. He doesn’t know from whence the
feeling comes, but he’s never felt this before. A presence is nearby.

A slow fog begins to creep from out of the forest toward him. (some
windy foggy noise) This feeling of uneasiness only grows in power.
Andrew feels nearly unable to speak, what is happening? The fog
continues to thicken and grow. He can barely see the sacred ground
before him, let alone the tree line in the distance.

“You must be Andrew.” Whispers a voice from the darkness and
fog-shrouded forest. Andrew can’t divine from whence the voice came.

“Who’s there?” Andrew says, unable to hold his tongue before he can
compose himself. He’s afraid and apprehensive, but he knows this is the
right path.

“We are Christus. Have you an offering?” The voice is neither male nor
female, but somehow both. Andrew, not sure what to expect, digs into his
pocket. He feels around briefly, pushes his talisman aside, and finds
the small bag. He pulls it out, slightly opening the top to reveal the
white powder contents, then holds it in his hand outstretched into the
fog. Will Christus emerge? Will it finally reveal itself? Will he
finally see this mythical conjurer and understand why it strikes fear
into the hearts of men?

“That will do.” Christus says. The fog begins to lift. (end windy foggy
noise) Andrew’s eyes are peering deeply into the cloud and darkness, but
he can’t make anything out just yet. Still with an outstretched hand
holding his offering, Andrew begins to see two separate and distinct
personages saunter from the woods towards him. They adorn heavy cloaks
with hoods that cast a shadow over their faces, shielding them from the
moonlight. Andrew doesn’t know what to expect, but this must be the
conjurer he’s heard rumors of. But… two personages? This was certainly
striking, he’d never known two conjurers to be referred to as one
before. All conjurers he’s worked with have been lone wolves. Andrew
wonders to himself, does having two make their conjurations more
powerful?

The two figures approach him. “I am Chris” says one hooded figure. “I am
Kristy” says the other in the same nonchalant tone of voice. “Together
we are Christus. What is this?”

“This is a sign and token of fellowship.” Andrew replies.

“Has it a name?” Chris asks.

“It has.” Andrew says, knowing the proper form of such procedures.

“Will you give it to me?” Kristy asks.

“I will on the other side of the veil.” Andrews says, concluding the
opening pleasantries.

“Have you your amethyst to prevent inebriation?” Chris asks, knowing the
spirits shall infect the group’s mental faculties upon suffumigation.

Andrew nods in affirmation.

Kristy turned her head to the east, Chris to the west. Kristy took a
small crystal and vial of oil from her pocket and drew a cross on the
crystal with the oil. “I beseech thee, my Lady St. Helen, mother of King
Constantine, which didst find the cross whereupon Christ died; by that
holy devotion and invention of the cross, and by the same cross, and by
the joy which thou conceivedst at the finding thereof, and by the love
which thou bearest to thy son Constantine, and by the great goodness
which thou dost always use; that thou shew me in this crystal whatsoever
I ask, or desire to know, Amen.”

“Sorry, we must always be certain.” Kristy says as she turns the crystal
to show Andrew. The cross is glowing white, emitting the faintest of
sounds that are pleasing to the ear. (glowing crystally sound)

“Had it revealed an impure countenance, what would you have done?”
Andrew asks with some reservation.

Christus both look at Andrew just enough for the moonlight to reveal
smiling eyes beneath their hoods. Chris removes from his cloak a thin
wooden wand, stark white in color. With the other hand he grasps a small
metal talisman with a concave indent on top. He uses this talisman to
remove some of the mysterious white powder from the bag in Andrew’s
hand. “Omnis Spiritus Laudet Dominum” and the very tip of the wand
ignited in a blue flame. (burning torch sfx) “Mosen habent yi prophetas”
Chris quietly chants as he runs the flame over the white powder in the
talisman. The powder ignites (gunpowder or magnesium ignition sfx) and
is instantly consumed into a cloud of white smoke that envelopes all
three treasure diggers. As quickly as the smoke formed, the slight
autumn breeze whisks it away. “We are ready, only silence will rule the
night until the conjuration is complete.” Kristy took the small bag of
powder from Andrew as payment.

The smoke had smudged away all impurities and now it was time to begin.
Andrew stepped to the far end of his treasure dig hole and picked up his
shovel. He thought to himself, “It better work this time. It was hard to
come by that offering.” He slipped down the edge of the hole to the
bottom while Christus stood on east and west of the hole, shrouded in
darkness. Andrew can feel that this time is different. The soil under
his feet seems to be transferring energy through his sandals up through
his body and out the crown of his skull. The spirits are close.

Andrew pierces the soil with the blade of his shovel, (shovel into soil
sfx) not sure what to expect. But…. Nothing. Nothing is happening. He
can feel the energy roundabout; the treasure must be close. He lifts out
the first shovel full and pitches the earth to the north. He takes
another stab with his shovel and tosses the earth to the south. (a few
more shovel sfx) Each successive shovelful is thrown in the cardinal
direction, digging deeper with every toss. (bg humming noise that slowly
grows louder) Andrew keeps striking the soil, but every shovel just
brings forth more earth. However, he feels the power growing. He’s been
fighting this guardian spirit for 3 weeks now, he knows its presence and
it does not like that these conjurers are present to assist Andrew in
acquiring their treasure. He keeps shoveling. More and more dirt.
Nothing but dirt. He’s done everything right\! How can the treasure not
be bound? (humming even louder) (shovel hits metal) Wait. Could this be
it?

Christus stare down at Andrew from the rim of the hole and he returns
their gaze in excitement. All he can see of their hooded faces is two
bright grins illuminated by the moonlight. Have they succeeded? Andrew
can see the moon glinting off some metal from where his shovel just hit.
The treasure is so close. But the spirit is very unpleased. Andrew looks
up to Christus and tries to tell them he has the treasure, but his
tongue is bound in his mouth. He can’t speak. He tries to mutter words,
but his throat feels like it’s bound by chords.

“No. Why? Why now? We can’t let the spirit win\!” Andrew shouts in his
mind. He’s worked so hard, it can’t end like this. He lifts his shovel
high into the air to plunge it deep into the earth beside the chest. He
brings the edge down with crushing force. Just as the tip of his shovel
collides with the earth it shatters into a thousand pieces. (metallic
explosion sound… that’s a thing, right?)

“FLEE\! The spirit will reduce you to atoms if you don’t flee now\!”
Andrew looks up to Christus but where they used to stand at the edge of
the hole only remains pillars of white smoke. The treasure chest begins
to glow an eerie orange color. Andrew kneels down to grab it with his
hands but he’s instantly burned (sizzle) by the edges he can touch.
Andrew knows, the spirit is furious and if he remains, he shall surely
die. The treasure begins to glow brighter and brighter. (Different but
really loud humming noise as treasure heats up) Christus knows best.
Andrew turns to flee from the bottom of the pit and scrambles up the

sfx with glowy ringy noise) (some kind of otherworldly explosion noise)
Andrew gets out just in time as the entire pit turns into white light.
He lays on his back outside the pit, winded, having just escaped being
vaporized by the guardian spirit. Andrew slowly rises to see what damage
had been wreaked upon his treasure dig spot. Each of the twelve hazel
sticks outside the pit are on fire. He stands up and looks down into the
hole. What used to be a pit of dirt remains a thin pane of opaque glass
with the treasure chest locked securely beneath.

Andrew looks around to see what happened to Christus, but they’re
nowhere to be found. Conjurers like them haven’t lasted this long
without fleeing every dig at the first sign of trouble. Andrew barely
escaped with his life intact, and maybe that’s the only treasure the
diggers can hope for.

And that wraps up our treasure digging fundraiser for Brother Jake. Once
again, huge thanks to everybody from this awesome community of Post
Mormons who donated to help the Frost family in their time of need. Huge
thanks to Brian and Annie for their help with the vocal and another huge
thanks to Mark Elwood of theglasslooker.com for illustrating our
participants’ likeness into these treasure digs. Be sure to check out
his website in the show notes and get amped for his graphic novel of
Joseph Smith’s treasure digs that’s currently in progress.

Just a little house cleaning before wrapping up the show tonight, I know
this episode has gone really long, I’m sorry about that.

Posted episode to the wrong feed.
