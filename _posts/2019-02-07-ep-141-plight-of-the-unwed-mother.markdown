Ep 141 – Plight of the Unwed Mother

On this episode, I bother all of you with a Facebook fight. Yes, really.
Don’t worry, it’s just to springboard into the controversial issue of
abortion in Nauvoo Mormonism. We read through a court document from
March 1843 of a woman who suffered abuse at the hands of a Thomsonian
herbal physician after he gave her ergot and injected cayenne pepper
into her veins. Then we opine on the plight of women in
19<sup>th</sup>-century America. The outro includes a brief conversation
with Kimberly Anderson, the featured guest of our next NaMo Home
Evening\!

Where are all the children of polygamous marriages in Nauvoo? Brigham
Young had 56 wives in Utah and nearly as many children, but with
polygamy being practiced in Nauvoo, wouldn’t we expect to see some
children as a result? I’ve dealt with this on the show repeatedly
because I think a very simple answer exists, but a lot of people are
blocked from accessing that answer.

Back in November I tangled with a few people in the Mormon historians
facebook group on the subject. A person asked the simple question: “Is
there any evidence that Joseph Smith fathered children with anyone other
than Emma? I’ve heard contradictory things.”

15 different comment threads all opined on the fact that DNA studies
have been inconclusive, a few women claimed to have Joseph’s children,
but it can’t be proven, and a few other points. Another central point of
discussion was that if he didn’t have children with any of his wives
then either the marriages didn’t include sex, or they didn’t happen
altogether and that Nauvoo polygamy was a result of a propaganda
campaign by Brigham Young. A lot of people hold to that last point, but
it’s old scholarship mostly coming out of the RLDS who thought Joseph
fought polygamy. It’s nonsense. So then, the question remains, is there
any evidence that Joseph Smith fathered children with anyone other than
Emma? After seeing all these comments I decided to chime in with this:
“Is the topic of abortion completely off the table in this comment
thread? It sure would explain the lack of progeny and comport with
multiple testimonies and interviews that claimed it was happening.”

My comment continued a little further with talking about Sarah Pratt and
her being controversial, but ended with “Are there any solid arguments
against the \[multiple\] claims of abortions? Please educate me.”

I know, I’m sitting here on a podcast talking about a facebook argument
I had, I’m the worst kind of podcaster. But I promise this is driving at
a point, so please lend me your ears for a moment as I meander my way
there.

A few people chimed in. The argument posed against abortions taking
place in Nauvoo first came from a person commenting on the general ages
and marital status of his wives. If Joseph was having sexual relations
with his wives who were already married, it wouldn’t be necessary to
cause them to have abortions as they could raise the children with their
first husbands and nobody would be any the wiser. Of course, John C.
Bennett was a focus of the conversation and that after Wreck-it Bennett
left the majority of Jo’s new marriages were younger and unmarried
women, which would make it much more challenging to hide resulting
children. If Bennett was performing abortions, we would expect it to be
flipped, that Jo took younger girls while Bennett was around so he could
cause them to have abortions, then when Bennett left the church Jo took
older already married women as his abortionist-in-chief was no longer
there to perform abortions and conceal the inevitable results of these
affairs. Because this discrepancy in a simplistic timeline, a few people
chiming in said they simply couldn’t buy it, not adding the subtle
undertone that I read into their statements of “because the prophet
would never kill a baby\!”

This timeline discrepancy poses absolutely no issue for the plausibility
of Bennett, or any other physicians in Nauvoo performing abortions at
the time. I stated that I’m of the opinion that it wasn’t black or
white. That if a child could be raised by another couple as their own
then we would expect to see DNA evidence of that emerge at some point,
but nothing conclusive has yet. However, I’m also of the opinion that Jo
was motivated by self-preservation, and if a pregnancy couldn’t be
explained without pointing a finger at the prophet, he would do whatever
necessary to keep his public persona intact. A person asked for some
resources on abortions in the mid 19<sup>th</sup>-century, to which I
replied with a Women’s Health journal 1979 publication which detailed
exactly what the person was looking for, then they understandably
ghosted the conversation.

However, after this exchange had been happening for a while, Will Bagley
chimed in. Will Bagley has been on this show talking about his book,
Blood of the Prophets, and within the Mormon historians group he’s been
lovingly dubbed as a strong shot of whiskey that’ll burn going down and
probably set your hair on fire when he absolutely destroyed somebody who
was being quite disrespectful in the group. If you’ve read Blood of the
Prophets or any of Bagley’s Utah history books you know how fitting a
description this is. Bagley chimed into the thread saying, “why else
invite abortionist and General Bennett into the First Presidency? I
mean—in addition to the masonic motivations.” It seems Bagley doesn’t
have any issue with abortions being performed in Nauvoo to conceal
polygyny. Somebody chimed in under his comment asking if there’s a
specific woman we thought had an abortion of Joseph’s child. The person
simply asked for evidence, which is hard to come by on this subject.

My response was as follows, and once again, I promise this is driving to
a point, I’m not just talking about a facebook argument for the fun of
it.

> That's a really good question and I wish I knew more about the topic

> I'm sorry I don't have a better answer than that.

The thread went dark after that comment. I think it’s important that the
multiple allegations of abortion taking place in Nauvoo be corroborated
by documentary evidence beyond contemporary testimonies by Sarah Pratt,
Hyrum Smith, and a few others, as well as later accounts by Sarah Pratt
and Lucinda Morgan Harris that we’ve discussed on this show. Well, the
point to telling all of you about this facebook fiasco is to tell you
that I may have found something noteworthy that provides exactly the
documentary evidence required to substantiate the possibility that
abortions were happening in Nauvoo, which will be the focus of our
episode today.

A few points to preface this conversation. First, why is this important?
Whether or not Joseph Smith was sexually intimate with at least some of
his wives is a subject of considerable debate in the field of Nauvoo
history. Why? Well, it casts his motivations into question. Believe it
or not, many of Jo’s biographers think that sexual intimacy in his
polygamous marriages was a rare phenomenon, not a general theme. Some of
his biographers think he never had sexual relations with these women and
that he was only getting married to them to begrudgingly fulfill the
commandment given to him by God. That’s just what we should expect when
the majority of his biographers view him as a pious prophet who
literally spoke as the mouthpiece of God. If Jo never wanted to have
multiple wives, but God commanded him to do so, he was merely fulfilling
the commandments of god the way biblical prophets did. However, once his
personal desires and libido are factored into the equation it leads to
some crucial questions. If Jo wanted to have sexual intimacy with
multiple women, then how can we be sure that the commandment actually
came from God; that Jo was acting as a prophet and not a man when he
said the men should take multiple wives in order to reach the highest
kingdom of the celestial kingdom? Now, if you’re listening to this show,
I’d be willing to bet that this isn’t a personal issue with you, dear
listener. You probably view Jo similar to the way I do, a despot with an
ever-increasing greed for wealth and power who viewed women as a
commodity. But, if we can’t find common ground in this conversation
about sexual dynamics in Nauvoo polygamy, we’re talking past each other,
so we need to understand where everybody’s coming from. I’m personally
of the opinion that Jo probably had far more sexual partners than his
wife-count reveals, but that’s only speculation so we can leave it aside
for today.

Second point to preface this discussion: This shouldn’t be an issue. If
you want to have multiple sexual partners, then have multiple sexual
partners. It’s not hard. Make sure everybody involved are informed,
consenting adults and then have the time of your life. Your sexuality,
sexual desires, gender identity, have absolutely no bearing on who you
are, or your value to society. That’s just an unequivocally true
statement. The way a person acts on those sexual desires is how they
affect others and where we should cast judgement. If a person engages in
sexual activity with somebody who isn’t consenting, isn’t informed, or
isn’t an adult, that’s cause for judgement from other people. That’s how
a person’s sexuality affects their personality. Informed, consenting
adults. Those are the criteria. Check those boxes, then everybody’s on
the up-and-up and have a good time while being safe.

Point number three: This conversation can never be couched in a way
that’s fair to everybody involved. What I mean by that is these
conversations always center on whether or not Joseph Smith had sex with
his wives. By definition, these conversations rarely take into account
the women’s perspective in it. Society has simply never been truly equal
for men and women. There was absolutely no fairness among sexes in
19<sup>th</sup>-century America. Any social barriers experienced by
women and gender minorities today were inconceivably worse in the time
period this podcast studies. We could never understand the plight of
women in early Mormonism. Unfortunately, this conversation suffers from
many of the biases of the field of Mormon history, which suffers from
the biases of the time in which it occurred. It’s very tough to overcome
these male-centric biases.

Which leads perfectly into point number four: parsing out informed and
consenting in these relationships is a bucket of monkeys. Multiple
polygamous relationships in Nauvoo were with women many years before
adulthood, which is utterly reprehensible. The marriages involving adult
women were only agreed upon with a social structure and power dynamic
that is terribly complicated. That’s not to say that a woman was
incapable of being informed and consenting to these relationships. What
I’m saying is, when you have one guy who’s the ultimate religious and
government authority with his own army and shadow enforcement squad and
you become one of his marks, there really wasn’t much a woman could do.
There could have been some women like Eliza Snow and Elizabeth Ann
Whitney who openly consented to being Jo’s clandestine polygamous wives,
who knew the extent of his relationships, informed consenting adults may
have all been checked in a few of these relationships. However, at the
end of the day, Joseph Smith was still the prophet of God and the
highest-ranking government authority in Nauvoo. He was the gatekeeper to
the kingdom of heaven and it often became the case that the key to
unlock that kingdom for you and your whole family was by giving in to
the coercion and becoming his next wife. Informed and consenting simply
cannot be achieved with this social structure. I would also point out
that nearly every despotic alpha-male empire builder like Joseph Smith
treated women as a commodity to be collected and added to his personal
wealth. Joseph Smith fits many patterns exhibited by the most
objectively immoral people in human history in this regard. I’ll just
say again, if you want to have multiple sexual partners, go ahead,
there’s nothing stopping you and that has no bearing on how good or
bad of a person you are. The way you acquire those relationships is what
casts your character into question. Also, if you’re a Puritanical
religious leader crusading against immorality and you consider sex
outside of marriage immoral, and then go on to have multiple sexual
relations outside marriage, that makes you a hypocrite and a liar and
nobody should trust anything you say about anything in the world.

And, the fifth and final point to preface this conversation: It’s very
likely that the women had absolutely no choice in whether or not to have
these abortions, let alone the sexual intimacy in the first place. If a
woman who was coerced into these polygamous marriages began to show with
child, it could tarnish the reputation of the prophet and his most
trusted polygamous acolytes, which they wouldn’t allow to happen. The
woman’s desires and well-being likely never factored into the
decision-making process, which is unequivocally and objectively wrong.
Abortion, and the larger point of women’s health, is often a hot-button
issue today, but it may surprise some of you to learn that women have
been aborting their children for justifiable reasons for just as long as
physicians have been around, which is to say probably longer than we
have written evidence of. The last century has brought a lot of
scientific advancements which have rendered these procedures much safer
and much less painful. We happen to live in a day and age where women’s
health is better than it has ever been, but that’s only come as a result
of constant advocating and fighting, largely by disenfranchised women,
to acquire those advancements. And, most importantly, the fight is never
over. Elections have consequences, people.

This entire issue is a thorny one with a lot of angles to consider. When
we’re talking about the real-world effects of polygamy within the ranks
of the criminal empire of Nauvoo Mormonism, this subject is important
and the willful ignorance exhibited by people who don’t want to deal
with the issue renders the historical record incomplete, biased, and
unfair.

I’m going to do my best to navigate polygamy and abortions fairly today
as I always try to do when these issues are the focus of an episode.
Hopefully I’ve made my personal biases clear with these preface points.
Now, on to the documentary evidence that abortions were happening in
Nauvoo.

This evidence comes as a result of a court proceeding, chaired by Joseph
Smith as mayor of Nauvoo, in March 1843. The underlying details of this
hearing are a bit vague. This evidence does not conclude that Joseph
Smith himself was causing his polygamous wives to have abortions, I
doubt that documentary evidence was ever created in the first place, let
alone preserved 175 years later, but it does exhibit that people other
than John C. Wreck-it Bennett were capable of performing abortions and
that they did take place even after his departure.

Before reading the actual document, I want to place a trigger warning
here. This is a completely unabashed take on women’s health in the
19<sup>th</sup>-century and what this woman suffered is horrendous.
Let’s get into it.

This trial was cut from the History of the Church during is compilation
phase. Since I’m reading the Dan Vogel version of the History of the
Church, it has been restored from the original document, which was
initially published in the Wasp of 22 March 1843. You’ll find the
original handwritten document in the show notes.

The facts of the case are as follows: Margaret Kennedy Lusk Dana was
pregnant and very close to giving birth. A physician named William
Bicking Brink attended to her after she complained of fever or diarrhea.
The physician, Brink, decided her child was ill and that an abortion
needed to be performed, which he did against Magaret Dana’s will.
Because she was a woman and couldn’t testify against a physician in
court, her husband, Charles Dana, filed a complaint on her behalf for
malpractice with the municipal Court of Nauvoo. The plaintiff sought
damages of $99.00 for malfeasance and misfeasance in her treatment.

We’ll be taking a couple detours while we read through this, but the
details of this case are fascinating, and I hope to share with you why
that is as we go through it.

The initial complain is as follows:

> This is an action of assumpsit commenced by summons, and brought by
> the plaintiff to recover damages, as he avers in his bill of
> particulars, sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the defendant’s
> failing to perform his undertakings as physician, in a usual and
> skillful manner, which he had undertaken by his employment and his
> engagement in attending as such physician, the wife of the plaintiff
> in the city of Nauvoo, in the year 1842, to do. $99.00
> 
> Also, for damage sustained from the malfeasance and misfeasance of the
> defendant in the treatment of the plaintiff’s wife, while employed as
> physician by the plaintiff to attend his said wife at Nauvoo in 1842;
> contrary to the defendant’s undertaking as such physician, by reason
> of which bad acts and treatment of the defendant to plaintiff’s said
> wife, in the premises, plaintiff’s said wife is greatly injured in her
> health and put to lasting pain and suffering; and the plaintiff has
> thereby lost the services, company and comfort of his said wife, since
> said bad treatment of defendant; and been put to pain, trouble,
> expense and anxiety, not only from the present loss of his said wife’s
> health, but also from well grounded apprehensions of the fatal
> consequences of the injury done to his said wife, by said defendant,
> in the premises, to his damage. $99.00

Once the charges were presented, Dr. Brink’s counsel raised an objection
to them, claiming that different schools of physicians were arrayed
against each other. This is an interesting point that is true, which
we’ll get into momentarily. The counsel then argued that they would
need to call in expert witnesses, other physicians, once the witnesses
had testified, to determine if any malpractice had actually occurred.
The witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff were called to the stand to
state what Dr. Brink had done which could be perceived as malpractice.

What did the counsel mean by that? Well, medicine and midwifery were
hotly disputed in the early 1800s. Dr. Brink was a Thomsonian herbal
physician and had administered a controversial medicine to Mrs. Dana
during his visit, which we’ll get to, but prior to the early 1800s,
midwifery and physicians tended to stay in their lane. However, in the
1810s and 20s physicians began to take more of a role in the childbirth
process. Thomson himself notes this in his book, lamenting how midwifery
used to be handled exclusively by females with great success and
relatively cheap, but then physicians came in and ruined everything and
began charging a bunch of money for their services. His final line I
quote here seems almost prophetic

From the 1831 edition of New Guide to Health, or, Botanic Family
Physician, written by Samuel Thomson p. 130

> The practice of midwifery at this time, appears to be altogether a
> matter of speculation with the medical faculty, by their exorbitant

Weird, it turns out when women were caring for other women during
childbirth that the success rates were higher and injury was less
common. Then the dudes come in and begin charging exorbitant fees,
inflicting permanent harm, and cause higher rates of infant mortality.
I’ll be reading a bit more from a later edition of Thomson’s herbal
medicine once we read a few of the witness statements.

> Mrs. Miles: Was at plaintiff’s house on Saturday, the 22<sup>nd</sup>
> of October, 1842, when Dr. Brink, the defendant, was called to
> administer to plaintiff’s wife, in a case of fever or diarrhea; this

> urged him to quit; said he was hurrying her too fast; witness proposed

Another witness was called to the stand who was called after the first
day of medicine was administered by Dr. Brink. This witness, Mrs. Duel,
says:

> When witness came, Mrs. Dana was in considerable distress; defendant
> thought she was ready for parturition, and would be delivered by three
> pains more. Defendant resorted to unusual means. Witness remonstrated
> against his course, to let nature have time; while Mrs. Dana screamed,

> be turned before it could be born; that it was necessary to keep up
> irritation in order to create pains and hasten delivery. Witness
> proposed to have some one else called. Defendant opposed it, but
> finally consented.

After Mrs. Duel’s witness statement, Sylvia Sessions was called to the
stand as she had been called in by Dr. Brink to help him deliver the
child. According to Mrs. Sessions, Dr. Brink noted how small her hands
were and that he needed her small hands to turn the child in order to
deliver it. Apparently his hands were too large to perform the
procedure. Sessions delivered the premature child who died soon after
its birth. The childbirth nearly killed Mrs. Dana. Next to the stand was
Mrs. Dana herself, to which the defendant’s counsel objected because
husband and wife were considered one legal entity and Mr. Dana had
already made the complaint. The objection was overruled and Mrs. Dana
took the stand.

So, if you were within a few weeks of giving birth and you happened to
call a physician for fever, it could easily become a death sentence. And
people wonder why women turn to alternative medicine when this is the
way the world of medicine has historically treated them. My partner,
Annie, has been watching a Netflix series lately, Call the Midwife,
which tackles these issues head on. The few episodes I’ve seen have been
horrific and informative of the sphere of women’s health just a century
after the time period we’re discussing on the show here.

To the claims made in the witness statements, it seems as if Mrs. Dana
did just that, was suffering from fever and called a Thomsonian
physician to administer herbal remedies. Dr. Brink came into her house,
told her the baby was ready to come and that it was dead, gave her ergot
to hasten her labor, which I’ll discuss in a second here, injected an
ointment of cayenne pepper directly to her bloodstream repeatedly, then
tried to turn her baby, which he thought was dead, to get it into
birthing position, possibly even before the baby had reached the
quickening phase, and then inserted his hand into her vagina to manually
turn the baby, while applying pressure on her abdomen to force the child
out, all of this while her child was still 4 weeks early. Dr. Brink
thought the amnion fluid had discharged, but it turns out that was just
blood from the injuries he’d caused her. Finally, Mrs. Session was
called in with her expertise and small hands and she delivered the
premature child who died soon after. It’s likely that Sessions’ presence
saved the life of Mrs. Dana. Had she been left solely in the care of Dr.
Brink it wouldn’t be hard to conclude that she likely would have died in
his care.

So those are the facts according to witnesses. Now it was left to the
court to determine if it rose to the level of malpractice or
malfeasance. For that purpose, they called Drs. Bennett, Weld, Foster,
and Higbee to the stand, who stated:

> That defendant’s treatment to Mrs. Dana was unusual and uncalled for,
> and had they operated in like manner it would be unjustifiable, and
> that it was contrary to the general practice of physicians.

The court found the facts convincing and laid everything out before a
witness was called to the stand on behalf of the defendant.

> That Dr. Brink the defendant, was called to administer to Mrs. Dana,
> in a case of fever or diarrhea, and not for parturition:
> 
> That his doses of ergot, or something else, to hasten delivery; were

Let’s deal with the ergot for a minute. By the late 1700s, ergot had
been used in very light dosages by midwives for parturition, but that
was usually used only rarely in light doses, or after birth as a
coagulant to stop post partem bleeding. Into the early 1800s, America
and other Western countries were experiencing a shift in the field of
medicine. When local apothecaries and physicians were running wild in
the expanding frontier, the early 1800s saw the formation of multiple
medical societies to streamline and codify medical practices. This was a
mixed bag of results. On the one hand, small localities saw the
dwindling of folk medicine in lieu of larger mass-produced medicines
delivered in ready-made bottles. Local doctors foraging through the
forest and making potions lost business while larger conglomerates
produced hundreds or thousands of bottles of chemically similar potions
in factories. These medical societies frequently published journals on
the newest findings in medicine. They held large symposia where
physicians would get together and share their newest research, science
was being done on medicine and the medical world today largely owes the
miracles they perform on a daily basis to this shift in the early 1800s.
However, it also meant that some possibly more effective but less
profitable medicines fell by the wayside as massive companies like Bayer
began to flourish through mass-production and influence medical
practices worldwide.

Into this world a man named John Stearns was elected to the office of
Secretary of the Medical Society of New York, which published the *New
York Medical Repository* annual journal. Stearns was elected to his
position in 1807 and published an article the next year on the medical
properties of ergot in facilitating parturition. What used to be a folk
remedy in occult magic books was now cast into the light of modern
botanic physicians who began employing it frequently during childbirth
to hasten delivery. Two years later Stearns was elected a Senator of New
York where he continued to fiercely lobby on behalf of growing medical
establishments. His article, however, had ripple effects for years to
come.

Samuel Thomson, in his 1835 edition of the Botanic Family Physician,
devoted a few paragraphs to midwifery, and even weighed in on the
controversy of using ergot in childbirth. He even said that physicians
were good to keep around during the childbirth process, but not for the
reasons you’d think. He related a few stories where physicians attending
to women giving birth had done much more damage than good, much like
this Dr. Brink character in the Nauvoo court, and goes on to say that
midwives know best. This passage I’m reading begins with Thomson
relating a story of his attending to a woman after a very hard birth in
getting her healthy again. No, Thomson apparently didn’t interfere in
the birthing process itself, but used this as an example of how
physicians tend to ruin childbirth. He used this story to illustrate the
point that physicians should be there only to nurse women back to health
after birth.

In another case a few pages before what we just read, is where Thomson
weighed in on the use of ergot.

Let’s stay on this ergot train for a minute before getting back to the
1843 case of Dana vs. Brink. Ergot actually has a long history of being
used in childbirth prior to John Stearns writing about it in the New
York Medical Repository in 1808. It was first included in a botanic
physician’s book from Germany in 1582. It had been used by midwives
infrequently since then until it gained a resurgence in mainstream
medicine with the help of the John Stearns guy.

Ergot is some nasty stuff. It’s a fungus that grows on grains and turns
them black in appearance, even though the actual fruiting bodies
themselves are purple. Bread or beer made from these ergotized grains
carry with them the psychoactive effects of the ergot. Some historians
have hypothesized that ergot played a role in the Salem witch trials.
The convulsions and hallucinations experienced by the accused in the
trials can easily be explained by ergot as such happen to be symptoms of
ergot poisoning. People with ergot poisoning frequently experience
hallucinations, gangrenous loss of limbs, and finally death in high
enough doses. Beyond just the Salem witch trials, ergot may have even
played a role in the accusations of witchcraft during multiple
inquisitions in Europe. It’s nasty. It’s powerful. Farmers can pick it
out from a mile away in a field, its frequently called smut of whatever
grain it happens to be growing on. It can easily plague small patches or
even entire fields if conditions are just right, causing those crops to
be lost if dealt with responsibly, or consumed causing ergotism
outbreaks when not dealt with responsibly.

Moving forward from that, in the early 1930s, chemists across the world
were attempting to isolate the convulsive alkaloids in the fungus. The
Rockefeller Institute of New York first succeeded in isolating and
naming the common nucleus in ergot alkaloids, Lysergic Acid. Here, in
the late 1930s, enter Albert Hoffman in Switzerland. Hoffman was
studying lysergic acid and producing derivatives of it for the
pharmacology department of Sandoz in Basel. Through some complicated
chemistry I’m far from able to understand, Hoffman was finally able to
derive diethylamide from the lysergic acid, becoming the first person to
synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide, which he designated LSD-25.
Hoffman noted that the animals which were given the chemical exhibited
“restless\[ness\] during the narcosis.”

Five years later, at the end of his shift, Hoffman took his first hit of
acid. He recorded this in his journal “17:00 Beginning dizziness,
feeling of anxiety, visual distortions, symptoms of paralysis, desire to
laugh.” Then he hopped on his bike and rode home, asking his lab
assistant to accompany him to make sure he made it safe. This famous
bike ride has become a bit of an inciting incident in the psychedelics
movement. His journal of that day contains no more entries, but he did
record what happened the following Monday.

> “The dizziness and sensation of fainting became so strong at times
> that I could no longer hold myself erect, and had to lie down on a
> sofa. My surroundings had now transformed themselves in more
> terrifying ways. Everything in the room spun around, and the familiar
> objects and pieces of furniture assumed grotesque, threatening forms.
> They were in continuous motion, animated, as if driven by an inner
> restlessness. The lady next door, whom I scarcely recognized, brought
> me milk - in the course of the evening I drank more than two liters.
> She was no longer Mrs. R., but rather a malevolent, insidious witch
> with a colored mask."

So to trace this thought train all the way back to the station, LSD, or
acid as many people call it, was first synthesized from ergot, which is
what this Dr. Brink had administered to Mrs. Dana to induce her
premature birth. Yes, ergot is a poison, however, lysergic acid
diethylamide, acid, doesn’t contain the convulsive and necrotic
alkaloids that cause paralysis, limbs falling off, and death. Samuel
Thomson, the father of herbal medicine, was quite familiar with it and
said it ought to be guarded against in all cases, even though John
Stearns had advocated for its usage in hastening childbirth in 1808.
Ergot was a source of contention for many botanic physicians as it
undeniably holds medicinal properties, but the poisonous effects were
never reliably removed from it until the late 1930s when Albert Hoffman
produced LSD. Some kitchen chemists and botanic physicians had tried
manipulating it to reduce how toxic it is when Thomsonian medicine was
gaining traction, but the majority of people trying to use it had simply
plucked ergotized grains and made beer or cake with it in hopes it
wasn’t too potent to kill whoever happened to consume it.

I also want to add in to the mix a quick read from the Sunstone pamphlet
Cody and I handed out and presented on in 2017 on the Smith-entheogen
theory.

What I’m saying is Cody and I predicted nearly 2 years ago that ergot
may have played a role in early Mormonism, and in this court case we see
a Thomsonian physician administering it for parturition. I want to
clarify, just because I found ergot being used for medicinal purposes in
1843, that in no way proves that it was used for entheogenic purposes in
the early church. What it does prove, however, is that early Mormonism
contained a number of people who were familiar with its usage and knew
how to render it in such a way that it wouldn’t be poisonous enough to
kill a mother or child during birth, which exhibits a certain expertise
required to use it in a religious or entheogenic context. That old
canard comes into play from Parcelsus himself in the 1530s, “All things
are poisons, for there is nothing without poisonous qualities. It is
only the dose which makes a thing poison.” It’s the set and setting that
allows ergot to be versatile as an entheogen, a medicine to help women
give birth more quickly, or to cause death very quickly if that’s what
the botanist requires.

With that little rabbit hole explored, let’s resurface back to Dana vs.
Dr. Brink of Nauvoo 1843.

The summary of the case law is important here. The citation of the bible
is interesting, especially the old testament. Why I find it interesting
is because there’s literally abortion in the Bible, known as the
“Faithful Wife Test” in Numbers 5.

Yeah, it’s pretty horrible. It’s also worth noting that the floor of the
tabernacle was a threshing floor that was probably contaminated with
ergot, which causes it to become “water that brings a curse and causes
bitter suffering.” Kinda like gangrene, paralysis, convulsions, and
sometimes death. Ergot has probably been used as an abortifacient since
biblical times. It’s a good thing the bible doesn’t influence our laws
today or who knows what society might look like. Right?...

Back to the findings of the hearing; case law states, according to this
document, that abortion for medical purposes wasn’t illegal at the time.
A person could cause a child to die in utero and they weren’t held
legally liable for it. However, if the child died after birth as a
result of the conduct of the physician, they could be held liable for
murder.

It’s just worth considering the state of health care and childbirth in
the 1840s to put that into context. They didn’t have all the fancy
science and machines to keep children alive that we have today. A
troubled pregnancy could easily be terminated if an issue was suspected
with the child, but they didn’t exactly have in utero biopsies and
testing that could be performed to determine the health of an unborn
fetus. It could often be the case that a troublesome pregnancy, if not
terminated early, could only further endanger the life of the mother as
the fetus gestated. Terminating pregnancies was, and still is today, a
medically necessary procedure to preserve the life of the mother.

This case is quite revealing of the time. It’s a good thing she had a
husband she lived with and didn’t have to hide from society who could
sue Dr. Brink on her behalf. How would that have played out if she
didn’t have a husband? How would this have played out for her if this
Dr. Brink had abused her the way she did and her husband happened to be
in another state, or another country on a mission for the church? What
recourse would she have? 1839 in Mississippi saw the first Married
Woman’s Property Act, which allowed women in the state to hold
property, but not necessarily control it in the case of her husband’s
death. New York waited until 1848 to adopt a similar bill. An unmarried
woman had basically no rights whatsoever. Add into the mix the social
dynamics of the Puritanical American frontier and if a woman had a child
out of wedlock, her limited options became nearly non-existent. A woman
couldn’t petition for divorce until 1923, but that was only in cases of
adultery, and the accusation of adultery had to be proven, which was
often a he said she said and the law almost always sided with men. It
wasn’t until 1937 that women in America could file for divorce on the
grounds of drunkenness, insanity, or desertion, but notice that abuse is
starkly absent from that.

The important takeaway from all of this is that women handling the
birthing process allowed for a level of understanding and empathy that
male physicians simply are incapable of attaining. There were midwives
and female doctors who would perform abortions on the down low because
they knew that a child could absolutely ruin a woman’s life, medically
and socially alike. The early 1800s saw sweeping abortion restrictions
and such remained the status quo until Roe v. Wade in the 70s. But
abortion restrictions don’t stop abortions, they just reduce the safety
with which they can be performed. This isn’t a new issue; we’ve been
dealing with this for centuries.

My point in all of this is, back when America was great, life was really
hard for women and they had extremely limited options and risked social
disgrace once they found themselves in a situation outside of the
accepted margins of Christian morality. Think of how these social mores
affected the clandestine wives of polygamist marriages. Especially
younger unmarried women, or teenage brides. It’s not like one of these
polygamist teens could start showing with a baby and they would be taken
care of. They had no options at that point, as if they had options
before then. Once they were marked by one of the Mormon elite men, their
lives were already planned for them.

And to wrap this conclusion with how we began the episode, did abortions
happen in Nauvoo? This court case doesn’t go anywhere near proving that
abortions were done to protect the identity of polygamist wives and
protect the reputation of the prophet, but it does exhibit that people
at the time knew how to perform them, which shouldn’t be controversial,
but that tidbit of information may surprise some. Even this Dr. Brink
guy ended up taking another wife in 1870.

Call it spiritual wifery, celestial marriage, or any of the other terms
used to obfuscate what was really happening; engaging in an affair
wasn’t hard for the men of the day, they risked very little social
capital in doing so. But the women had everything to lose. That’s how
it’s always been. They were the people who suffered from the
consequences of these secretive affairs when society refused to accept
anything outside of the approved status quo.

Collectively, as a society, we’ve made progress, but that’s only come
through fierce advocacy, marches, public speeches, and lobbying
government. However, people exist everyday trying to take that progress
away and limit a person’s rights based on antiquated ideals and
misinformation. Society today owes a lot to women fiercely fighting for
their own rights because they’ve had to wrestle that power away from men
who didn’t want to give it up, sometimes even risking their own lives in
these fights. It’s not just the suffragettes of the early
20<sup>th</sup> century in their white pantsuits, this fight for some
kind of equality was happening long before Susan B. Anthony and Cady
Stanton were even born. We’ve made a lot of progress, but there’s always
more work to be done. The fight is never truly over as long as there are
people trying to take away freedoms that were only begrudgingly afforded
in the first place.

But there’s always an impermanence of gaining these rights. Women could
vote in Utah but lost right when they didn’t vote the way the people who
fought for their vote wanted them to vote. Maybe the conversation could
shift to not limiting, but expanding rights of people. All people… not
just women’s, men’s or baby’s rights. Maybe we talk about affordable
living wages, science-based sex education, affordable or free birth
control for everybody, de-stigmatizing women caught in suboptimal
situations or unwed parents, expanding adoption and foster-care rights,
and so many other ways the conversation can be had that doesn’t involve
that scary word of “abortion”. Women have always been getting abortions,
the best thing to do is to make them the most safe, humane, and painless
procedures as possible, always having the availability of the most
possible options.

It’s a deeply nuanced subject and a lot of passions on all sides quickly
generate conflict. Conflict definitionally will not result in
conclusions. Let’s all try to make the world a better place because if
we don’t, there won’t be much of a world to argue about while the sole
victor plants their flag atop a smoldering cinder of a planet.
