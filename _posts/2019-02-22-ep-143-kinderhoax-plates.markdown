Ep 143 – Kinderhoax Plates

On this episode, Joseph Smith is a fraud. We discuss two occurrences in
Nauvoo which prove that Jo didn’t have access to any knowledge that
people of his day did. First is the Greek Psalter incident where a guy
proved that Jo had no idea what language was on the parchment. After
that is the entirety of the Kinderhook Plates incident, which proves
beyond any shadow of a doubt that Jo unabashedly knew he was a fraud.
These incidents, coupled with the Book of Abraham in early 1842, reveal
Jo to be the liar he was.

Haters gunna hate\! People will often say that as a defense against
criticism, regardless of whether or not the criticism is founded. There
is some criticism that isn’t worth engaging, hecklers, trolls, people
who are just trying to make your life harder for the sake of dragging
somebody into a similar state of misery that they’re experiencing. In
those cases, sure, haters gunna hate.

However, there are legitimate criticisms that people in the public eye
will have lobbed at them which are quickly dismissed with that
throw-away line when they should be heeded. If you’re a dick and refuse
to accept that fact, when people call you out on being a total dick and
you ignore their criticisms by saying haters gunna hate, you loop those
people with legitimate criticisms in with people who are just being
annoying, and suddenly the baby and the bath water are out the window.

Even though criticisms can be couched in a detrimental or destructive
fashion, if there’s a nugget of truth at the foundation of a criticism,
it should be considered. A person in the public eye will always draw
critics, but critics are the people who point out when something is
awry.

If not for critical scholarship, Jo’s 1842 account of the first vision
would be the agreed-upon historical truth. Through critical scholarship,
as many as 7 previous accounts have surfaced revealing many
inconsistencies among the narratives. Critical scholarship has revealed
that the Book of Mormon simply cannot be reconciled with every field of
science. Critical scholarship has shown that the Book of Abraham was,
indeed, translated from the surviving Egyptian Papyri and was by no
means a “translation,” so much as a fabrication. These are all
criticisms of Joseph Smith that he would never listen to in his lifetime
and many people refuse to listen to today, but they’re all important.
Critical examinations of subjects and objects leads us closer to the
truths which underpin such concepts.

Joseph Smith was prominent in the public light and drew criticism from
many angles; criticism which was often well founded and couldn’t be
excused by haters gunna hate. However, apologists today still defend
against such criticisms like sycophants in a depraved cult of
personality. Today we’ll be discussing a few examples of contemporary
criticisms against Jo that completely shattered any claim he had to
being a prophet of God or scholar of any yet-to-be-deciphered languages
by the power of God.

A contemporary critic of Joseph Smith named Henry Caswell picked up a
copy of the March 1842 Times and Seasons, in which was printed the Book
of Abraham and the facsimiles from which the Book of Abraham was
supposedly translated. Henry Caswell, a professor and reverend, donned
the clothing of the plebian and embarked upon a journey to Nauvoo with
hopes of giving a sketch of the place, meeting the prophet, and possibly
proving him to be an imposter, all in one trip. It was ambitious, but
Henry Caswell was not a man to shy away from revealing religious
imposters for who they truly were. As a result of his visit, he
published a short pamphlet in 1842, which was revised and expanded into
a second edition in 1843. Here’s a brief reading from the introduction,
you’ll find the entire pamphlet in the show notes should you care to
read it yourself.

> THE following narrative, the result of a few weeks' leisure on
> shipboard, is again presented to the public, with a deep sense, on the
> Author's part, of the iniquity of an imposture, which, under the name
> of religion, is spreading extensively in America and in Great Britain.
> Mormonism needs but to be seen in its true light to be hated; and if
> the following pages, consisting almost exclusively of the personal
> testimony of the Author, should assist in awakening indignation
> against a cruel delusion and a preposterous heresy, he will consider
> himself amply rewarded. 

Henry Caswell had on his person a copy of a Greek Psalter. A Psalter is
a Greek manuscript of a Psalm of the Bible. The one Caswell had with him
he estimated to be from about the 1200s C.E. Caswell apparently
attempted to lure Jo into a little trap using this Greek Psalter. He
appropriated an oft-repeated line by Mormons today, spoken by Joseph
Smith himself on many occasions.

> They were, however, bent upon completing the journey which they had
> designed, and although they civilly listened to my statements, they
> professed to be guided in reference to Mormonism by that perverted
> precept of Scripture; “Prove all things, hold fast that which is
> good.”
> 
> From this moment I determined to visit the stronghold of the new
> religion, and to obtain, if possible, an interview with the prophet
> himself… In order to test the scholarship of the prophet, I had
> further provided myself with an ancient Greek manuscript of the
> Psalter written upon parchment, and probably about six hundred years
> old.

The day Caswell arrived, he attended a meeting at the temple
construction site. He recounts what was preached on some makeshift
platforms, but it’s not terribly important. He spent the day touring the
city and mingling with various Mormons. The next day he made his way to
Joseph’s newly-opened Red Brick Store and inquired of the shopkeeper,
probably Newell K. Whitney, of the whereabouts of the prophet. Here’s
how he relates the interaction from page 20-21 of his expose.

> Perceiving a respectable-looking store (or shop), I entered it, and
> began to converse with the storekeeper. I mentioned that I had been
> informed that Mr. Smith possessed some remarkable Egyptian
> curiosities, which I wished to see. I added that, if Mr. Smith could
> be induced to show me his treasures, I would show him in return a very
> wonderful book which had lately come into my possession. The
> storekeeper informed me that Mr. Smith was absent, having gone to
> Carthage that morning; but that he would return about nine o'clock in
> the evening. He promised to obtain for me admission to the
> curiosities, and begged to be permitted to see the wonderful book. I
> accordingly unfolded it from the many wrappers in which I had
> enveloped it, and, in the presence of the storekeeper and many
> astonished spectators, whom the rumour of the arrival of a strange
> book had collected, I produced to view its covers of worm-eaten oak,
> its discoloured parchments, and its mysterious characters. Surprise
> was depicted on the countenances of all present, and, after a long
> silence, one person wiser than his fellows, declared that he knew it
> to be a revelation from the Lord, and that probably it was one of the
> lost books of the Bible providentially recovered. Looking at me with a
> patronizing air, he assured me that I had brought it to the right
> place to get it interpreted, for that none on earth but the Lord's
> Prophet could explain it, or unfold its real antiquity and value.
> "Oh," I replied, "I am going to England next week, and doubtless I
> shall find some learned man in one of the universities who can expound
> it." To this he answered with a sneer, that the Lord had chosen the
> weak things of the world to confound the mighty; that he had made
> foolish the wisdom of this world; and that I ought to thank Providence
> for having brought me to Nauvoo, where the hidden things of darkness
> could be revealed by divine power. All expressed the utmost anxiety
> that I should remain in the city until the prophet's return.

Caswell tarried in the city until Jo returned. Once again, the
most-likely reason for Caswell coming to Nauvoo with the Psalter in the
first place was due to the Book of Abraham being published barely a
month prior to his trip. Caswell was one of the supposed learned men
that the Lord had sent the weak farmer boy, Joseph Smith, to confound,
and the people of Nauvoo were expressly confident in the prophet’s
abilities to translate that which mortal minds could not know. It seems,
from the way Caswell reported it, that he was retaining his cover of
being there for the sole purpose of exposing the prophet to be a fraud,
and as an outsider was met with this sanctimonious defiance that he
would even suggest that learned people might know more than these
people’s precious prophet. Caswell was finally granted an audience
with Jo, and this is how he relates their short interaction and it is
simply delightful.

> As I advanced with my \[Psalter\] book in my hand, numerous Mormons
> came forth from their dwellings, begging to be allowed to see its
> mysterious pages; and by the time I arrived at the prophet's house,
> they amounted almost to a crowd. I met Joseph Smith at a short
> distance from his dwelling, and was regularly introduced to him by the
> storekeeper. I had the honour of an interview with him who is a
> Prophet, a Seer, a Merchant, a "Revelator," a President, an Elder, an
> Editor, and the Lieutenant-General of the "Nauvoo Legion." He is a
> coarse, plebeian, sensual person in aspect, and his countenance

> large and fat, and on one of his fingers he wears a massive gold ring,
> upon which I saw an inscription. His eyes appear deficient in that

> house, accompanied by many elders, preachers, and other Mormon
> dignitaries. On entering the house, chairs were provided for the
> prophet and myself, while the curious and gaping spectators remained
> standing. 2 I handed the book to the prophet, and begged him to

> replied, that I believed it to be a Greek Psalter; but that I should
> like to hear his opinion. "No he said; "it ain't Greek at all, except,

> Egyptian Hieroglyphics." Pointing to the capital letters at the

> like the letters that was engraved on the golden plates." Upon this,

> ain't of no use to you, you don't understand it." "Oh yes," I replied;
> "it is of some use; for if I were in want of money, I could sell it

This is an incident in Mormon history that is lesser-known than many
others, but still quite interesting. Understandably, because this
incident clearly reveals Jo to be the fraud he was, apologists have been
forced to deal with this incident in some interesting ways from
attacking Caswell’s character, to claiming he fabricated everything, to
taking issue with Caswell’s description of Jo’s look and conduct because
it’s not how they view their prophet. Hugh Nibley, the foremost Mormon
apologist of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, devoted pages 191-287 of his
1961 book The Myth Makers to a fictional interview between himself and
Caswell. Kinda like I did with episode 3 of the Mark Hofmann series, but
Nibley’s book spends over 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the pages on this
interview where he creates a text-book straw-man of Caswell and
repeatedly tears it down.

Even the Times and Seasons in Oct 1843 reported on the incident. At the
time, White-out Willard Richards and John Taylor were the editors, both
are known for twisting or omitting facts to sell their own narrative.
Here’s a quick extract:

> REWARD OF MERIT.
> 
> It will be recollected by some, that a Mr. Caswell, professing to be
> an Episcopal minister, came to this city some twelve or eighteen
> months ago. He had with him an old manuscript, professing to be
> ignorant of its contents, and came to Joseph Smith, as he said, for
> the purpose of having it translated. Mr. Smith had a little
> conversation with him and treated him with civility, but as the
> gentleman seemed very much afraid of his document, he declined having
> any thing to do with it.

The entire article is about how Caswell had earned a position as a
curator of the English Church, thus the title of Reward of Merit. It’s
all couched in the idea of a person reaping the rewards of the world for
assailing the one true gospel in a public forum.

> Thus as a reward of merit for publishing detraction and falsehoods
> already concocted, and adding a very splendid edition of his own, he
> has proven himself worthy of being exalted to the honor of bearing the
> sacerdotal robes, and of being raised to the very high and dignified
> office of curate (\!\!\!\!) in the English church. He has truly gained
> himself unfading laurels, and by continuing in well doing, and
> assisting some of the Rev. blackguards, whom the church of England
> have employed in England to abuse the Mormons, he may perhaps gain
> further honors.

After Caswell’s interaction with Jo and Jo quickly fleeing the scene of
his own stupidity, Caswell approached Willard Richards about the
scenario, to which White-out Willard said, “sometimes Mr. Smith speaks
as a prophet, and sometimes as a mere man.”

Needless to say, this interaction certainly makes Jo look quite foolish.
If he was this quick to jump to his own conclusions about the parchment
and pronounce his conclusions as truth, how could anybody trust him with
any of his other supposed or claimed “translations”? If he misidentified
not only the content of the parchment, but even misidentified the
well-studied language on the parchment, how could any of his other
translations be trusted? I looked for a gospel topics essay on this
interaction but it doesn’t exist. FAIRMormon has an essay about it, but
they simply repeat the same ad hominem attacks and question Caswell’s
motivations, never dealing with the substance of the interaction that
makes the expose so insightful and revealing.

The entire expose is interesting and I’d recommend giving it a read
through if you’re interested. It’s just worth noting that the only
reason Caswell even travelled to Nauvoo in the first place was to meet a
person who had made some truly incredible and falsifiable claims which
Caswell wanted to investigate. Jo was in the public eye and rightfully
drew criticism from people when he would spout off on things he knew
nothing about. Haters gunna hate offers no refuge for this interaction,
but that doesn’t stop polemics from making those arguments.

The Caswell Greek Psalter incident happened in April of 1842, but our
timeline is currently resting in spring of 1843. So, why was this
relevant? Well, Jo was drawing increased criticism and hate from the
rest of the world with his growing political and theocratic power, which
the world was becoming very well-acquainted with as a result of Wreck-it
Bennett’s expose published at the very end of 42.

Here enters a man named Wilbur Fugate and his two friends, Robert Wiley
and Bridge Whitton. These guys were 3 jolly gents living in a town near
Nauvoo called Kinderhook, Illinois, right near Quincy where the saints
first settled after the Missouri exodus. Similar to Caswell, these guys
devised a plan to lure Jo into a trap to make him look a fool. However,
these three weren’t satisfied with presenting a simple Greek Psalter to
the self-proclaimed prophet and seeing what happened, they took it to
the next level.

Wilbur Fugate had some level of metallurgical expertise. He, along with
Wiley and Whitton made a set of six plates and used some chemicals to
etch them, making them appear ancient to untrained eyes. On April 16,
1843, they put their plan into play, and this is how it’s reported in
the Vogel History of the Church 5:395. I’ll read a long excerpt so you
know what it is we’re talking about here.

If you’ve read the CES letter or any biography of Joseph Smith, chances
are that the Kinderhook plates have come across your path. The
Kinderhook plates and the Greek Psalter incidents combined together so
soon after the Book of Abraham was published, supposedly translated from
the Egyptian papyri; these three items in Mormon history happening in
the span of one year prove Joseph Smith to be an unabashed fraud.

People at the time knew what was happening. What’s really incredible
about the release of this in the Times and Seasons is other news outlets
picked up on the gag long before any Mormons had. Included in the
discovery was a written statement signed by 9 men who certified the
authenticity of the unearthed treasure.

> “We, the citizens of Kinderhook, whose names are annexed, do certify
> and declare that, on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of April, 1843, while
> excavating a large mound in this vicinity, Mr. R. Wiley took from said
> mound *six brass plates* of a bell shape, covered with ancient
> characters. Said plates were very much oxidated—the bands and rings on
> said plates moldered into dust on a slight pressure. The above
> described plates we have handed to Mr. Sharp for the purposes of
> taking them to Nauvoo.
> 
> Robert Wiley; W.P. Harris; F.W.F. Ward; W. Longnecker; Fayette Grubb;
> Ira S. Curtis; Geo. Deckenson; W. Fugate; J.R. Sharp

What more do you need to know that something from the
19<sup>th</sup>-century is authentic than 9 guys signing their names to
a piece of paper claiming that it’s authentic? I couldn’t be more
convinced if the entire Fugate clan had signed the paper.

Immediately people made hay with this. The Quincy Whig, a paper which
started out friendly to the Mormons when they were first settling in
Quincy, but had shifted tone largely because of the 1842 election,
published an article that is absolutely incredible. The title alone
reveals the tongue-in-cheek nature of the article, but here it is, right
in the History of the Church, with some minor edits, in vol 5 page 398:

> SINGULAR DISCOVERY.-MATERIAL FOR ANOTHER MORMON BOOK.

The plates remained in Nauvoo for quite some time. On the 7<sup>th</sup>
of May we find this entry where Jo began his work translating the
contents of the plates.

June 24, 1843, the Nauvoo Neighbor, the rebranded Wasp after John Taylor
took it over from William Smith, printed facsimiles of the 6 plates and
you can see them to this day if you follow the links in the show notes.
As per the description, they’re 6 bell-shaped plates with engravings.
The engravings, however, are not a recognizable language. The creator,
Wilbur Fugate, was deliberate in not betraying the source of the
engravings. It’s notable that some of them bear resemblance to the
Egyptian hieroglyphics that were printed as the Book of Abraham
translation, but none of the engravings look exactly like the authentic
ancient Egyptian. Fugate did a good job in scratching symbols that look
authentically ancient, but aren’t from any single source other than his
own mind.

It’s important to note that Jo claimed he was commencing the translation
of the plates. The original Times and Seasons report included in the
History of the Church says that “President Joseph has translated a
portion, and says they contain the history of the person with whom they
were found; and he was a descendant of Ham, through the loins of
Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom through the
ruler of heaven and earth.”

Let’s unpack that a little bit because it introduces points where
apologists are able to mentally pretzel their way out of the issue.
First, this entry wasn’t written by Joseph Smith, rather it was in the
Nauvoo journal of his scribe at the time, William Clayton. When the
History of the Church was compiled they made everything in Joseph’s
first-person perspective even though the sources for the history came
from dozens of journals and letters not in Jo’s hand. That allows a
loophole. If Jo himself didn’t record that he was translating a portion
then William Clayton may have been misinformed or lying. The prophet
didn’t make a mistake, his scribe did. That’s a baffling and
disingenuous claim. If William Clayton said Jo did something, it
happened. This discrepancy doesn’t create a loophole big enough for Jo
to squeeze through.

Further, a contemporary account was printed in the New York Herald,
James Gordon Bennett’s paper, in May of 1843. This account is merely
signed, “A Gentile” with no actual name ascribed to it, but it is very
revealing and no longer places the onus on William Clayton of making an
error. Here’s a few relevant extracts from the passage, you’ll find a
link to the entire article from the Library of Congress in the show
notes:

> Late and Interesting From the Mormon Empire on the Upper
> Mississippi.—We have received very late accounts from the new Mormon
> religious empire, established by Joe Smith, the modern
> Mahomet—accounts which are very interesting and curious in a people
> which have attracted the attention of the public throughout the old
> and new world—in the Atlantic States, and the continent of Europe. Our

>

> issue another book of Mormon, that will wake up the world a second
> time. We shall wait for this development, with an open mouth at least…

Then it prints a letter sent from the said “Gentile” to Bennett. I can’t
tell if this was a letter to the editor, James Gordon Bennett, or if it
was sent to John C. Wreck-it Bennett and he forwarded the letter to
Gordon Bennett to print in the New York Herald. Even the contents of the
letter don’t offer any clarification. Here’s what intel is revealed from
the letter concerning the plates. Some is redundant, but there is an
interesting detail we’ll focus on.

> Suffice it to say, in view of this city \[of Nauvoo\] and its founder,
> that strange things have happened, and still things more strange may
> happen.
>

That last piece is a crucial piece of information because it carves out
another apologetic dodge. If Jo “translates” something by the gift and
power of god, like the Book of Mormon, then it can’t be wrong because
that would nullify his claims to being a prophet seer and revelator.
However, if we was using secular means to translate these Kinderhook
plates then he could make an error without voiding his god warranty.
Because he used the Egyptian alphabet he made in Kirtland, referred to
as his “Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language,” or “GAEL”, he
was using secular means to translate instead of using the gift and power
of god. You see the exception here. Allow me to quote from FAIRMormon to
make the point when they reference Don Bradley’s 2011 presentation on
the Kinderhook plates:

> Bradley noted that one of the most prominent characters on the
> Kinderhook Plates (a symbol shaped like a boat), when broken down into
> its individual elements matched a symbol found on page 4 (the second
> page of characters) of the Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian

> 
> The conclusion is that Clayton's account appears to be accurate, that
> Joseph did attempt to translate "a portion" of them by non-revelatory
> means, and the translation provided matches a corresponding symbol and
> explanation in the GAEL.

The argument here is that Jo used the Egyptian alphabet he made from the
Egyptian papyri back in 1835 to translate a character from the
Kinderhook plates. He didn’t use the gift and power of god with the rock
in the hat, therefore he was translating the Kinderhook plates as a man,
instead of as a prophet seer and revelator. Yes, that is an actual
apologetic argument used to exonerate Jo’s abilities to read unknown
languages. Seemingly absent from this argument is the next logical step.
His Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language (GAEL) was wrong, so
how could he translate the Kinderhook plates using an incorrect
alphabet? Further, he used Precious and Mr. Hat, the gift and power of
god, to create the GAEL and now he was using that divinely revealed
system to translate these fakes, doesn’t that doubly indict his claims
of being a translator? I quote again from FAIRMormon:

> At the time that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, he only
> claimed the ability to translate by the "gift and power of God." Over

Either Jo could translate unknown languages or he couldn’t. That goes
for the Kinderhook plates, the Greek Psalter, the Egyptian papyri that
became the Book of Abraham, and even includes the Book of Mormon. He
said he could do it and he was wrong. He knew he couldn’t do it, and
therefore he lied about it.

It’s worth noting that no actual translation ever came from Jo that was
the supposed contents of the Kinderhook plates. FAIRMormon cites Don
Bradley again when he contends with how Jo knew who the descendant was
and what the contents of the plates was. Jo claimed they were plates
containing the history of the person with whom they were found, who was
a descendant of Ham through the loins of Pharaoh. How could he possibly
know that if he couldn’t read what was on the rest of the plates? First
off, what would a black Egyptian be doing in Kinderhook Illinois with
metal plates of his own history? How did they get there? Did this one
Egyptian make a solo transatlantic trip to the Americas and sojourn to a
random mound in Illinois and die there just for his skeleton and history
to be found by Joseph Smith? Don Bradley points out a small boat-shaped
character on the top of one of the plates and finds a somewhat similar
looking character in Jo’s Grammar and Alphabet of Egyptian Language that
sort of fits the mold, but that’s completely speculative that Jo was
using that symbol and his own translation to claim that he knew the
contents of the Kinderhook plates. I would make the safe speculation
that Jo just made it up. Like he made up the Zelph story during Zion’s
camp, like he made up the Book of Abraham, like he made up the Book of
Mormon, he knowingly made it up. The Kinderhook plates reveal Jo to be
the fraud he truly was.

What I find even more fascinating about this story is that the
Kinderhook plates were regarded as authentic history until as recently
as the 1980s. Yes, even with the facsimiles of the plates being printed
in the Times and Seasons and the History of the Church showing exactly
what they were and the supposed language on them, Mormons for over a
century after Jo’s death believed they were what he claimed them to be.
They simply believe that Jo died before he had a chance to translate the
rest of the characters. We’ll get into how it’s dealt with today very
soon, but first, how did it come to light that this was all a hoax.

Even though contemporary sources knew it to be a fraud from the
beginning, it didn’t stop Mormons from regarding the plates as another
possible source text of forthcoming scripture. While Mormons patiently
awaited a prophet’s abilities to translate them, in 1879, Wilbur Fugate
finally appeared back on the scene with an affidavit that he had
colluded with the two other guys to fabricate the plates.

> \[H\]e stated that the plates were a humbug, gotten up by Robert
> Wiley, Bridge Whitton, and myself. Whitton (who was a blacksmith) cut

36 years. Wilbur Fugate waited until 36 years after the fact before he
came out with the affidavit that he and 3 others had colluded to make Jo
look like a fool. More importantly, he described the methods he used in
order to make the plates. When this came out in 1879, Mormons widely
regarded the Kinderhook plates as authentic. Also, this was a decade and
a half after the civil war and it was widely known that the plates had
been lost during the war, which makes it much harder to verify that they
weren’t authentic. So, why did he wait for 36 years before revealing the
conspiracy? Also, why was it only Wilbur Fugate, why didn’t Whitton or
Wiley ever come out with statements around the same time or even
earlier, maybe during Jo’s lifetime, that it was all a ruse? Apologists
at the time, including B.H. Roberts, seized on the incredibly late
revelation as a flaw in the veracity of Fugate’s claim. If he made it
all up, why wait so long? Why were there no corroborating accounts?
Should this guy not be believed because his affidavit concerns an event
36 years in the past? Because his affidavit is so long after the
occurrence, does it immediately follow that the plates are actually
authentic?

Here’s what Fugate said of the little hoax they cooked up:

Fugate’s affidavit reveals an important exercise in how we know history.
Sure the affidavit is more than three decades after the occurrence,
maybe he misspelled the names of his friends, maybe some of the details
of how they made the plates is a bit fuzzy, maybe he doesn’t remember
all of the people who were there when the plates were “discovered,”
maybe there are finer points within the late firsthand account that are
inaccurate, but the central focus of the affidavit, although late, is
true. Apologists defend the prophet by splitting hairs about whether or
not Jo himself claimed that he was translating the Kinderhook plates or
if that was secondhand contemporary and can’t be trusted, yet they’re
quick to dismiss this late firsthand account because it’s antagonistic
to the prophet. That’s not how we do history.

The apologist criticism of Fugate and the timing was summarized well in
*New Witness for God* on p.63 by B.H. Roberts when he said:

The apologists’ attacks on the affidavit and Fugate’s character carved
out a space where Mormons could believe in the authenticity of the
Kinderhook plates for quite some time. Couple that with the fact that
the plates were thought to be no-longer extant and available for expert
examination, a small window allowed Mormons for over a century to not be
troubled by the entire incident. Undoubtedly, Mormons contemporary with
Jo expected him to deliver new scripture from these plates. When he
died, they likely awaited the next prophet, be it James Strang, Sidney
Rigdon, or Brigham Young, to translate them by the gift and power of god
as the new prophet, seer, and revelator. That never happened. So why did
he wait so long? Fugate knew all along that the prank was successful,
why didn’t he come out any time before 1879 to reveal the plan?

Unfortunately, we can’t know for sure. We can speculate. Maybe he’d
forgotten about it. It happened just a few years before the Mormons were
no longer a major presence in Illinois and he wasn’t bothered by them
any longer. Maybe he didn’t reveal it while Jo and Brigham were alive
for fear of retaliation. Maybe he was waiting all along for the supposed
translation to come along and he’d do his big reveal. It’s only
speculation. What we can be certain of is that they were not authentic.
Even if Fugate didn’t make them and his story of fabricating them was a
hoax, they are not authentic Egyptian artifacts. Which leads to our
final point that drove the final nail in the coffin of the Kinderhook
plates.

In 1920, it was discovered that one of the 6 plates survived in the
archives of the Chicago Historical Society. This discovery now made it
possible to scientifically analyze the remaining plate. In 1953, two
non-Mormon experts examined the plate. 9 years after their examination,
apologist Welby W. Ricks, then president of the BYU Archaeological
Society, personally examined the plate. In the 1962 edition of the
Improvement Era, back when it actually printed articles by church
historians alongside ads for local Utah businesses, he printed his
findings, from which I quote a few passages. You’ll find a link to it on
archive.org in the show notes.

Then Ricks goes on to make the argument that would prove Fugate’s

A chemical analysis was finally done. It completely destroyed everything
Ricks claimed. Stanley Kimball published in the August 1981 edition of
the Ensign an article about the Kinderhook plates conceding any possible
faithful Mormon interpretation for the historicity of the Kinderhook
Plates.

The final concession at the end of the article tries to carve out an
ever-shrinking ground for apologists to live on when it comes to the
Kinderhook Plates:

So, the great saga of the Kinderhook plates came to an end in 1981.
Importantly, the church has never released another official statement on
the Kinderhook Plates since this Ensign article. I scoured LDS.org for
anything that wasn’t written nearly 4 decades ago, but there’s simply
nothing. What started as something crafted by some country bumpkin
hoaxers became a possible source for scripture, then evolved into a
historical enigma regarded as authentic Native American antiquities,
then rediscovered in the Chicago historical society as genuine
artifacts; and finally, at the end of it all, they’re regarded as the
hoax they were initially intended to be. The 1980 examination proved
they were indeed engraved and came from the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
completely shattering any ground for claims they were ever authentic,
thus verifying the claims of the man who created them, even though his
affidavit came 36 years after the occurrence.

If you listen to this show for the gotchas of Mormon history, you’re
coming to the wrong place. Go read the CES letter if you want easy
gotchas. However, once in a while, something comes up in our historical
timeline that so brazenly and clearly reveals Joseph Smith to be the
fraud he was. Jeremy Runnells summarized it so beautifully in the CES
Letter where he addressed the Kinderhook Plates:

> The plates were named after the town in which they were found -
> Kinderhook, IL. A farmer claimed he dug the plates out of a mound.
> They took the plates to Joseph Smith for examination and he translated
> a portion. Not only did Joseph not discern the fraud, he added to the
> fraud by “translating” the fake plates. The LDS Church now concedes
> it’s a hoax. What does this tell us about Joseph Smith’s gift of
> translation?

No, the translation of what the plates supposedly say doesn’t exist, but
the little part that Jo did “translate” about them being a history of
the person with which they were found, that’s enough to indict his
claimed abilities. If the Kinderhook plates portray Jo as a false
prophet, then so does the Book of Abraham. If the Book of Abraham
reveals him to be a fraud, all apologists have left is the Book of
Mormon, and that thing fell flat on its face before Jo did at Carthage.

Look, we can often get lost down the rabbit hole of true vs. false
prophets, but the Kinderhook plates alone reveal Jo to be a false
prophet he so often decried in public speeches. He was a fraud from day
one of Mormonism and that fraud only became more apparent every passing
day of his ministry. The Kinderhook plates are yet one more issue in the
pile of problematic Mormon history that can’t be ignored with haters
gunna hate.
