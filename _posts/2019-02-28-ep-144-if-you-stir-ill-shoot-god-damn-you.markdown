Ep 144 – If You Stir I’ll Shoot; God Damn You\!

On this episode, at the behest of Joseph Smith, Joseph H. Jackson
embarks on a mercenary trip to Missouri in hopes of breaking Porter
Rockwell out of jail and finishing off Ex-Governor Lilburn Boggs. His
true intent? Collude with Jackson County Sheriff Reynolds to arrest
Joseph Smith. He isn’t successful, but gathers some helpful intel to
bring back to the prophet to gain his trust. Joseph Smith heads to
Dixon, Illinois to preach but winds up arrested by Sheriffs Reynolds and
Wilson; mobs form everywhere they go. The Danites are called out to
canvass Illinois to break Jo out of custody and return him to the
Kingdom on the Mississippi, and Jo has a pistol smuggled to him. Content
warning for this episode, there’s some of strong language.

Joseph Smith was still on the run from Missouri. He’d been released on
the technicality on his writ of Habeas Corpus, but Missouri was still
trying to get him within state boundaries to prosecute him for his
crimes. Those crimes were accessory before the fact to attempted murder
of a public official, Lilburn W. Boggs, and all the old Missouri Mormon
war charges from 1838, being arson, robbery, and high treason. Jo was
still technically a fugitive from Missouri after his escape from custody
in spring of 1839, and if he stepped foot in the state of Missouri,
whether of his own volition, or in the custody of constables or bounty
hunters, he’d be arraigned in court on all those old charges and sent to
the gallows where he belonged.

To complicate matters, Jo’s underground enforcer, Orrin Pistol Packin’
Porter Rockwell, misnamed as the Destroying Angel of Mormonism, was
currently languishing in various jails throughout Missouri. But, Jo had
a new friend appear on the scene, Joseph H. Jackson, who promised that
he’d break Port out of jail and finish the botched Lilburn Boggs job
while he was there. Jo had acquired a horse and some provisions for
Jackson to make the trip from Nauvoo to Missouri, and had promised
Jackson that he’d pay him a handsome 3,000 dollars for a job well done.
Commissioning Jackson to break Port out of prison was literally the only
thing Jo did to try and help his childhood friend in his time of need.

As we progress from spring to summer of 1843, tensions were high in
Nauvoo. With the looming threat of a militia marching into Nauvoo to
arrest Jo, hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt currently in
default, and the expansion of the political power of the Mormons, the
kingdom on the Mississippi was beginning to look more like a house of
cards every day.

At the appointed time, Joseph H. Jackson began his journey to Missouri
to fulfill his mission of breaking out Port and killing Boggs. We pick
up from his account of how his journey transpired.

> The next morning after this adventure, I took my departure for
> Missouri. The weather was very bad, the streams high, and I suffered
> very much with the wet and cold. After a journey of eight days I
> arrived at Independence, where I put up with a Mr. Knowlton. At this

> looked rather uncouth. There were however, so many in prison at this

> be useful for the purposes which Harmon T. Wilson and myself had in

> thence journeyed to Nauvoo.

To recap the journey, Jackson wasn’t successful in anything he set out
to do. He initially departed Nauvoo promising Jo he’d break Port out,
that didn’t happen and he didn’t even get to talk to Pistol Packin’ Port
because there was so much commotion. He told Jo he’d finish off Boggs,
but he didn’t even make an effort to assassinate him, even if he’d
actually wanted to. Then, Jackson wanted to meet with Sheriff Reynolds
of Missouri to tell him that he was in the process of infiltrating the
Mormon hierarchy and they could affect a plan together to get Jo in
Missouri custody, but because of the recent Chavis murders he wasn’t
even able to meet with the sheriff to tell him what was going on. At
every point Jackson’s trip to Missouri was a failure. That’s true
whether you’re on Jo’s side or the anti-Mormons’ side trying to bring
justice on the Mormon demagogue.

However, Jackson was able to gather intel for Jo. Always keep in mind
that this is the 19<sup>th</sup>-century before telegraphs. Information
travelled at the pace of a galloping horse across the nation, and the
information that Jackson was able to gain was very helpful to him. That
information is the fact that Sheriff Reynolds of Missouri was currently
working on a plan to get into Nauvoo and arrest Jo with updated
documentation that didn’t have the legal loopholes that Jo used to
escape custody with his writ of Habeas Corpus back in January of 1843.

When Jackson returned he sought out a meeting with Jo to update him on
how the mission went. He inserts a few interesting details, including a
brief sketch of Emma and the fact that Jo liked to gossip with his
circle of elites around town. Undoubtedly, he’d told some of his trusted
friends that Jackson had left to break out Port and kill Boggs, which
Jackson wasn’t able to do, but was treated as if he’d been successful.

> On my arrival, I rode to the house of the Prophet, where all seemed
> glad to see me, and "sister Emma," Joe's wife, received me very
> cordially, the Prophet not being at home. Since I have introduced this
> lady to the reader, I will mention that although she is acquainted
> with all the villainous plans and operations of Joe, yet she should be
> looked on with pity rather than scorn. I believe she knew no guile
> until Joe schooled her to wink at his rascality, and compelled her by
> threats to aid in carrying out his measures. Indeed, he has frequently
> said that it was with the greatest difficulty that he could prevail on
> Emma, in many cases, to hold her peace, and not expose him to the
> world.   
>   
> In order to amuse myself until the Prophet's return I strolled over
> the city, and was surprised to find so much attention paid to me; and
> that many, especially the women, knew all about my expedition to
> Missouri. convinced me, that Joe could not keep his secrets, but I
> could not know at that time he had so many wives to whom to disclose
> them. When night came on, the Prophet returned. 

Now Jackson was in Jo’s house, about to tell him how the mission went.
This was a dangerous situation for Jackson to be in. If he let on that
he hadn’t been successful because he had no real intention of being
successful from the beginning, then his grand plans to infiltrate the
Mormon elite circle would be discovered and he wouldn’t make it out of
the city alive. However, if he could tell the story of his Missouri trip
to Jo in just the right way, Jo would buy into it and consider Jackson
even more trustworthy than before his departure, even though he failed
his mission. This is how Jackson reports the meeting. You’ll find a link
to his entire expose in the show notes, of course.

> He seemed glad to see me, and taking me by the hand led me into a
> private room, and commenced his enquiries about Porter Rockwell. He
> fixed his eyes steadily on me, while I gave an account of my
> stewardship, and suffered me to proceed about half through without
> interruption, when he suddenly exclaimed. "Oh\! did you kill old
> Boggs?" No\! said I, he was not at home; and this was the fact, as
> good luck would have it, and it gave me an exellent excuse. Joe seemed
> to regret this very much; but soon returned to Rockwell's case, and
> prophecied "in the name of the Lord that he would after passing
> through the fiery ordeal of the Missouri tribulation, come safely
> home. He said he knew that they could prove nothing against him, for
> he was a true man, and they could not make him own a word of it if we
> was guilty.

So, Boggs wasn’t dead, Port was still in prison, and Jo was no better
off than when Jackson departed. You can sense the tension in the rest of
the meeting.

> Silence ensued for a few minutes, when Joe suddenly looked me full in
> the eye, and after gazing steadily for a few moments said. "Jackson
> you are the first man that I have ever met that I could not look
> down." Said I, "do you like a bold eye?" He replied that he did and
> then commenced a panegyric on himself.

Jo was sizing up Jackson, trying to decide if he was gazing into the
eyes of a friend or foe. He probably saw him as a possible strong ally,
but somebody who he couldn’t quite pin down. After this awkward
interaction, Jo decided to float out a trial balloon to see how Jackson
would deal with it.

> He said that he was a good and godly man, and that he had never known
> wrong in his life, for in all his acts, he was guided and protected by
> the power of the Holy Ghost -- that the Missourians had tried to kill
> him, but rifle balls could have no effect on him, for he had been shot
> at thirteen times in Missouri, and the balls bounded back as hail from
> the side of a house; and for this reason he knew the Holy Ghost was
> with him, and that he truly was the greatest man on the earth. To this
> I replied that it was altogether Unnecessary for him to preach
> rascality to me, in the name of the Lord, for the more he did it the
> less I should think of him.

Jackson drew a line. Jo could preach about how much he was persecuted by
the Missouri mobocrats, but Jackson was no sycophant like the thousands
of Mormons in Nauvoo. He wouldn’t buy the pile of manure Jo was serving
up. Instead, Jackson decided to take a different approach to test Jo’s
character. He decided it was time to ask Jo about his first few days in
Nauvoo back in late 1842. When Jackson had first appeared on the scene,
the Mormons thought him to be a spy and tried to kill him. He was shot
at while moving some cargo for a shop owner in town, just trying to make
a buck. The unknown would-be assassin fled into the night and Jackson
recovered from the powder burn on his face, the bullet had missed.
Jackson decided to tell Jo this story to see how Jo would react.

> I then related what had occurred to me the previous fall in Nauvoo,
> giving him a full account of my being shot at, not letting him know
> however, that I suspected him or cared anything about it. My object
> was to learn from his own lips, by seeming indifference to the matter,
> whether he in reality had been black-hearted enough to send a man to
> perform so dastardly an act. He however pretended perfect innocence,
> and could divine no reason why I had been shot at.

Jo’s ability to wear whatever hat necessary in any given situation was
quite a remarkable character trait. He could play the persecuted
religious leader, the bible scholar, the pious prophet, the mouthpiece
of God, and even play dumb depending on the situation. That’s exactly
what he did here. Jo tried a few different hats with Jackson and finally
found one that fit. From this interaction, according to Jackson at
least, he gained the trust of the prophet, even though he’d failed his
mission. Jo gave him a place to stay in the Nauvoo Mansion that night,
but not before a parting word of what his plans were for Jackson.

> Here ended our conversation for the evening, and Joe took me up stairs
> to my chamber. As he bade me good night, he pronounced the blessing of
> God on my head, and said that he never loved a stranger as he did me,
> and that he had trusted me further for a short acquaintance, than he
> had ever done any man before; but said he "you must kill old Boggs and
> I will build you up in the world."   
>   
> In order to fathom the depths of Joe's villainy, I was obliged to
> appease to him as an abandoned wretch and outcast. When I told him I
> was a fugitive from justice and had committed the darkest crimes, it
> seemed to give him the greatest confidence, and he immediately run
> away with the idea that he could through me fulfil his prophecies, and
> then on the top of it he would urge me to carry out his measures "in
> the name of the Lord."

Jo thought he could still use Jackson to complete the mission he’d
failed to complete in Missouri. Jo wanted Boggs dead and he viewed
Jackson as the perfectly situated guy to fulfill his prophecy. Consider
Jo’s position here. Jackson was relatively new on the scene. Jo owed him
absolutely no fealty. He had no value to Jo except of his ability to
carry out Jo’s plans. Jackson hadn’t done that, so was still in a
tenuous place with the prophet. Could Jackson be trusted? How much can
you trust any mercenary who just randomly appears on the scene at a time
when you’re wanted by 2 different states and a territory? Jo’s grasp on
power was slipping and Jackson provided an opportunity to increase that
grasp, but only if he was truly loyal to the prophet.

Continuing further in Jackson’s expose, him and Jo took a little
carriage ride together a few days after this meeting. We’ll forego
discussing what happened there for the time being as it relates to
polygamy, D\&C 132, William Law, Hyrum Smith, and the Partridge sisters,
which will require an episode or two in and of itself very soon. For now
we’ll skip that bit and cut to what happened next.

Jo received intel that Sheriffs Joseph Reynolds of Missouri and Harmon
T. Wilson of Hancock county Illinois had the proper documentation in
order and were headed to Nauvoo to arrest him. John C. Wreck-it Bennett
had been working with the Missouri government to procure the necessary
documentation to arrest Jo on all the old Missouri Mormon war crimes,
and now Sheriff Reynolds was on his way to Governor Ford’s office to get
a new writ of arrest and extradition for Jo. From page 449-50 of volume
5 of the Vogel history of the church:

> To show the wickedness and rascality of John C. Bennett and the
> corrupt conspiracy formed against me in Missouri and Illinois, I
> insert the following under date of the letter:--
> 
> Independence, Mo., June 10, 1843
> 
> TO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR FORD \[of Illinois\]
> 
> Sir:--For the last three months I have been corresponding with Dr.
> John C. Bennett, relative to one certain Jo Smith, Mormon Prophet,
> \&c., of your State. In several of Dr. Bennett’s letters to me, he

> authorizes me without hesitation to write you full upon a subject that

> interested.
> 
> At the last term of the circuit court of Daviess county, an indictment

> \[Commander-in-chief of the Mob in Jackson County\]

With this new intel, Jo knew that he was square in the crosshairs of two
sheriffs who had the proper documentation to legally arrest him and
extradite him to Missouri. Jo put the Nauvoo Legion on red alert to
watch out for any intruders making their way into Nauvoo, expecting to
be alerted if anybody made their way into town to arrest him.

It’s necessary to consider this situation from all angles here. Sheriffs
Reynolds and Wilson knew that if they entered Nauvoo they’d quickly be
dealt with. Whether that meant the Nauvoo Legion running them out of
town, or them just simply disappearing at the hands of the Danites,
these guys entering Nauvoo was embarking far behind enemy lines in
hostile territory. They had the law on their side to arrest and
extradite Joseph Smith, but laws are only effective when armies like the
Nauvoo Legion don’t keep you from enforcing them. Nauvoo was a criminal
empire with Jo sitting at the top, it was part of the union and the
state of Illinois, but it behaved as a sovereign city-state. A criminal
city-state is only beholden to the laws its begrudgingly forced to abide
by. Reynolds and Wilson knew that as soon as they had Jo in their
custody that they’d be in severe danger of the Nauvoo Legion
bushwhacking them and springing their commander-in-chief. At that point,
Jo would simply disappear into any of his dozens of ratholes in the city
and they’d never get their hands on him again. The stakes for making
this arrest were high and the consequences held everybody’s life in the
balance.

Jo was scheduled to lecture in a small town called Dixon, Illinois. It’s
about 170 miles from Nauvoo, about 100 miles directly west of Chicago.
Jo had brought his wife and kids with him. Sheriffs Reynolds and Harmon
Wilson became aware of this information and decided it best to make
their arrest the day Jo was scheduled to lecture. However, Jo also
received intel that they’d be in Dixon waiting for him, so he decided to
stay about 15 miles away at a member’s house in a smaller village called
Inlet. He sent a letter to the Dixon congregation that he wouldn’t be
able to preach to them, which they apparently were much dissatisfied in
learning. However, when that letter went out, the two sheriffs became
privy to this new intel and traced the messenger, William Clayton, back
to where Jo was currently hiding in Inlet. This is how it went down,
beginning on page 468 of vol. 5.

> I sent \[William\] Clayton to Dixon…, to try and find out what was
> going on there. He met Mr. Joseph H. Reynolds, the sheriff of Jackson
> County, Missouri, and Constable Harmon T. Wilson, of Carthage,
> Illinois, about half way, but they being disguised, they were not
> known by him.
> 
> And when at Dixon they represented themselves as Mormon elders who
> wanted to see the Prophet. They hired a man and team to carry them,
> for they had run their horses almost to death.
> 
> They arrived at Mr. Wasson’s while the family were at dinner, about 2
> p.m.; they came to the door, said they were Mormon elders, and wanted
> to see brother Joseph. I was in the yard going to the barn, when
> Wilson stepped to the end of the house and saw me; he accosted me in a
> very uncouth, ungentlemanly manner, when Reynolds stepped up to me,
> collared me, then both of them presented cocked pistols to my breast,
> without showing any writ, or serving any process.

Jo must have struggled against the arresting officers, and received what
he considered brutal treatment by them in response to his protestations.

> Mr. Reynolds cried out, “God damn you, if you stir I’ll shoot; God
> damn you, if you stir one inch I shoot you; God damn you, be still, or
> I’ll shoot you by God.” I enquired, “What is the meaning of all this?”
> “I’ll show you the meaning by God, and if you stir one inch I’ll shoot
> you, God damn you.” I answered, “I am not afraid of your shooting, I
> am not afraid to die”; I then bared my breast and told them to shoot
> away; “I have endured so much oppression, I am weary of life, and kill
> me, if you please. I am a strong man, however, and with my own natural
> weapons could soon level both of you; ;but if you have any legal

> offer resistance.” Reynold\[s\] replied, “God damn you, if you say
> another word, will shoot you, by God.” I answered, “Shoot away, I am
> not afraid of your pistols.”

Jo was now under the arrest of constable Harmon Wilson from Carthage
Illinois and Sheriff Joseph Reynolds of Jackson county Illinois. They
had him. They had the documentation they needed and the writ of
extradition from Governor Ford of Illinois to move Jo across the state
line to Missouri so he could finally face the proper criminal justice
system he’d evaded 4 years ago. Getting Jo under arrest was the easy
part. Now they were 150 miles North and east of Nauvoo and had to
transport Jo across most of Illinois before they’d make their way into
Missouri with him in their custody when they’d be considered safe. As
soon as they had their pistols up against Jo’s side, threats from all
directions were realized because these sheriffs were in hostile
territory and everybody was a potential threat. Stephen Markham, the
prophet’s personal detail during his trip to Dixon, saw these two
unknown men pointing guns at his prophet with no explanation and decided
to act. Markham, as a member of the Nauvoo Legion, had been training for
this moment for years.

> By this time Stephen Markham walked deliberately towards us; when they
> saw him coming, they turned their pistols from me to him, and
> threatened his life if he came any nearer, but he paid no attention to
> their threats, and continued to advance nearer. They then turned their
> pistols on me again, jamming them against my side, with their fingers
> on the triggers, and ordered Markham to stand still, or they would
> shoot me through. As Markham was advancing rapidly towards me, I said,
> “You are not going to resist the officers, are you, brother Markham?”
> He replied, “No, not if they are officers; I know the law too well for
> that.”

Markham backed off once Jo told him these guys were lawmen. But, how
could he know before that. He just saw a couple guys holding guns on Jo
and sprung to action the way a good Nauvoo Legionnaire should. We should
keep in mind that this whole ordeal is a bit dramatized, recounted by Jo
after his return. He’s the hero baring his chest at the mobocrats and
daring them to shoot him. He claims they refused to produce
documentation to prove they were there on official business, instead
they apparently continued to push Jo around with the muzzle of their
pistols. Jo was still in his nightclothes though and petitioned the men
to hold on a moment so Emma could bring out his hat and jacket. They
refused, but the commotion drew Emma and the Smith children out of the
home. Stephen Markham grabbed the reins of the horses and wouldn’t let
them leave until Emma brought out his hat and some clothes. But you
really can’t blame the sheriffs for trying to get Jo away from any of
his allies. Every person he spoke to from then until they got to
Missouri provided an opportunity for him to give them information that
would bring the Nauvoo Legion crashing down on the posse.

Now, the sheriffs had a choice to make. They could take Jo to Rock
River, a tributary of the Mississippi, and canoe him down river until
they hit the Miss and then board a steamer at Davenport which would take
him all the way to St. Louis and they’d have him safely in custody in
the state of Missouri. But, a 3-day river trip in a canoe going only one
direction was a vulnerable place for these sheriffs to have Jo in
custody. They’d be ambushed long before they even made it to the steamer
in Davenport. Even if they did make it on a steamer, it would go right
past Nauvoo before it hit St. Louis. There’s no way they could conceal
Jo via this route.

They could take him over land, south from Dixon, through Peoria, but
that meant they’d cross the Mississippi at Quincy, Illinois, a town of
majority Mormons where they first settled when they were removed from
Missouri in 1839. This route meant that halfway through their 450-mile
journey, they’d be passing within a single day’s ride of Nauvoo. How
could they conceal Jo with this route? It would be impossible and they’d
be within rough rider range of thousands of people willing to die for
Jo. It’s two guys, they couldn’t hold off the Nauvoo Legion.

There was no easy option for these sheriffs to get Jo to Missouri
because Nauvoo was between them and Missouri no matter what direction
they went. That was the long-term plan they would think about once they
could get Jo locked up for the night as darkness was beginning to fall.
They chose to ride to the nearest tavern, which was in Dixon, something
like 10 miles away. Stephen Markham rode ahead to rally any Mormons he
could find in Dixon, where Jo was supposed to be preaching that day, but
had cancelled because of the threat of arrest. That didn’t too much
matter anymore, but there ought to have been some friend in Dixon
Markham could appeal to in order to help him spring Jo from the
sheriffs’ custody.

The posse arrived at the tavern in Dixon, much to the protestations of
their prisoner. This was a town with many Mormons, the sheriffs were
playing a dangerous game.

> On arriving at the house of Mr. McKennie, the tavern-keeper, I was
> thrust into a room and guarded there without being allowed to see
> anybody, and fresh horses were ordered to be ready in five minutes.
> 
> I again stated to Reynolds, “I wish to get counsel,” when he answered,
> “God damn you, you shan’t have counsel; one word more, God damn you,
> and I’ll shoot you.”
> 
> “What is the use of this so often,” said I, “I have often told you to
> shoot, and I now tell you again to shoot away.”

Reynolds and Wilson were denying Jo counsel while he was under arrest.
Doing such was a violation of the constitution, sort of. It’s violating
the constitution to deny a person legal counsel in a court of law, but
these guys weren’t trying Joseph Smith yet, they just had him in custody
to transport him. Regardless, there is some schadenfreude in seeing a
guy like Jo, who flagrantly ignored any laws inconvenient to him,
appealing to these sheriffs to follow the rule of law when they weren’t
actually doing anything illegal. The sheriffs were on the defensive
though, it’s important to understand how afraid they were because they
were not among friends and their prisoner could easily affect an escape
should an opportune time arise. Stuff like this must have been a bit
stressing:

> I saw a person passing, and shouted to him through the window, “I am
> falsely imprisoned here, and I want a lawyer.” Lawyer Edward Southwick
> came, and had the door banged in his face, with the old threat of
> shooting him if he came any nearer.
> 
> Another lawyer (Mr. Shepherd G. Patrick) afterwards came and received
> the same treatment, which began to cause considerable excitement in

> 
> A Mr. Lucien P. Sanger asked \[Stephen\] Markham what was the matter,
> when he told him all, and stated that the sheriff intended to drag me
> away immediately to Missouri, and prevent my taking out a writ of
> habeas corpus.

Any of these guys walking by the tavern hearing Jo’s cries of false
imprisonment could have been a member of the Destroying Angels. If
anybody in this little town of Dixon had sworn their oaths of fealty to
the prophet, promising to defend his life at the cost of their own,
these two sheriffs would have been quickly overwhelmed. Once again,
however, intel travelled at the speed of horse, and Jo had only been in
their custody for a few hours by this point. The sheriffs were already
in danger of a mob uprising and they were only at their first stop with
Jo in their custody. And that’s just what happened, a mob formed outside
the tavern, mostly of Mormons and Gentiles friendly to the Mormons.

Let our prophet have some legal counsel, or we’ll deal with you the way
Illinois Republicans deal with Missouri Democrats. Sensing an uprising
if they continued to oppose, the sheriffs granted audience of the
prophet for his counselors. They were allowed to enter the room, with
Sheriff Wilson constantly keeping a gun on Jo in case he tried any funny
business. Jo told them to get the local master-in-chancery to swear out
a writ of habeas corpus. Stephen Markham, Jo’s trusted friend throughout
the whole ordeal, rode to the local justice of the peace and sued a writ
of habeas corpus and filed a complaint of assault and threatening Jo’s
life. This led to the Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson being arrested by the
Dixon constable, while Jo was arrested by them. Then, Sheriff Wilson did
some legal trickery. Sheriff Wilson was a constable of Carthage,
Illinois, and beholden to follow the laws of Illinois. However, Sheriff
Reynolds was a Sheriff of Jackson County, Missouri, and therefore was
only on assignment to bring his target to Missouri and not subject to
the same laws as Sheriff Wilson. So, Wilson transferred Jo to the
custody of Sheriff Reynolds, all while the sheriffs were in the custody
of the Dixon city constable. This pushed the case of Jo’s custody to the
Missouri Sheriff and therefore into the jurisdiction of the Missouri
courts, thus nullifying the writ of habeas corpus Stephen Markham had
attained for Jo. However, now the issue of the sheriffs being in the
custody of the Dixon constable was something they had to deal with,
meaning they sent their own messenger before the local justice of the
peace to get their own writ of habeas corpus.

What all of this amounts to is Jo buying time. Undoubtedly, Emma and the
people the Smiths were staying with in Inlet, Illinois were on their way
back to Nauvoo to alert Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, and Bloody Brigham
Young of the fact that Jo was in custody of a Missouri Sheriff. Once
that intel got to Nauvoo, the Legion would be brought out in full force
and the sheriffs were as good as dead, and Jo as good as free. But, it
was 170-mile journey from inlet to Nauvoo, and this information moved at
the speed of horse, meaning they were about 4-5 days away with a fast
rider from learning that Jo was captured and doing anything about it.

Stephen Markham brought back the writ of habeas corpus for Joseph to
present it to the sheriffs. They let him in the room and he conveniently
snuck a pistol into Jo’s pocket. This was not the first, nor the last
time that a friend of the prophet would smuggle a pistol to him while he
was under arrest.

A jack-Mormon, Cyrus Walker, was a lawyer who was out electioneering as
a Whig candidate for Illinois’s sixth congressional district. He was
somebody Jo wanted by his side to help with these legal troubles. Jo
sent Stephen Markham to find Cyrus Walker out on the election trail.
Walker told Markham that he was too busy to represent Jo in this most
recent legal spat. Then Markham told Walker that Jo would make it worth
his while to go help him out in his time of need.

In response to the change in custody from Sheriff Wilson of Illinois to
Sheriff Reynolds of Missouri, a new writ of habeas corpus was sued, this
time in Lee County district, instead of just the small jurisdiction of
Dixon city. This writ also alleged $10,000 in damages by the constables
to Jo’s person. The county justice of the peace, another Jack Mormon
sympathetic to the plight of the Mormons, and possibly seeking
reelection by gaining the Mormons’ favor, placed Sheriffs Wilson and
Reynolds into the custody of the Lee county sheriff, held on $10,000
bond. This forced the Sheriffs to send a petition to Jackson County,
Missouri to have their bond removed by Governor Reynolds of Missouri.
All of this just bought more time.

In order to sort out this mess, Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson had to take
Jo to a hearing before Judge Caton, while still in custody of the Lee
county sheriff. They made it to a town just outside of Ottawa, Illinois
named PawPaw Grove, where there was a hotel. This was south and slightly
east along the highway from Dixon where they had initially held Jo. The
Sheriffs chose to confine Jo in the small hotel there for the night.

They were further south than Dixon, meaning the population of nearby
towns was increasingly Mormon the closer to Nauvoo the approached. When
the Sheriffs and Jo got to town, a mob slowly formed around the hotel,
wondering why Joseph Smith was under arrest and if these two sheriffs
were just Missouri mobocrats coming to kidnap and kill their prophet.
They wanted to hear Jo speak, but the Sheriffs wouldn’t let him, because
who knows what he might say, who knows how effective he’d be at riling
them up. They didn’t know what to expect. Before I read this next quote,
always keep in mind the ideological divides between Republican
abolitionist Illinoisans and Slave-owning states’ rights, blue blooded
Jacksonian Democrat Missourians in this exchange. The divide back then
across that one state line is like California is to Utah today if Salt
Lake City dropped off the face of the planet.

Jo was allowed to speak after this old guy got in the faces of the
sheriffs. Him talking about the highest tribunal in the United States,
he wasn’t talking about the Supreme Court, he was talking about the
Destroying Angels. Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds knew they if they made
any mistakes with Jo in their custody that the Danites would be upon
them.

The judge who was supposed to hear the cases of habeas corpus writs,
both on behalf of Jo and of the two sheriffs who had been arrested, was
on a visit to New York, so he couldn’t hear their case. But they
couldn’t go any further without resolving the issues of arrest and
habeas corpus writs, so they went back North to Dixon, Illinois and
threw Jo into the same room they’d held him in two days prior.
Throughout all of this, time was on Jo’s side. Every day they didn’t get
closer to the Missouri border was another day the Danites could
formulate a plan to spring Jo from Reynolds and Wilson’s custody.

William Clayton, Jo’s closest personal assistant and scribe, had left
Inlet for Nauvoo as soon as Jo was arrested to tell the leadership in
Nauvoo of what was going on with their prophet. On the day that Jo and
the sheriffs arrived in Dixon, William Clayton arrived in Nauvoo and
immediately told Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith of what had happened to his
brother. Hyrum called a special meeting in the Masonic Hall, but it was
moved to the grove because too many people showed up.

The Danites were officially mobilized on land and water in search of Jo.
The only information they were going on had come from William Clayton
who told them they were taking Jo to Dixon. From Dixon they could travel
by water or land, but both routes would run by Nauvoo, making it a
dangerous situation for the sheriffs. However, they didn’t have much say
in the matters because they were under arrest of the Constable of Lee
county, who worked under the shadow command of Joseph Smith. So, after
the writs of habeas corpus for Jo were returned as invalid because the
judge wasn’t there to hear the case, Jo acquired a new writ of habeas
corpus which was to be heard in front of Judge Stephen A. Douglas at
Quincy, Illinois. Stephen A. Douglas was a long-time friend of the
Mormons because it was politically advantageous at the time. He’d helped
pass the Nauvoo Charter, he’d chaired a number of municipal court
hearings relative to Mormon matters, he was a Jack Mormon. This would
come as a liability to him on the campaign trail against Abraham Lincoln
in about a decade and a half from where our timeline currently resides.
Needless to say, Jo must have been elated to get this new writ to appear
in front of Douglas because he knew if he were granted the hearing,
without being dragged into Missouri first, he was home free because
Douglas would grant the habeas corpus writ.

With the change of power into Jo’s hands, he now dictated the actions of
the posse, even though he was in custody of the sheriffs. Jo hired a man
named Lucien P. Sanger to carry them by coach to Quincy, Illinois, where
they would appear before Judge Stephen A. Douglas. But, he was still
smart enough to protect against any funny business that Sheriffs Wilson
or Reynolds might cook up on the 260 mile journey there.

This intel was making its way back to General Wilson Law, a
Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, possibly also a member of the
Danites. If there was a time in Jo’s history when he needed Pistol
Packin’ Porter Rockwell, this was it. Unfortunately, Port was still
languishing in Missouri jails because Joseph Jackson hadn’t been
successful in his mission. However, Port received some intel of his own
that Jo was arrested. From Port’s own account after he returned to
Nauvoo in vol 6 of the Vogel History of the Church.

Jo’s most trusted Destroying Angel, locked in prison, chained hands to
ankles, freezing cold with no eatable food, no money to purchase coal to
burn to keep him warm, while he knew Sheriff Reynolds was on his way to
Dixon to arrest Jo. A single dove flying around his cell was comfort he
desperately needed to lift his anxiety. If only Joseph Jackson had been
able to break him out, but that was never Jackson’s true intent. He was
there to infiltrate the Mormons, and he wanted to meet with Sheriff
Reynolds before Reynolds made his arrest. However, Reynolds either
wasn’t aware of that fact, or considered Jackson to be totally in
league with the Mormons. Jackson’s loyalties would be tested with Jo in
custody of Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson. Once again from his expose of
August 1844:

Now, Joseph Jackson was a commissioned officer of the Danites, headed
out to break the prophet out of state custody at all hazards. Jackson
and nearly 200 other men were canvassing the entire state of Illinois in
search for the prophet. No cell phones, so Wilson Law or Hyrum Smith
couldn’t just send a text to Jo, hey, where you at? They had to travel
all the major highways and attempt to cover the backroads in case the
sheriffs were trying to outsmart them, all while another company
proceeded up the Mississippi toward Davenport and Dixon to try and
apprehend them should they be travelling by steamer. The night watch of
the Nauvoo Legion was doubled and there was a constant guard out in case
Governor Ford decided to capitalize on the missing prophet opportunity
to break down the city walls with an Illinois militia.

What this all amounts to is Jo having every single base covered. He had
his people covering the entire state on all major roads looking for him.
He had people up and down the Mississippi ready to rescue him. All his
boys were armed to the teeth and ready for action. Sure, he was in
custody of the two sheriffs, but they were in the custody of his boy and
they were headed within a few miles of Nauvoo for a habeas corpus
hearing that would be chaired by somebody who’d shown broad fealty to
the Mormons since their settlement in Nauvoo. His primary Destroying
Angel may not have been there to help but dozens of men were there to
step into Pistol Packin’ Porter’s place and give their life for Jo’s.
More than anything, he had time on his side. And, beyond all of these
variables being in his control, he also had a pistol smuggled on his
person, which was force multiplied by his element of surprise. All it
would take is a little bit of chaos and the sheriffs turning their back
on him for just a moment and he could kill them himself.

Consider the circumstance from the Missouri government’s position.
Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson had a very slim chance of success. Not only
did they have to cross the entire state through increasingly dense
Mormon cities without a Mormon mob exerting their own vigilante justice,
but after making the trip they had to get a favorable ruling on their
own writ of habeas corpus without Jo’s being granted in a hostile court,
and then they had to get him across the Mississippi and the state line
of Missouri without being overrun by Danites who would certainly kill
them if their paths crossed.

This is how the Mormon mafia worked. Government officials who were
supposed to keep demagogues in check were playing by the rules, while Jo
picked and chose what rules he and his cronies would follow. There is no
winning against a kingpin this powerful and Jo would NEVER willingly
give up this much power. Nothing short of a military coup, or an open
battle between the Illinois militia and the rebel Mormon militia, would
ever unseat this despotic regime. Praise to this man? This is the guy
Mormons sing their praises to and bear their testimonies about every
month? This was not religious persecution, this was the due process of
law; a system we all agree to abide by but apparently fails its quality
control mechanisms when it suffers such flagrant abuse at the hands of
one sociopath. That’s how criminal empires are built. Small degrees of
abusing the rule and order of law until a critical mass is reached where
no system, regardless of how robust, can stop the wheels of revolution
from turning. Sure, you get whistleblowers and rogue lawyers sounding
the alarm, but by that time it’s far too late. The damage has been done.
In 1843, much like 2019, it’s just too late.
