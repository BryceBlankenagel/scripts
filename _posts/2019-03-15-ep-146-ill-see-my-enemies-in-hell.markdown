Ep 146 – I’ll See My Enemies in Hell

On this episode, Joseph Smith was safe in his kingdom on the
Mississippi. A legal mess had been mixed by everything that happened
during the week of June 23-30, 1843 and now it was time to sort it out.
Documentation is entered into the Nauvoo Municipal Court record
justifying Jo’s arrest in the first place. Then Jo makes a speech to the
eager Mormons who were excited to see their prophet safe in their town
again. The following day the court convenes to hear witness testimony
proving that Joseph Smith wasn’t guilty of treason against the State of
Missouri.

Joseph Smith and his arresting posse had made it safely back to Nauvoo.
It’s June 30<sup>th</sup>, 1843, the sun was shining, thousands of
people were in the streets greeting the prophet upon his return. The
Nauvoo Legion was out with their arms, the band was playing, Jo returned
to the loving embrace of his mother, first wife, Emma, and his children
who’d been tortured with uncertainty for over a week from when they
first learned he’d been arrested by Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds of
Illinois and Missouri respectively.

But now, Jo was in his kingdom, surrounded by his bodyguards, ready to
roam freely as his desires led. However, the week of multiple arrests by
multiple individuals created a tangled mess legally speaking. When Jo
was first arrested he attained a writ of habeas corpus for the Dixon
court, but that judge was out of town. The new writ in his hand was much
broader in that it granted the writ to be heard at any nearby court with
jurisdiction. Add into the chaos, Jo’s friend, Sheriff Campbell, had
arrested the sheriffs who’d arrested Joseph Smith, and they were given
to the custody of General Wilson Law of the Nauvoo Legion. So everybody
was in everybody else’s custody and the Nauvoo Legion had final say,
which Joseph Smith was commander-in-chief of the Nauvoo Legion. Further,
Jo was Mayor of Nauvoo and chief chairman of municipal court hearings,
meaning he would be the primary person to chair the hearing on whether
or not to grant his writ of habeas corpus. Seems like an ethical mayor
would recuse himself, were he in Jo’s position, but ethics and the due
process of law held no sway with a person like Joseph Smith.

Upon their arrival in town, Jo had the arresting sheriffs at his home
for a proper feast, Emma served them and a massive party of Jo’s most
trusted elites. The sheriffs were in hostile territory, in the custody
of the captive, dining in the belly of the beast. But the day was young.
They chose to begin sorting out the legal mess that very day. The
various documents were entered into the Nauvoo Municipal Court record,
beginning with the initial documentation from Governors Reynolds and
Ford of Missouri and Illinois respectively which led to the arrest of
Joseph Smith. Cyrus Walker was Jo’s legal counsel. Cyrus Walker was
well-known in Illinois as one of the foremost criminal defense lawyers.
Walker had been out campaigning for State Congress when Jo was arrested,
but agreed to represent Jo once he was promised Jo’s vote in the coming
election of 1843, which is a way of saying he had the Mormon voting bloc
on his side.

I’ll briefly read a few excerpts from the documents in order to
illustrate the defense that Jo and Cyrus Walker constructing against it.

First, the initial arrest and extradition warrant signed by the governor
of Missouri. And today I’ll be reading almost exclusively from vol 5 of
the Dan Vogel History of the Church. The documentation and court
proceeding go from pages 488 to about 630. As usual, I’ve done a lot of
reading so that you don’t have to.

> I, Thomas Reynolds, Governor of the State of Missouri, having full
> trust and confidence in the integrity and abilities of \[Sheriff\]
> Joseph H. Reynolds, do hereby constitute and appoint him as the agent
> of the said State of Missouri, to proceed to the State of Illinois,
> for the purpose of receiving from the proper authorities of that
> State, one Joseph Smith, jr., charged with treason by him committed
> against the State of Missouri, and as having fled from justice to the
> State of Illinois, and I do hereby authorize and direct said Joseph H.
> Reynolds to convey said Joseph Smith, jr., from the State of Illinois,
> and deliver him to the custody fo the sheriff of Daviess County, int
> the State of Missouri…
> 
> By the Governor,
> 
> THO\[MAS\] REYNOLDS

And the warrant for arrest and extradition from Governor Thomas Ford of
Illinois in compliance with the request from Governor Reynolds and the
Constitution.

> Whereas it has been made known to me by the executive authority of the
> State of Missouri, that one Joseph Smith, junior, stands charged with
> the crime of treason against the State of Missouri, and alleged that
> Joseph Smith, junior, has fled from the justice of the said State of
> Missouri, and taken refuge in the State of Illinois.
> 
> Now, therefore, I, Thomas Ford, Governor of the State of Illinois,
> pursuant to the constitution and laws of the United States and of this
> State, do hereby command you to arrest and apprehend the said Joseph
> Smith, junior, if he be found within the limits of the State
> aforesaid, and cause him to be safely kept and delivered to th3e
> custody of Joseph H. Reynolds, Esq., who has been duly constituted the
> agent of the said State of Missouri to receive the said fugitive from
> the justice of said State, he paying all fees and charges for the
> arrest and apprehension of said Joseph Smith, junior, and make due
> returns to the executive department of this State, of the manner in
> which this writ may be executed…
> 
> By the Governor,
> 
> THOMAS FORD.

And finally the writ of habeas corpus to which Sheriff Reynolds
submitted upon their entry into the city of Nauvoo when Jo was
transferred to the custody of the Nauvoo city marshal, his buddy from
the Kirtland years of the church, Henry G. Sherwood.

> I, Joseph Reynolds,… do hereby return this writ, with the body of

> 
> JOSEPH H. REYNOLDS

And now the defense Jo and Cyrus Walker constructed against the arrest.
A few of these points are fascinating, the first of which is simply
asinine and reveals how much the defense was grasping at straws to find
ANY flaw in the documentation.

\[T\]he arrest \[of Joseph Smith\], and the imprisonment consequent
thereupon, by said \[Sheriff Harmon T.\] Wilson, and afterwards by said
Joseph H. Reynolds, is illegal, and in violation of law, and without the
authority of law, as he is informed and verily believes, for the
following, besides other reasons, to wit.:

And here are the arguments they made:

1<sup>st</sup>, that the warrant for arrest was sworn out for Joseph
Smith junior, which is not the same person as our Joseph Smith because
he claimed to be going by Joseph Smith senior. Yes, Jo was known his
whole life as Jo jr., but when an arrest warrant was issued for him, he
decided he wanted to be called Joseph Smith Sr., because he had a 10
year old son named Joseph Smith III, or Joseph jr. in this case. That
was literally the leading argument, that the warrant was for the wrong
person because it was for Jo Smith Jr, instead of Sr, and therefore the
sheriffs had the wrong guy. Their warrant then would be for a
10-year-old kid who committed treason against the state of Missouri.
That would be like me murdering Eli Bosnick because of certain
aroma-related accusations, then an officer comes to arrest me and I tell
them that my dog is named Bryce Blankenagel, and I go by Daddy Bryce, so
he should arrest my dog instead.

2<sup>nd</sup>, that the warrant for arrest is defective because it
didn’t state explicitly that the executives of Missouri or Illinois
demanded the arrest. This is only true so far as Sheriff Wilson
apparently didn’t offer up the initial writ of arrest. This is patently
false. I just now read the warrants signed by Governor Thomas Ford and
Governor Thomas Reynolds and both of them demand the arrest and
extradition of Joseph Smith junior and appoint Sheriffs Reynolds and
Wilson to be the special agents to carry out said warrant. So the first
point of defense Jo and his counsel made was that the arrest warrants
were for the wrong guy, and the second point they made was factually
wrong. Cyrus Walker’s and Jo’s side of the court were not operating from
a strong position.

3<sup>rd</sup>, that the warrant didn’t allege any criminal indictments
against Jo. This is also factually wrong. Governor Reynolds’s warrant
specifically says Jo committed treason against the state and fled as a
fugitive, both factually accurate statements, and Governor Ford’s
request clearly states that Sheriff Reynolds is appointed to act as a
sheriff within the state of Illinois to carry out the legal process of
Missouri. Once again, Jo and his counsel were grasping at straws here.

4<sup>th</sup>, the warrant is defective and void because it “does not
show that any legal foundation was furnished by the executive of the
State of Missouri”. The reason that the crime of Treason is so broad and
ill-defined is because it can mean any number of treasonous acts. When
Jo caused the Nauvoo Expositor printing press to be burned down, that
was suppression of the right of the free press, thus an act of tyranny
and criminally treasonous. When Jo had his own army in Missouri and
waged war against the militia of Missouri, that was open treason against
the state. A president of the United States working with an enemy
foreign entity to win an election is technically treasonous. Treason is
more like an umbrella criminal activity that many different categories
of crimes can fall under. So, the state of Missouri merely alleged
treason on Jo’s part, but his defense is making the argument that
because specific treasonous acts were not enumerated in the arrest
warrant, that it’s void and defective. Once again, not a very strong
defense. It’s like if I killed Noah Lugeons because I hate his long
hair, and I was arrested for murder, and my defense was that the officer
arresting me didn’t specify that it was a hate crime against people with
long hair, therefore I should be allowed to go free. It’s hard to
believe that the guy writing this defense was known as the best criminal
defense lawyer in Illinois at the time.

5<sup>th</sup> just says “said supposed warrant is in other respects
defective and void” without providing any clarification whatsoever.

6<sup>th</sup> claims that Sheriff Reynolds from Missouri didn’t
actually have authority to arrest somebody in a state that wasn’t
Missouri, but he’d been appointed as a special agent by both state
governors so he did have jurisdiction to arrest Jo.

7<sup>th</sup> complaint claims the right of double jeopardy because Jo
had already been arrested in June of 1841 and December of 1842 on these
charges, but Jo had been let off on writs of habeas corpus in both of
those cases, both time released on technicalities in the law by judges
who were under his political thumb. He had the right to make the claim,
but he’d actually never seen a jury trial for the charges, so he’d never
even single jeopardied to be able to claim double jeopardy, so this
argument is another fail.

8<sup>th</sup> counterclaim states that Jo wasn’t a fugitive from
justice because he, “has not fled from the justice of the State of
Missouri, and he is not guilty, and has not been guilty of treason in or
against the state of Missouri.” Sheriff Reynolds was Jackson County
sheriff during the Missouri Mormon war of 1838 so he’d seen the treason
happen. This is like if I killed Heath Enwright in front of a cop
because I’m intimidated by tall people and my defense was “but no I
didn’t” when the cop arrested me. Like he was there, he saw it happen.
This point of defense Jo’s counsel was arguing is nonsense.

9<sup>th</sup> argument claims that Jo hadn’t been in Missouri for the
last 4 years and therefore couldn’t be a fugitive from justice. But he’d
literally bribed his guards while being transferred between jails in
order to escape their custody and flee to Illinois. He was definitely a
fugitive. The argument claims he hadn’t been in the state for 4 years,
but nowhere in the complaint does it try to argue that the statue of
limitations had been exceeded. But, I wouldn’t expect that treason
against a state of the union had a statue of limitations in the
19<sup>th</sup> century, I could be wrong on that, however.

And the final complaint by Jo’s counsel simply states that none of what
the Governors and Sheriffs had done was done so under the color of law
and therefore it was all defective and void. For all 10 of these
complaints, Jo and his counsel, Cyrus Walker, claimed that Joseph Smith
should be discharged from the custody of Sheriff Reynolds of Missouri
and allowed to go about his business as he saw fit.

Once all the paperwork was entered into the court record, the sun was
just beginning to set. The Mormons wanted to hear the prophet preach of
the persecution he’d suffered at the hands of the Missouri mobocrats
who’d arrested him. Jo was transferred to the custody of Henry G.
Sherwood, the Nauvoo marshal, and Sherwood let his prophet conduct
himself according to the dictates of his own desires.

An assembly of a few thousand Mormons gathered at the grove near the
temple to hear Jo’s sermon, which was recorded in the journals of
White-out Willard Richards and Billy Goat Wilford Woodruff. It was
synthesized together from their journals and included in the History of
the Church. Here’s what Jo told the thousands of Mormons. He starts with
his typical Jo grandiosity and charisma. Sermons like this after what
he’d just experienced reveal a small window into the mechanisms of his
charisma and why so many people loved him.

The rest of Jo’s speech relates what happened to him once he was
arrested, but we’ve already gone through all of that. He continues to
paint himself as the martyr of the Mormon cause, suffering religious
persecution and all the Mormons are being persecuted solely because they
are the one true religion. The violent rhetoric is peppered all
throughout the entire speech. This is a cry for war the next time Jo is
arrested. He concludes the speech with bringing up his legal counsel,
Cyrus Walker, who gave a few brief remarks. Jo finishes with this
paragraph.

> The lawyers themselves acknowledge that we have all power granted us

Jo was right, the Nauvoo court system was more powerful than any other
court in the state. The justification offered for these broad
privileges? Religious liberty. It was a kingdom and Jo was untouchable
as he riled up thousands of Mormons in preparation for war should
Reynolds and Wilson, or any Missourian, attempt to remove him or any of
his brothers from Nauvoo.

Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds, however, weren’t in the crowd to hear this
speech. Had they been there, they would see this violent rhetoric coming
from their prisoner and who knows what they would have done. Instead,
the sheriffs were headed to Carthage, one of the central hubs of
anti-Mormonism, to apply to a local militia leader there for permission
from the Governor to raise the Illinois State Militia to march into
Nauvoo and arrest Jo. This whole sector of the State was a powder keg
and Jo was a kid playing with matches.

Jo wasn’t sure where Governor Ford of Illinois would come down in his
alliances. Would Ford be sympathetic to the Mormons and not call out the
militia, or would he carry out his duties as Governor and bring in the
militia to affect the arrest he’d been requested by the Governor of
Missouri? Ford had not been favorable to the Mormons for the half of a
year he’d been in office, and Jo was in an irrational state of mind when
he said this.

> “I prophecy in the name of the Lord God that Governor Ford by granting
> the writ against me has damned himself politically and eternally. His
> carcass will stink on the face of the earth, food for the carrion crow
> and Turkey buzzard.”

Oddly, that prophecy was in Jo’s Nauvoo journal, but was removed from
the History of the Church when B.H. Roberts compiled it. I wonder why
that prophecy was cut from the record.

After Jo’s rousing speech, while the Sheriffs were on their day-long
horse ride to Carthage to call out the militia, the Mormons were ready
for a fight regardless of what happened. Blood and thunder, pistol and
sword, the Missourians would all go to hell if the Mormons had their
way. And, let’s just reiterate. Jo was a war criminal. Unquestionably
he’d committed treason against the state of Missouri and had fled
state custody by bribing his guards. He was wanted for crimes he’d
committed. He faced the death penalty in Missouri if he were ever tried.
But, because he was able to spin this as nothing but religious
persecution by tapping into the Mormons’ shared trauma from their time
in Missouri, the population of Nauvoo was even more galvanized to
protect the prophet from any harm. He’d prejudiced the populace. He’d
done exactly what a charismatic prophet is supposed to do in these
situations, lie, obfuscate, and remove any blame for his own actions
from himself. The crowd wanted any person who sought to oppress their
prophet dead.

It’s with this collective and individual mindset that the court convened
the next morning at 8 a.m. From the opening line in the History of the
Church we can already tell how this is going to play out.

> Saturday, July 1 \[1843\].—At 8 a.m., the Municipal Court met in the
> Courtroom. Present: William Marks, Acting Chief Justice, Daniel H.
> Wells, Newel K. Whitney, George W. Harris, Gustavus Hills, and Hiram
> Kimball, Associate Justices, to investigate the writ of habeas corpus.

This is the who’s who of Jo’s best friends and anointed elites. William
Marks, acting as chief justice because the Mayor, Joseph Smith, who
would regularly be the one presiding, was the person for whom the
hearing was being held. Then we have Daniel H. Wells. Wells wasn’t
actually a Mormon, but what they called a Jack-Mormon back then. Wells
was somebody who had a high-ranking position in many offices in Nauvoo.
He was an alderman, school warden, regent of the University of Nauvoo,
and was commissary general in the Nauvoo Legion. He was eventually
baptized into the church 2 years after Jo’s death and became Bloody
Brigham’s second counsellor in Utah, where he killed a lot of Native
Americans as a commanding officer of the Utah Nauvoo Legion. My point
being, Wells was one of the few members of Nauvoo government who wasn’t
actually a member of the church, but had an incredible amount of power
and had attached his name to the Mormons upon their arrival in Illinois
in 1839-40. The next associate justice listed, Newel K. Whitney, was the
first person to meet Joseph and Emma Smith upon their arrival into
Kirtland in February 1831. Whitney owned the store in town, the Smiths
lived with the Whitneys off and on throughout their entire time in
Kirtland. Newel Whitney has always been one of Jo’s right-hand men.
George W. Harris is the next name. Harris is another Mormon elite. When
Jo left Kirtland after the lawsuits and the church melted down out
there, Jo and Emma stayed with Lucinda and George Harris. That same
summer Jo married Lucinda Harris as his possibly third wife after Fanny
Alger. Harris had been there through thick and thin with the Mormons and
had given his wife to Joseph Smith. The next name is Gustavus Hills.
Hills hasn’t come up in our timeline and he’s not terribly important,
but he’d become an elder in the church in December of 1840 and was
therefore one of the in-group of Mormon elites. The final person listed
was also a Jack-Mormon, Hiram Kimball. Let’s not mix up Heber the
Creeper Kimball and Hiram Kimball. Heber the Creeper Kimball was the guy
who was best buddies with Bloody Brigham and converted around the same
time. From what I can tell, the Hiram Kimball who was associate justice
of this hearing isn’t actually related to Heber the Creeper Kimball,
unless they were distant cousins or something. Hiram Kimball was an
alderman, a member of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, and was assistant
adjutant general in the Nauvoo Legion. He was eventually baptized a few
weeks after this hearing began, but he wasn’t actually a member of the
church at this time, even though he was one of Jo’s trusted elites with
a lot of political power in Nauvoo government and the Legion. He was
eventually wounded in the battle of Nauvoo and died later on a Mormon
mission to the Sandwich Islands when the ship’s boiler exploded and
killed everybody on board.

That gives us a sense for who the people were that would be judging
whether or not Jo should be carried to Missouri. Like I said, just from
the names listed, we already know how this is going to play out. The
opening arguments witness list reveals exactly how this hearing would
play out. First to testify that Jo should be released on his writ of
habeas corpus were Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, P-cubed Parley P. Pratt,
Bloody Brigham Young, George W. Pitkin, Lyman Wight, and Hingepin Sidney
Rigdon.

I’ve read through all these testimonies. The substance of them is
reiterating what happened during the 1838 Mormon war in Missouri. We
covered that extensively in episodes 40-50 of this show so if you want a
refresher on that I’ll send you there in the backlog. The point of
rehashing everything they went through in Missouri was basically to say
you can’t arrest Jo because it’s not fair. We weren’t treated fairly in
Missouri, therefore we don’t have to abide by their laws and warrants
for arrest. How this functionally played out in the testimonies was by
claiming that Jo was treated as a military offender and therefore
treasonous, but since he wasn’t an actual sanctioned military leader of
an actual state-sanctioned militia, he wasn’t held to the standards of
military law, and therefore didn’t commit treason. This is a place where
Jo’s defense witnesses and the Missouri government would not disagree.
Jo had no military training or state sanction to lead a military, but he
had his own military, The Army of Israel, in addition to his own shadow
enforcement squad, the Danites, which he used to wage war on actual
state militias. That was treason. But it’s not treason if you simply say
it isn’t, right? Here’s how Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, Jo’s older
brother, put it in his testimony.

> I have not been absent from \[Joseph Smith\] at any one time, not even
> the space of six months since his birth, to my recollection, and have
> been intimately acquainted with all his sayings, doings, business
> transactions and movements, as much as any one man could be acquainted
> with another man’s business up to the present time, and do know that
> he has not committed treason against any State in the Union, by any
> overt act, or by levying war, or by aiding, abetting, or assiting an
> enemy in any State of the Union; and that the said Joseph Smith,
> senior, has not committed treason in the State of Missouri, nor
> violated any law or rule of said State,… and I do know that said Smith
> never bore arms, as a military man, in any capacity whatever, whilest
> in the State of Missouri or previous to that time; neither has he
> given any orders or assumed any command in any capacity whatever;

Hyrum also made the argument that Jo had been going by Joseph Smith sr
for 2 years by this point since Big Daddy Cheese had died in September
of 1841, giving voice to the first objection crafted by Jo’s counsel
that the warrant was for the wrong person and therefore had no legal
effect.

Hyrum continues to relate his side of the story in the Missouri-Mormon
war. It’s an interesting window into what it looked like behind closed
doors in the Mormon elite towns of Far West and Adam-Ondi-Ahmen during
the war, but we’re going to skip it as it isn’t really relevant. He also
tells of how the November court of inquiry went from the Mormon
perspective, as well as their struggles in Liberty Jail, their escape,
their journey to Illinois, and the struggles of their settlement in
Quincy and Nauvoo. Hyrum concludes with appealing to the sense of
mistreatment and unfairness the Mormons suffered during the entire
ordeal and the lack of the U.S. government to pay reparations for what
they’d suffered in being chased from their homes in Missouri.

P-cubed Parley Parker Pratt was the next to testify. He begins by saying
“that he fully concurs in the testimony of the preceding witness, so far
as he is acquainted with the same,”. Pratt goes on to relate his
perspective of the Missouri-Mormon war and also enters into the court
record his copy of the Extermination Order by Lilburn Boggs, titled
Missouri Executive Order 44, issued Oct 27, 1838.

One point added in by Pratt is something that is rather controversial
and by no stretch of imagination unbelievable. He related hearing the
stories of the Haun’s Mill Massacre while he was in the custody of some
of the people who’d committed the massacre. He adds some salacious
details. Here’s a trigger warning for the next 45 seconds of violence
and sexual assault.

Yeah I mean it probably happened. There’s no reason to believe it
didn’t. It’s just one of those realities when it comes to military
conflict. The next person to testify was George W. Pitkin. He reiterates
a number of the same points but adds a bit about the Mormon’s guns being
taken away, but they were guns that the Mormons had taken from the
Missouri militia in the first place, so there that. This is what he
said.

> About this time \[Joseph Smith\] received information that about forty
> or fifty “Yauger Rifles,” and a quantity of ammunition were being
> conveyed through Caldwell to Daviess county, for the use of the mob:
> upon which he deputized William Allred to go with a company of men and

This alone is a treasonable offense. If you have a private military that
marches out of your theocracy and seizes the arms of a state sanctioned
militia, you’ve now committed treason, regardless of whether or not your
private military has sanction. If this is a witness called on behalf of
defending Jo that there was no evidence to legally arrest and convey him
to Missouri to be tried for treason, this witness didn’t help his case.
But, to be clear, nobody in the court that day was in favor of Jo being
taken to Missouri. Every member of the judicial panel, nearly every
person spectating, Jo’s legal counsel, Cyrus Walker, Jo himself, nobody
there wanted Jo extradited.

Bloody Brigham Young was the next to testify. He repeats the same points
of the Missouri-Mormon war but adds an interesting detail because he was
the overseer of the Mormon removal from Missouri to Illinois.

> The witness also says that they \[Missourians\] compelled the brethren
> to sign away their property by executing a Deed of Trust, at the point
> of the bayonet, and that Judge Cameron stood and saw the Mormons sign
> away their property, and then he and others would run and kick up
> their heels, and said they were glad of it, and “we have nothing to
> trouble us now”. This Judge also said, “God damn them, see how well
> they feel now.” General Clark also said he had authority to make what
> treaties he pleased; and the Governor would sanction it.

This isn’t inaccurate. General Clark was the Missouri militia general to
whom the Extermination order was issued by Governor Boggs. This order
told General Clark to remove or “exterminate” the Mormons at all
hazards, but keep in mind the context in which Governor Boggs issued the
order. The Mormons had just aggressively attacked Captain Bogart at
Crooked River and two Mormon elites, Thomas B. Marsh and Doctor Sampson
Avard had defected and sworn out affidavits that the Mormons had a
shadow military known as the Danites. That’s why it says, “I have
received… information of the most appalling character, which changes
entirely the face of things, and places the Mormons in the attitude of
an avowed defiance of the laws, and of having made war upon the people
of the State… The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be
*exterminated, or driven from the State*, if necessary for the public
peace.” Boggs wasn’t wrong, the Mormons were an enemy of the Missourians
who’d waged open war on the militia, which the Mormons called a mob in
order to diminish the authority by which the Missouri militia operated
in their own consciences. The result of the Mormons waging war on
Missouri was that they completely got shafted on their land and property
once driven from the state. That was simply one of the consequences of
losing a war, they lost everything. At least they were allowed to live
and relocate which is something that can’t be said of most other wars
against non-European Americans at this time. But to also be fair, the
Mormons were the ones who did it first. Jo took something like 150
Danites to the houses of public officials in Missouri and forced them to
sign documents under duress, or as Brigham said, “at the point of the
bayonet”. They treated the Missourians one way then got offended when
the Missourians responded with similar force. They wanted it both ways.

Bloody Brigham’s testimony concludes with this absolute absurdity:

> The witness also stated that he never transgressed any of the laws of
> Missouri; and he never knew a Latter Day Saint break a law while
> there. He also said that if they would search the records of Clay,
> Caldwell, or Daviess counties, they could not find one record of crime
> against a Latter Day Saint, or even in Jackson county, so far as
> witness knew.

But the Mormons had transgressed the laws of Missouri and of the federal
government. All of the crimes Missouri charged them with when they held
Jo and his 5 boys in Liberty Jail and something like 60 other Mormon
elites in other jails while the state compiled the proper documentation
to bring a case, the Mormons had committed all of those crimes. Arson,
larceny, theft, robbery, treason, all of those crimes had been committed
by the Mormons, and by extension the leader of the Mormons.

The next testimony came from Lyman Wight. Wight was one of the craziest
of the Danites who was always ready for a fight. His testimony
reiterates everything the other witnesses had said only in greater
detail. He also adds about the Missouri election during which he was
elected to a Colonel of the Missouri militia and received a stipend from
Governor Boggs for his position. Wight adds the detail of his own
courageousness in the face of death when he was arrested with Jo and
friends outside Far West after they surrendered. The sham court martial
was held by General Lucas when he was able to get the Mormons to
surrender, General Lucas commanded General Doniphan, friend of the
Mormons, to execute Jo and his 5 friends in the public square of Far
West the morning after the surrender. When one of the captains of the
Missouri militia approached Lyman Wight to tell him of his fate, this
was what supposedly transpired.

> He returned… that night and took me aside and said, “I regret to tell
> you, your die is cast, your doom is fixed, you are sentenced to be
> shot tomorrow morning on the public square in Far West, at 8 o’clock.”
> I answered, “shoot and be damned.”
> 
> “We were in hopes,” said he, “you would come out against Joe Smith,
> but as you have not, you will have to share the same fate with him.” I
> answered, “you may thank Joe Smith that you are not in hell this
> night; for had it not been for him, I would have put you there.”

Always ready for a fight, Lyman Wight was a lion of the prophet. His
testimony concludes with explicit details of how Jo and friends bribed
the guards during their transfer to release them so they could run away
to the Mormon settlement in Quincy, Illinois. His testimony, like that
of nearly everybody else, reveals that Jo was, indeed, a fugitive from
justice of the State of Missouri. So far, none of the testimonies we’ve
discussed have done anything to exonerate Joseph Smith of any of the
crimes he was currently accused of. An objective jury would have used
these testimonies to convict Jo of all the crimes charged against him in
Missouri and vote to extradite him, but he wasn’t in an objective jury
trial by any stretch of imagination.

The next testimony was the final heard that day, and it was from
Hingepin Sidney Rigdon. Rigdon needs no introduction, but since he’s
been largely absent from the timeline for so many episodes, I’ll just
remind any new listeners that Sidney Rigdon was one of the most
important pieces of the puzzle to the success of early Mormonism. Had
Rigdon not converted to the sect in late 1830, just 8 months after the
Book of Mormon was published, and subsequently converted his
congregations to the church, it never would have survived as a religion.
He was Jo’s first counselor since the formation of the presidency of the
church and was called to be interim president of the church while Jo was
on Zion’s camp, his first military foray in 1834 when the Mormons were
first removed from Jackson County 4 years before the actual
Missouri-Mormon war. No other single person was responsible for the
success of the Mormon religion than Sidney Rigdon. Jo was responsible
for starting it, Rigdon was responsible for its success. Rigdon’s power
of oration was his single most defining characteristic and most useful
skill. His proclivities toward flourishing language and run-on sentences
means his testimony is by far the longest and most verbose, robbing 18
pages of volume 5 of the History of the Church.

Rigdon’s testimony adds details absent from every other testimony, but
nothing substantive and absolutely nothing that we need to discuss on
the show because we’re already over time for today’s show.

It had been a long day. Rigdon’s oration undoubtedly tired out all the
spectators and certainly the clerk of the court because what was said to
conclude the day’s hearing isn’t recorded beyond this little line:

> Messrs. \[Cyrus\] Walker, Patrick, Southwick and Backman (the counsel
> on my behalf) then respectively addressed the court, and they exhorted
> the Mormons to stand for their rights, stand or fall, sink or swim,
> live or die. Mr. Mason was counselor for Reynolds.

Whatever these lawyers said was never documented so we don’t get to hear
the counterarguments made by Reynolds’ counselor, Mr. Mason. Were I in
his shoes I would have said, are we serious right now? Alright Jo you’re
under arrest again and I’m executing you right now. You’re very clearly
guilty of EVERYTHING that Missouri wants to execute you for as all of
these witnesses have clearly stated on record. But, because this was a
kangaroo court with nothing but Mormons and Mormon sympathizers as the
judge, jury, and executioner, this was the finding after the first day
of testimonies.

> This day came the said Joseph Smith, senior, in proper person, and the
> said Joseph H. Reynolds \[Sheriff of Missouri\] having made return of
> said Writ of Habeas Corpus and produced the body of said Smith in
> pursuance to the mandate of said writ, and after hearing the evidence
> in support of said petition. It is ordered and considered by the court
> that the said Joseph Smith, senior, be discharged from the said arrest
> and imprisonment complained of in said petition, and that the said
> Smith be discharged for want of substance in the warrant upon which he
> was arrested as well as upon the merits of said case, and that he go
> hence without \[delay\].

And just like that, Jo was arrested. The Illinois Register of July 7,
1843 reports the proceeding as follows:

> The whole party made some stop at Nauvoo, where the Missouri agent
> says he was forced to go against his will. Smith and Walker then sued
> out a writ of habeas corpus from the Municipal Court of Nauvoo. The
> case of Smith, was brought before that court, which, after hearing a

> favor of Smith, that Court discharged him from imprisonment. Thus the
> matter now stands, The Executive of Illinois has so far performed the
> duty required by the Constitution and laws, and he will doubtless
> persevere in that course without deviation. 

Jo was free to go, but the fight was long from over. During this
hearing, Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson were in Carthage trying to raise
the local militia with the approval of the Governor to march into Nauvoo
and arrest Jo again. Jo was no idiot and sent Stephen Markham to
Carthage to get intel on their success and bring it back to Nauvoo as
soon as he could, and that’s where we’ll pick up next week.

In conclusion, I guess I’ll just say, when it comes to Mormon doctrine,
whether that’s polygamy, exaltation and the model of heaven, temple
ceremonies, priesthood ordinances, and myriad other points, the church
has completely shifted from what Joseph Smith first created. Everything
he put in place has somehow been changed, adapted, altered, updated,
removed, or completely forgotten. It’s nice to see something they kept
from the Jo years of the church. And what, pray thee, is it they’ve
preserved to this day? Wanting to have it both ways. They want to have
their cake and eat it too. When Joseph Smith said religious persecution,
that was the system of law trying to rein in a criminal empire. When
Joseph Smith said prophecy that only applied until it was untenable by
secular standards. When Joseph Smith says you must have 3 virgin wives
to enter the celestial kingdom, it’s a divine commandment until their
tax-exempt status is threatened then it’s put on hold until the end
times. When Brigham Young says people of African descent can’t have the
priesthood, it’s prophecy until BYU gets protested and a brand-new
temple will be empty. When they say religious freedom today it’s used as
an argument to oppress anybody that’s not cis-heterosexual. This hearing
we read through today illustrates that Jo was trying to pick and choose
what laws of an enlightened society he and his religion would follow,
then cry foul when those rules applied in ways that obstructed his
religious theocracy. Utah just appointed an old white guy returned
missionary to the Utah state liquor board and his religious convictions
somehow don’t constitute a conflict of interest. BYU can have a police
force with full access to legal records that other police departments
have, but when they’re forced to report their own statistics to state
law enforcement agencies it’s a fight in the courts. Religious liberty
was Jo’s defense to get out of the death penalty in this kangaroo court
and it’s the same argument used today to insulate the church from the
laws the rest of us abide by. When that church in St. George went up in
flames, those were state-employed firefighters on the scene, but the
church doesn’t pay taxes. They can’t interfere in politics without
threatening their tax-exempt status, but that’s only if they use “a
substantial portion” of their income to influence politics that they run
afoul of the Johnson Amendment and the federal tax code. They can still
make phone calls to their wealthy politician friends and ask for favors
which is something you can rest assured happens every day. They can make
land and regulation deals in nations that are avowed enemies of the
United States, paying off oligarchs to build their temple, but the money
exchanged lives under a shroud of darkness… because… religious freedom.

Religious freedom is a farce; it’s religious privilege. It was when
Joseph Smith used it to escape a justified death penalty in the 1840s,
it is today when the church uses it to ignore laws the rest of secular
society lives by so we can all function in a pluralistic society. Their
empire grows every day, they become more wealthy every hour than you or
I will become in ten lifetimes, they pay no taxes, they influence
politics in any way that might benefit them, they benefit from
everything this society has built and contribute absolutely nothing but
lies and thought-killing indoctrination. Joseph Smith and the church
today want everything and cry persecution when somebody says they can’t
have it both ways. When the history of Nauvoo Mormonism serves as the
roots of the modern church, I don’t see how we can expect anything
different than what we see today. This kangaroo court was purely under
Joseph Smith’s control and they were never going to send him to Missouri
to answer for his crimes. This wasn’t the first time this happened and
it wouldn’t be the last. Even though it wasn’t doctrinal, at least we
found one pattern Joseph Smith created that the church lives by to this
day.
