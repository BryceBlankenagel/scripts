Ep 147 – First They Came

On this episode, Governor Ford’s hands are tied. Sheriffs Reynolds and
Wilson, who’d arrested Joseph Smith, appeal to the Governor to call out
the state militia to rein in Jo. The Mormons sign petitions calling on
the Governor to never issue a warrant for arrest on any Mormons ever
again. The Mormons collect a packet of affidavits and statements to be
sent to Governor Ford, attempting to obstruct the wheels of justice from
grinding up the Prophet. After that, Jo has a curious little meeting
with some Potawatomie Chiefs and then calls Orson Hyde on a mission to
Russia.

Legal Counsel <http://patorrez.com/>

The July Nauvoo Municipal Court hearing had found that Joseph Smith
should be free to go. He had been arrested by Sheriff Reynolds and
Sheriff Wilson of Missouri and Illinois respectively and Jo’s legal
counsel, Cyrus Walker, drew up a writ of habeas corpus for the prophet
and filed a complaint against the warrants for arrest granted by the
Governors of Missouri and Illinois. Jo was throwing punches in the big
leagues here.

The court was chaired by justices all under Jo’s control; it was a
kangaroo court that never would have sent their prophet and mayor out of
the city to face the gallows in Jackson County, Missouri. At the most
basic interpretation, the entire point of this court was to hear whether
or not Jo was guilty of the crimes charged against him in Missouri. This
court was crafted for the sole purpose of circumventing the judicial
system in Missouri. The logic was that they would try Joseph Smith on
the Missouri charges in their own court, find him not guilty, have him
released on his writ of habeas corpus, then when he gets arrested again
and actually extradited to Missouri, he could make a case for double
jeopardy because the Nauvoo court had already found him not guilty, thus
undermining the federal court system. But if I kill John Dehlin while
he’s on a visit to Seattle and I get twelve of my podcaster friends
together in a room to say that I’m not guilty or that he deserved it,
that doesn’t exactly undermine the judicial system, it’s ignoring the
system. But that’s what Jo was trying to do. The Nauvoo Court system had
just enough legitimacy to be recognized by the state of Illinois, but at
the end of the day, everybody knew that it was a sham court that would
rubber stamp writs of habeas corpus for criminals in the city,
especially their criminal prophet.

Sheriff Reynolds was not pleased with the outcome. He sent a letter to
the Times Picayune out of New Orleans with his side of the story. He
recounts capturing Jo, then being captured by Jo’s posse. Then he says
this, from the 20 Jul 1843 number of the paper:

> At Nauvoo I was compelled, by writ of *habeas corpus*, in the nature
> of an attachment, to give up the Prophet to the municipal court. I
> refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the court, and after going
> through a sham *ex parte* trial, the court discharged Joe on the
> insufficiency of the warrant, and also, as they allege, on the merits
> of the case. Be it known, that ‘holy Joe’ is himself presiding judge
> of the very court by a quorum of which he was discharged. I then
> repaired to Gov. Ford, for aid to assist in recapturing Joe—the *Hon.
> Cyrus Walker* still following, to counteract my movements\! The
> Governor has taken the matter undner advisement, and what the result
> will be I do not know.

We’ll get into how Governor Ford responded to the kangaroo court
momentarily, but for now, Jo was free, but the fight was long from over.
The Sheriffs were currently in Carthage, trying to raise the local
platoon of the Illinois state militia so they could march into Nauvoo
with force and arrest Joseph Smith to be extradited. This option had
only a small window of possible outcomes.

Governor Ford could grant them permission to take a division of the
Illinois State militia. They could make it into town with that militia
and immediately be run out of Nauvoo by the far-superior Nauvoo Legion.
Then the Mormons would be in open defiance of state laws again like had
happened in Missouri.

The state militia could make it to Nauvoo and try to arrest Jo, but he’d
have intel way ahead of them and would be in hiding like he was for the
last 6 months of last year and they’d never catch him. Even if they did
catch him and put him under arrest, then what? How could a force of a
few hundred militiamen get the commanding officer of an army of a few
thousand armed men out of Nauvoo? It likely would have resulted in a
battle at Nauvoo between the Illinois militia and the Mormon militia,
then what?

Let’s forget all that and suspend all constraints. Say this militia made
it to Nauvoo, arrested Joseph Smith, then was able to make their way out
of Nauvoo without firing a shot, how far would they get from the kingdom
before a posse of Danites rode them down and rescued the prophet? Would
they even get across the Mississippi? This is how criminal empires work.
Everybody trying to rein in the kingpin follows all the rules, but the
kingpin doesn’t play by any set of rules and always has the advantage,
as long as his army is loyal.

Governor Ford of Illinois was no idiot. He knew the ramifications of
marching a state militia into Nauvoo, he wouldn’t grant permission this
time, but everybody involved didn’t know that yet and even Ford was
probably torn with what to do in real time.

In order to claim legitimacy of the Nauvoo court findings, a folder was
compiled with the writs of arrest and the complaint filed by Cyrus
Walker we read last week, along with a few new affidavits from Jo’s
legal counsellors and Jo himself, and all of it was sent to the Governor
with hopes he would see the Nauvoo court in a favorable light and not
call out the militia. On the other hand, we don’t know what Sheriffs
Wilson and Reynolds were telling the local militia in Carthage or what
they were saying to Governor Ford in order to persuade him to call out
the militia. Governor Ford was the plastic white matter network that was
keeping the peace between the Mormons on one side, and the officers of
the law trying to serve the due process of law on the other.

On the first day of the hearing, Jo had sent his close advisor and
confidant, Stephen Markham, to follow the sheriffs to Carthage and find
out what was going on. Markham returned the next day with the intel that
the sheriffs intended to call out the militia, and it was decided to
expedite the document collection process to send to Governor Ford.

The affidavit by Jo’s legal counsel is interesting. It includes his
chief lawyer, Cyrus Walker, and also Messrs. Patrick, Southwick, and
Wasson, who made their affidavit that Jo had been cordial and abiding by
the system of law the entire time he was in custody of the sheriffs. The
affidavit was made after a large congregation of Mormons had gathered in
the grove on the morning of Sunday July 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1843, during
which, “\[the counsellors\] spoke on the stand, stating that I \[JS\]
had subjected myself to the law in every particular, and had treated my
persecutors and kidnapers with courtesy and kindness, they also spoke on
the unlawful conduct of my enemies.” Their public speech wasn’t recorded
anywhere that I can find, but we can assume it was probably largely
similar to their affidavit, from which I briefly quote from pg 571-2 of
Vogel HoC vol 5.

This is an important detail. Joseph Smith had been responsible for
riling the Mormons up to violence in the past. He’d given his grand
speech in the grove after his safe return to Nauvoo telling the Mormons
to let loose blood and thunder if ever they are persecuted again. He had
a penchant for violent rhetoric and had capitalized on his arrest to
excite the religious persecution narrative he’d been cultivating with
the Mormons for over a decade by this point. It was necessary that the
record showed that Jo never called for violence against these sheriffs.

What’s the alternative though? The simple fact that Jo had to tell the
thousands of Mormons present to NOT hurt the sheriffs while they’re in
town reveals that they were likely in a state of mind where they would
have harmed the sheriffs if Jo hadn’t explicitly told them not to.
That’s rather notable to understand the general public tenor in which
these sheriffs were brought into Nauvoo under Jo’s control.

So, all these affidavits were compiled and sent to Governor Ford’s
office to show that the whole Missouri situation was dealt with in the
Nauvoo court and that Jo didn’t require extradition to Missouri for the
case. Additionally, Jo was able to cobble together a petition to the
Governor requesting he not issue any more writs of arrest against Jo,
which petition was signed by 150 Nauvoo citizens. Jo directed his
counselors and assistants to get the packet hand-delivered to Governor
Ford as soon as they could. The Mormons had to stay ahead of any
possible militia action raised by the Sheriffs if they were successful
in their petition.

Never forget that information travelled at the speed of a horse at this
time. During the Missouri-Mormon war in 1838, many events transpired as
a result of limited information and people acting on said limited
information. For example, Boggs signed the Mormon extermination order as
a result of hearing the Mormons had aggressively attacked Captain Bogart
at Crooked River. The reports had come to Boggs that nearly every
Missouri militiaman had been killed by the Mormons, when only 2 had
actually been shot. But, when the bullets started flying, all the
Missouri militiamen scattered in all directions, each thinking their
platoon had been slaughtered. Then each one of these guys went to the
nearest town they could find and told people of the battle they’d just
survived, reporting dozens of casualties. It was inaccurate intel, but
Boggs acted on it by signing the extermination order. Had he waited a
few days for proper intel to reach him, Boggs may not have acted so
hastily and the history of the conflict may look significantly
different.

The lack of immediate communication forced the Mormons and Joseph Smith
to act quickly and deliberately, they didn’t know if a militia was on
its way to Nauvoo, they had no idea how Governor Ford would react to the
events following Jo’s arrest, they chose to act defensively and quickly
instead of being blindsided like had happened in Missouri with the
Haun’s mill massacre and the twin Mormon cities surrendering.

Stephen Markham had new intel that scared Jo.

> Colonel Markham returned from Carthage in the evening, and reported
> that on his arriving at Carthage, he found that Reynolds and Wilson
> had filed their affidavits, that he (Markham) had with armed forces
> taken me out of their hands at the head of Elleston Grove; and that
> they had also got up a petition, which was signed by the inhabitants
> of Carthage, and sent it to Governor Ford by the hands of Reynolds and
> Wilson, requesting him to raise a posse comitatus, and they would come
> to Nauvoo and take me; they were to start by the mail early this
> morning, and Markham requested Jacob Backenstos to go with the mail to
> Governor Ford, and request him to suspend all proceedings, until
> documents would be got to show the true state of the case.

When Jacob Backenstos tried to accompany the mails, he hired a local
Carthage carriage driver to take him to Quincy to meet with Governor
Ford. The carriage rider was told by Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson the
intent of Backenstos and refused to take him to Springfield. Instead,
Backenstos was forced to go to another guy in town and hire a horse to
ride out behind the mails. Everything here was reactionary, everything
the Sheriffs did was proactive to get Jo back into their custody;
everything the Mormons were doing was to simply impede the progress of
the sheriffs and the militia posse they called for.

With Stephen Markham bringing back this intel and Jacob Backenstos on
his mission to tell the Governor to halt all action until they had all
the information, Jo decided to take a proactive step. He called the
twelve together to form a special counsel to spread the word that Jo was
being persecuted again. The apostles called together all the elders they
could gather to send them on a special mission to rally the Mormons and
tell them of what had transpired in the previous week. There were still
a lot of people who’d possibly received news reports that Jo had been
arrested, but weren’t privy to the Nauvoo municipal court ruling that
let Jo go free, or weren’t aware that an Illinois militia could be
knocking on Nauvoo’s doorstep any day now.

> Elders B. Young, O. Hyde, P. P. Pratt, John Taylor, Geo. A. Smith,
> Wilford Woodruff, and Willard Richards met at the Grove with the
> Elders, and it was decided that the following Elders go on a special
> mission to the following counties in the State of Illinois:--
> 
> Elijah Reed and Jesse Hitchcock, Adams and Pike.
> 
> Salmon Warner and Jeremiah Curtis, Calhoun and Jersey.
> 
> John Murdock, Vermillion
> 
> John L. Butler, Hamilton.
> 
> Etc.

82 Elders in total going to 66 different locations throughout Illinois
to spread the word on what had happened, and, of course, to tell them to
be ready should Illinois play out like Missouri had just 5 years prior.
They set out on their mission the evening of the 3<sup>rd</sup> of July,
some of which is recounted in the History of the Church.

The following day was a big one. The 4<sup>th</sup> of July was always a
big celebration for the Mormons. Fueling their patriotic spirit was the
so-called persecution their prophet had just suffered the week previous.
Somewhere from 10 to 15 thousand people gathered at the grove near the
temple to hear an oration by the prophet and his assistants, food was
served, drinks were had, a party ensued, and speeches were properly
delivered. Also, Jo told the people that a new petition was circulating
and he wished all to sign it, calling for the Governor to not arrest
Joseph Smith or the Mormons ever again. This was similar to the petition
signed by 150 people two days prior, but this petition was instead
signed by upwards of 900 people calling on the governor to stay his
judicious hand. This new petition was expedited to Ford the following
day.

Put yourself in Governor Ford’s position. You have the Governor of
Missouri calling for one of your citizens to be arrested and extradited
to face criminal charges including conspiracy and treason against the
union. Then you have the sheriffs who arrested him telling you that they
need you to call out the state militia to bring Jo in. Then, on the
other hand, you have petitions with over 1000 signatures, along with a
packet of court proceedings clearing Jo’s name, urging you to not follow
through with Governor Reynolds of Missouri’s arrest and extradition
warrants. What do you do? This was Governor Ford’s response to this
flood of petitions and affidavits landing on his desk.

> EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT

> THOMAS FORD

He did what a Governor is supposed to do, take a back seat and wait
until more information comes. But the question then is, was this the
action that the situation warranted, or was there something more he
could have done?

Look, Governor Ford’s hands were kinda tied at this point. He didn’t
have any good options allowed within the system, because Jo didn’t
operate by the dictates of the system everybody else followed. The
Governor had to act within the parameters of his office and the laws of
Illinois and the federal constitution, but Jo had a bad habit for
breaking those systems. How do you stop flagrant abuses of the legal
system, while still using the legal system to stop said abuses? The fact
of the matter is that Governor Ford had a limited tool kit to work with.
He had sending special agents, and calling out the militia as his only
two reasonable options. If the special agents couldn’t get Jo
extradited, which Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson didn’t, the only
remaining option was either indifference, or radical escalation with
military force. The escalation was a final resort, like punishing a
person who double parks their car by blowing it up; but Jo was
double-parking his T-90 tank here. Governor Ford didn’t want a religious
military conflict on his hands because he knew that the Nauvoo Legion
was under his control legally speaking, but they would stop at nothing
to defend their prophet. The system of law simply was not equipped to
deal with a Nauvoo Joseph Smith. So, Ford opted for the least resistant
option of sending his own special agent to find out exactly what the
hell was going on. Once he had solid intel, he could act with as much
pragmatism as a state governor should.

As stated by Governor Ford himself, he was much abused for his hands-off
approach to Joseph Smith and the Mormons at this time. The Mormons
thought Ford should treat the situation with more tolerance and latitude
as his predecessor, Governor Carlin, had done. Non-Mormons thought he
was being too soft on the criminal empire; he just didn’t have any easy
options. However, collecting more information and acting upon the new
trustworthy intel is all well and good if this is the only thing going
on. But Jo had many more irons in the fire to ensure his religious
revolution. The blueprints had been drawn up, Talos was being
constructed, the Mormon uprising seemed an inevitability in Jo’s mind
because it was the will of God. Each ally he could make along the way
would only strengthen his military and further ensure his success as the
Yankee Mohamet, as popular media had labeled him.

In view of scorching the earth and building his theocracy on the ruins,
Jo had a curious meeting, which was recounted by one of his close
friends who attended the meeting, Wilford Woodruff, in his own journal.
Before the details of the meeting between Jo and these gentlemen who
called on him, a little historical background to preface it.

American expansionism was a controversial issue of the 1830s and 40s.
One of the primary reasons Andrew Jackson was so highly revered, and
thus elected as a populous president, was his violent hatred of, and
strategic dealings with, Native Americans. Jackson had famously cobbled
together Native tribes to war with other native tribes who were
resilient to American imperialism. The term “racist” doesn’t begin to
describe the viciousness with which Jackson ruled American politics. One
of his campaign promises was to “civilize” the native populations and
remove those who didn’t agree to being “civilized” in the
European-American sense. He was elected in November of 1828, took office
in January 1829, and gave his first State of the Union address on
December 8, 1829.

Just 6 months after that State of the Union address by Andrew Jackson,
he signed the Indian Removal Act to break apart the Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Seminole, Cherokee, Muscogee, and various other loosely confederated
tribes in the southeastern United States, forcing them to relocate.
Jackson’s successor, Martin Van Buren, was largely responsible for
putting the Removal Act into effect after the major Seminole wars had
removed those tribes in 1832. Beginning in 1836, the Trail of Tears
began, which sort of ran until 1850. The Indian Removal Act, Trail of
Tears, and the larger idea of colonialism which created these, is truly
the darkest stain on American history, possibly only taking second place
to the African slave trade contemporary with these events. These were
atrocities.

A historian in 2004 cobbled together dozens of stories from the Trail of
Tears and published them in a book titled “Family Stories From the Trail
of Tears”. This book included old letters, family reflections, and
secondhand accounts of what took place. You’ll find a link in the show
notes, but here’s a small sampling:

The Indian Removal Act authorized the American Militia to relocate over
15,000 Natives west of the Mississippi. Of those 15,000, some estimates
say only half survived the Trail of Tears. What’s even more concerning
is that the Trail of Tears was just the boil-over point. European
colonialism was running at a constant rate throughout the entire
settlement and expansion era of America beginning in the early to
mid-1600s. Native tribes were constantly being exterminated and
relocated. Some would resist, others would confederate with other tribes
during their resistance, but all were put down. Some would sign treaties
which were later violated by the government, others were never offered
that option. This rolling boil was the constant for roughly two
centuries by the time Joseph Smith and Mormonism became a thing, but the
Indian Removal Act and the resulting Trail of Tears was the boil-over
point that accelerated colonialism in America from that time forward.
For the entire history of Mormonism, the Mormons always benefitted from
Natives being removed from their lands. When they were settling in
Missouri beginning in the early 1830s, they were only able to afford the
land because the government had seized those lands from Natives and were
selling it off for almost nothing. Similarly, Commerce, Illinois, which
later became Nauvoo when the Mormons got the Nauvoo Charter
rubber-stamped through the state legislature, was an area of diverse
native settlements less than half a century before the Mormons put down
roots there. The 20,000 acres of land they purchased in the Iowa
territory was highly disputed and known as “the half-breed tract,” an
area made possible for European-American settlement because of treaties
the Government had signed with natives and later violated by
exterminating them.

Beyond all of that, the Book of Mormon itself was written by Joseph
Smith as a history of the Native Americans in order to Christianize the
natives the way many religions were doing contemporary with the Mormons.
If the Book of Mormon actually accomplished its initial intent, the
Native Americans who read it would convert to Christianity and follow
the prophet to overthrow the American government and build Zion, the New
Jerusalem on the American Continent so the earth would be renewed and
receive its paradisiacal glory. That’s still a central article of faith
of Mormonism. The first missionary effort was explicitly to proselytize
to the Native Americans who’d recently been removed to a small town
outside Jackson County, Missouri, where the mission was a complete and
utter failure. From its inception, Mormonism has always benefitted from
American imperialism.

So, why was this history and culture check necessary? Well, the meeting
Jo had that I used as a jump-off point to discuss this subject was with
some Pottawattamie chiefs. As recounted by Wilford Woodruff in his
journal, this is how the meeting transpired between Jo and the chiefs:

> \[O\]n the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of July, 1843, President Joseph Smith
> and several of the Twelve met those chiefs in the court-room, with
> about twenty of the Elders. The following is a synopsis of the
> conversation which took place as given by the interpreter.
> 
> The Indian orator arose and asked the Prophet if the men who were
> present were all his friends. Answer, \[“\]yes.\[“\]
> 
> He then said, “we as a people have long been distressed and oppressed,
> we have been driven from our lands many times; we have been wasted
> away by wars until there are but few of us left. The white man has
> hated us and shed our blood, until it has appeared as though there
> would soon be no Indian left. We have talked with the Great Spirit,
> and the Great Spirit has talked with us; we have asked the Great

> that he had raised up a great prophet, chief and friend, who would do
> us great good, and tell us what to do; and the Great Spirit has told
> us that you are the man (pointing to the Prophet Joseph.) We have now
> come a great way to see you, and hear your words, and to have you to
> tell us what to do. Our horses have become poor traveling, and we are
> hungry; we will now wait and hear your words.”

The Potawatomi were yet one more tribe who suffered as a result of the
Indian Removal Act. They had their own trail of tears, known as the
Potawatomi “Trail of Death” in 1838. This trail began in Northern
Indiana, an area known as Twin Lakes, passed all the way through Indiana
on a southwestern route, straight through Illinois crossing the
Mississippi at Quincy, through Missouri from east to west passing
Independence, and then just over the border of Kansas to a town called
Osawatomie. There was just shy of 1,000 Potawatomi Natives that were
exterminated and official numbers list the death toll over 40 people,
which you can be sure is a wildly understated number if it was anything
like the Trail of Tears happening the same year.

Whenever we discuss how much the Mormons suffered during their
extermination from Missouri to Illinois in late 1838 to early 1839, it’s
worth noting that they at least retained possession of some of their
land to be sold, retained the majority of their personal effects, and
most importantly, they were allowed to live and migrate to Illinois
under their own power and authority. When we compare it to what was
going on everywhere else in the country with Native tribes being
exterminated in the genocidal definition of the term, the Mormons got
off pretty easy because they were white Christians. The Natives were
killed, exterminated, and brutally removed from their lands, resulting
in genocide, at the hands of frustrated white European Christian
colonialists who wanted the Natives to build houses with white-picket
fences and send their kids to western-culture schools and convert to
their religion. When the natives refused to give up the culture and
ritualism they’d been living for thousands of years, and the land they’d
been living on for just as long, or even if they did agree to becoming
“civilized,” they were killed or moved where Europeans weren’t
settling at that very moment, only to be removed or killed again once
frontier expansion reached the next reservation.

While we’ve only ever just mentioned the plight of the Natives in this
show during our timeline, we should always recognize that this is the
background upon which our historical timeline is laid. The plight of the
Natives will factor more heavily into our timeline once we reach the
Utah years.

With that in mind, the question is, why would these chiefs be meeting
with Joseph Smith? If we go by Wilford Woodruff’s reporting of what he
remembered the interpreter said, (you see how many margins of error I
had to factor into that sentence), it was because their Great Spirit had
led them to meet with a Prophet who the Great Spirit had raised up who
would help them and tell them what to do. Any time that Native Americans
were willing to reach out to a paleface for help, you know they truly
had no other options.

Just consider what they may have heard about Joseph Smith that led them
to ask for this meeting. They were living on the Native reservation just
across the Kansas state line from Jackson County Missouri, Joseph Smith
and the Mormons were the talk of everybody in Missouri. What might they
have heard about this crazy bastard in the far-off land of Nauvoo? Jo
had raised his own personal armies in multiple states, he’d flaunted the
laws of every state he ever lived in, he’d committed treason against the
constitution, he’d gathered a diverse group of people and had
successfully established an immigration effort that was funneling
thousands more Europeans into his kingdom on the Mississippi. He’d done
all of these things while ignoring every system of law he’d ever fallen
under, and yet had never been killed for his actions. Every time a
Native chief, or group of chiefs, had ever tried anything like what Jo
was able to do, they’d been subjugated, massacred, and removed from
their lands by the government. I shouldn’t have to say it so obviously,
but Jo was able to do all of that because he was a white Christian guy
with friends in high places. The Potawatomie tried to resist the forged
treaties of resettlement but were answered with violence by General
Tipton of the Indiana militia, who surprise attacked their settlement
under the guise of negotiation discussions. Once the group had
surrendered, General Tipton burned their settlement to the ground,
destroyed their crops, and killed most of their livestock to ensure that
they wouldn’t make any attempt to resettle.

The fact of the matter is, Native Americans couldn’t do what Jo did
because they were considered second-class citizens by the government and
the culture that was imposed upon them. They were here for thousands of
years before the genocidal slave-trader Columbus ever set sail, we must
never forget that. What else could they do but seek the counsel of a
white savior who hadn’t been killed when he’d done exactly what their
friends and fellow chiefs had done and been killed for it? Here’s Jo’s
response to them after understanding why they’d called upon him for this
meeting, once again from the journal of Wilford Woodruff.

> The Spirit of God rested upon the Lamanites, especially the orator.
> Joseph was much affected and shed tears; he arose and said unto them,
> “I have heard your words; they are true, the Great Spirit has told
> you the truth. I am your friend and brother, and I wish to do you
> good; your fathers were once a great people, they worshiped the Great
> Spirit, the Great Spirit did them good, he was their friend, but they
> left the Great Spirit, and would not hear his words or keep them. The
> Great Spirit left them, and they began to kill one another, and they
> have been poor and afflicted until now.
> 
> The Great Spirit has given me a book, and told me that you will soon
> be blessed again. The Great Spirit will soon begin to talk with you
> and your children; this is the book which your fathers made; I wrote
> upon it; (showing them the Book of Mormons) this tells me what you
> will have to do. I now want you to begin to pray to the Great Spirit.
> I want you to make peace with one another, and do not kill any more
> Indians; it is not good; do not kill white men, it is not good; but
> ask the Great Spirit for what you want, and it will not be long before
> the Great Spirit will bless you, and you will cultivate the earth and
> build good houses like the white men; we will give you something to
> eat and to take home with you.”
> 
> When the Prophet’s words were interpreted to the chiefs, they all said
> it was good. The chief asked, “How many moons would it be before the
> Great Spirit would bless them?” He told them not a great many.
> 
> At the close of the interview, Joseph had an ox killed for them, and

> satisfied and contented.

That was the respite Jo offered to these Native chiefs, more of what
they’d suffered for decades before Jo had his own city and army. More
white European Christian colonialism. If they just stop killing each
other and all the white folk that were taking their land, the Great
Spirit would bless them. But every time they tried that they were
squashed without resistance. Every time they tried to resist
European-American expansionism, they were still squashed, but with
resistance and scores of fallen warrior brothers. They could either
accept their fate and make the marches demanded of them by the
government, or they could resist and be killed, and still make those
same marches, only in smaller numbers having watched their family
members be cut down with swords and bullets. At least Jo gave them some
meat and fresh horses for the 650 mile journey back to the reservation
in Kansas. That, and a vacuous promise that their suffering would be
over and the Great Spirit would bless them in “not a great many moons.”

The fact of the matter is that the dynamics of Native and
European-American relations had shifted significantly in the 13 years Jo
had been prophet. He wrote his Book of Mormon to Christianize the
Natives while Andrew Jackson was on the campaign trail. 13 years and an
Indian Removal Act later and Native American lands were becoming
increasingly a thing of the distant past and location. Had Jo been
granted this audience in the early 1830s he may have been more readily
equipped to forge an alliance with Native tribes. But, by 1843, the
possibility of alliances with Native Americans was so far from his mind,
making the initial intent of the Book of Mormon a mere fascination of
his early ministry, long-since abandoned in lieu of theocracy building.
But, Jo was smart enough to leave the door open to a possible
collaboration in the future, should the Potawatomie prove to be useful
to him.

There is another iron Jo had in the fire that’s worth mentioning that
was starting to get near proper forging temperature. For examining this
iron, we turn to the expose by Joseph H. Jackson of 1844. As a quick
recap, Jackson had joined the Mormons to gain Jo’s favor in order to
expose the Mormon empire. Jo had sent Jackson on a mission to Missouri
to break Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell out of prison and finish off the
Boggs job, a mission he’d failed. Jackson is beginning to figure heavily
into our timeline and has been an ancillary focus for the last 5 or so
episodes. A salacious detail in his expose pamphlet reveals some
much-deeper plans for properly arming Talos with some real
empire-breaking firepower. But first, a curious little line in the
History of the Church for July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1843:

> About 1 a.m. Messrs. Walker, Patrick, Southwick, Markham and Lucien
> Woodworth started for Springfield, carrying with them the affidavits,
> petition, and the doings of the Municipal Court.

This was to take all the documents of the hearing to Governor Ford.
Here’s the curious line:

> At a very early hour people began to assemble at the Grove, and at 11
> o’clock near 13,000 persons had congregated, and were addressed in a
> very able and appropriate manner by Elder O\[rson\] Hyde, who has
> recently been appointed on a mission to St. Petersburg, Russia.

Russia? What’s this about? When I was a kid in the church in Utah, I
remember one of my neighbors was a travelling patriarch who made
frequent trips to Russia to give patriarchal blessings, but I never
thought about how much of a presence the church has there now and what
the history of it is. Turns out the first Russian convert was baptized
in 1895; Orson Hyde never made this mission to St. Petersburg. It wasn’t
until 1989 that the church began an earnest missionary effort in Russia
and after lobbying for a few changes in law and getting nationally
recognized as a Russian-authorized religion, the Vyborg congregation was
established in February of 1990. Then apostle, Rusty Nelson, dedicated
the first Russian stake in Moscow in June 2011. This proposes an
interesting question, what interest could Joseph Smith possibly have in
Russia, and therefore call one of his most-trusted apostles on a
specific mission there? Jo never did anything that wasn’t out of
self-interest; how could his personal goals be served by a mission to
Russia, which somehow were never revisited by the Brighamite church
until more than half a century after his death?

From page 30 of his August 1844 expose, beginning with referencing Jo’s
campaign for President of the United States:

> The world is generally aware of the fact, that Joe Smith was a
> candidate for the Presidency. This has excited universal contempt and
> merriment; for no one conceived that Joe had any idea of his own

Joseph had escaped the legal system once again and he had plenty of
future plans to affect his religious revolution. Whether it was banding
together Native American tribes to fight for him, raising the numbers of
his own personal army to be able to contend with American militias, or
to align with the Russian emperor once elected POTUS to build
steam-powered submarines to overthrow the powers that be, Jo had a lot
of hot irons in the fire. He proved himself untouchable by legal
standard practices and his aspirations knew now bounds. Joseph Smith
illustrates to us that the system is created to protect everybody when
we all live under it, but certain people exist that the system is simply
ill-equipped to deal with. Jo broke boundaries, he did things a
different way than most, he wouldn’t be bound by the system of laws.
Everything we’ve discussed in the past 8 episodes really illustrates
that his assassination in 1844 was years overdue and perfectly deserved.
