Ep 149 – D\&C 132 Pt. 2 the ConText

On this episode, we dive into the historical context of the polygamy
revelation (D\&C 132). We discuss the plight of Emma with Jo’s reckless
libido. We cover the historical foundation for William and Jane Law
possibly brokering a sex-swap deal with Emma and Joseph Smith, as well
as their later denials of such scandalous accusations. The stories of
Sarah and Maria Lawrence & Emily and Eliza Partridge are told through
the lens of some of the foremost historians of the field, reconstructed
from firsthand accounts.

Now that we’ve reviewed the text of D\&C 132, the polygamy revelation,
let’s discuss the context. A lot can be said and much more has been
written about Nauvoo polygamy. Some historians have made it their sole
purpose to document and understand everything that happened when it came
to Mormon elites practicing polygamy throughout the first half of the
1840s. It’s a controversial subject. A few historians have tried to make
the case that Joseph Smith never practiced polygamy and that it was just
his Mormon elite cohorts who were practicing spiritual wifery. But
that’s nonsense which requires ignoring dozens of first-hand
contemporary sources which corroborate polygamy by Joseph Smith and his
closest acolytes. As far as historians can tell, it happened, so the
question is, what did it look like? How was it practiced? What were the
reactions of people when the doctrine was revealed to them?

We’ve explored some of these questions as the topic of polygamy has come
up in our timeline. It’s not a simple subject and the idea of sharing
spouses was so incredibly contrary to the Victorian Protestant ideals of
the standard model of a nuclear family that polygamy required
persuasion, coercion, and upon acceptance, the utmost secrecy, which was
repeatedly built into the text of 132 itself.

The practice of polygamy had commenced years before the actual text of
D\&C 132 was dictated. It required verbal communication of the idea, and
the scriptural justification of it, to those who would be initiated, but
having an actual revelation which could be presented certainly helped to
elevate the practice, thus legitimizing any proposal that Mormon elite
men would propose. The tradeoff, however, was that there now existed a
paper trail, removing any chance of plausible deniability. The existence
of a paper revelation on polygamy factored heavily into the criticisms
raised by the Nauvoo Expositor which led to Jo and Hyrum’s deaths less
than a year after the revelation was dictated.

For today, I’m going to be relying heavily on some of the foremost
historians of polygamy. Polygamy falls outside any field of knowledge
that I have, and frankly it falls outside my specific field of interest,
which is why we’ve spent comparatively little time on it with respect to
political, military, and criminal aspects in Nauvoo Mormonism. Polygamy
was an ever-present cloud hanging over Nauvoo and the practice of it
influenced many decisions. It’s an important piece to the Nauvoo
Mormonism history puzzle, but as a standalone subject, it’s a
theological issue which doesn’t particularly interest me. That’s not to
denigrate polygamy’s importance, only to reveal personal preferences. If
polygamy, as a standalone subject, interests you, I’d recommend
listening to Year of Polygamy podcast if you haven’t already. If you
listen to it in conjunction with this show, your understanding of
polygamy and how it impacted Nauvoo Mormonism will be much more complete
and richer. Besides, it’s one of the best Mormon history podcasts out
there and spectacularly well done.

With that said, let’s get into the historical context of the revelation
and practice. By July 1843, Jo had about 2 dozen wives, most of which
were probably unknown to Emma, first spouse to Jo of over 15 years. The
portion of the text from D\&C 132 we discussed last week will be coming
into focus today. Verse 51 and 52 say:

> 51 Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid,
> Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay
> herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto
> her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham,
> and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and
> sacrifice.
> 
> 52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been
> given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me;
> and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be
> destroyed, saith the Lord God.

Verse 54 is where it commands Emma to “abide and cleave unto my servant
Joseph, and to none else.” Let’s get into this, what does it mean? The
presence of these passages has caused some discord among historians with
how to interpret the historical record. There may be evidence that a
deal was brokered between Jo and Emma on equal rights, that she may have
agreed that Jo could have wives if she could take another husband. No
documentation exists that would unquestionably verify this, just old
reminiscences of people. This possible “equal rights” deal has to do
with Emma and a guy named William Law, who is controversial as a figure
of Nauvoo Mormonism, especially given his role as a primary publisher of
the Nauvoo Expositor, which led to Jo and Hyrum’s deaths.

A contemporary source for this possible polyandry comes from William
Clayton, Jo’s primary scribe in Nauvoo. His journal entry for 23 June
1843 says this:

> This A.M. President Joseph took me and conversed considerable
> concerning some delicate matters. Said \[Emma\] wanted to lay a snare
> for me. He told me last night of this and said he had felt troubled.
> He said \[Emma\] had treated him coldly and badly since I came…and he
> knew she was disposed to be revenged on him for some things. She
> thought that if he would indulge himself she would too.

If Jo would indulge himself, she would too. For further detail on this
possible deal, we must turn to the Joseph H. Jackson expose of 1844,
after Jo and Hyrum’s deaths. Remember, Joseph H. Jackson was the guy who
joined the Mormons under false pretenses to expose Joe Smith and the
deluded religious sect. He’d gained Jo’s favor and Jo called on Jackson
to carry out a mission in Missouri to break Pistol Packin’ Porter
Rockwell out of prison and finish of the botched Lilburn Boggs
assassination, neither of which he was able to accomplish. Jackson’s
expose is very controversial and divisive among Mormon historians, but
this is what he tells of the situation between Jo and Emma Smith and
William and Jane Law. It’s a bit of a long read but it’s so full of
little goodies that we have to deal with.

> It was shortly after the adventure I have related above,… that Joe
> informed me, in conversation, that he had been endeavoring for some

> seduce Emma, in order to justify his own proceedings with Law's wife,
> but that now he contradicted himself by expressing so much confidence
> in Law. To get out of his dilemma, he said that the truth was, Emma
> wanted Law for a spiritual husband, and that she urged as a reason
> that as he had so many spiritual wives, she thought it but fair that
> she should at least have one man spiritually sealed up to her, and
> that she wanted Law, because he was such a "sweet little man." -- He

> himself, for I would have nothing to do with such things; but
> remarked, that if all parties were agreed, that he and Law had better
> swap wives. To which he replied that that was all Emma wanted. 

It wasn’t long after this reported occurrence that William Law was
excommunicated from the church, formed his own branch, published the
Nauvoo Expositor, and Jo and Hyrum were both dead. Law was also first
counselor in the church presidency and aide-de-camp to the
lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion. William Law was a lifelong
friend of Emma Hale Smith Bidamon. He remembered this time as a man of
nearly 80 years old, when he was living in Wisconsin. This came in the
form of 3 letters by William Law when he responded to allegations of
this wife-swap proposal in Wilhelm Wymetal’s 1886 expose:

> On page 108 you speak of "swapping wives," and state that you have it
> from one who knows. Now let me say to you that I never heard of it
> till I read it in your book. Your informant must have been deceived or
> willfully lied to you. Joseph Smith never proposed anything of the
> kind to me or to my wife; both he and Emma knew our sentiments in
> relation to spiritual wives and polygamy; knew that we were immoveably
> \[sic\] opposed to polygamy in any and every form; that we were
> so\[,\] subsequent events proved. The story may have grown out of the
> fact that Joseph offered to furnish his wife, Emma, with a substitute
> for him, by way of compensation for his neglect of her, on condition
> that she would forever stop her opposition to polygamy and permit him
> to enjoy his young wives in peace and keep some of them in her house
> and to be well treated, etc.
> 
> The great mistake of my \[life was my\] having anything to do with
> Mormonism. I feel \[it to\] be a deep disgrace and never speak of it
> when I can avoid it; for over forty years I have been almost entirely
> silent on the subject and will so continue after his. Accept my kind
> regards.

William Law merely claimed that the allegations of a wife-swap
proposition between the Laws and Smiths was patently false, but he did
notably carve out the possibility that Emma may have been looking
elsewhere than Jo to satisfy her needs in exchange for no longer
hounding Jo about all of his wives. So where does that leave us? We have
a contemporary antagonistic source making the accusation that Emma and
Jo brokered some kind of deal with William and Jane Law, then we have a
late antagonistic reminiscence, more than 40 years after the fact, by
the accused completely denying anything of the sort with himself, but
leaving open the possibility that somebody else may have been the
subject of such a deal. Then he wrapped with saying he’s tried to forget
any association he had with Mormonism as the greatest mistake of his
life. Law’s letter from 40 years later taken into the context of the
text of 132 commanding Emma to not partake of that which god commanded
Jo to offer to Emma may exonerate his own name, but it far from
alleviates any possibility of some kind of swap.

With that said, we also have Emma’s response to Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff
Smith reading to her the text of D\&C 132. The interaction was recorded
in William Clayton’s journal contemporary with the event, but he gave a
detailed affidavit in the 1870s that provides much more detail and
corroborates his brief journal entry of the day. The relevant piece of
his affidavit is as follows:

> On the morning of the 12 of July, 1843, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, came
> into the office, in the upper story of the red brick store, on the
> bank of the Mississippi river. They were talking on the subject of
> plural marriage. Hyrum said to Joseph, “if you will write the
> revelation on Celestial marriage, I will take, and read it to Emma,
> and I believe I can convince her of its truth, and you will hereafter
> have its truth, and you will hereafter have peace.” Joseph smiled and
> remarked, “you do not know Emma as well as I do.” Hyrum repeated his
> opinion and further remarked, “the doctrine is so plain I can convince
> any reasonable man or woman of its truth, purity and heavenly origin,”
> or words to their effect. Joseph then said, “well, I will write the
> revelation, and we will see.” He then requested me to get paper and
> prepare to write. Hyrum very urgently requested Joseph to write the
> revelation by means of the Urim and Thummim, but Joseph, in reply,
> said he did not need to, for he knew the revelation perfectly from
> beginning to end…
> 
> Hyrum then took the revelation, to read to Emma. Joseph remained with
> me in the office until Hyrum returned. When he came back, Joseph asked
> him how he succeeded. Hyrum replied that he had never received a more
> severe talking to in his life, that Emma was very bitter and full of
> resentment and anger.
> 
> Joseph quietly remarked, “I told you, you did not know Emma as well as
> I did.” Joseph then put the Revelation in his pocket and they both
> left the office.

And that copy of 132, the one Jo put in his pocket, was the copy he gave
to Emma and consented to have it burned at her wish. But that’s okay,
because Jo could recreate it any time necessary and we know it was
recreated and given to Joseph Kingsbury and Newell Whitney, from which
D\&C 132 was printed. As a peripheral question I’ll ask, what does it
say about Jo that he had his older brother try to convince his wife that
polygamy was okay? Why couldn’t he do it himself?

The timing here is a bit complicated. When the revelation was actually
dictated Emma was well aware of her husband spending a lot of time with
other women in Nauvoo. Seeing the actual revelation in print doesn’t
seem to explain her angered reaction unless Jo’s polygamy was a
slow-rolling boil for her and presenting her with the actual text set
her over the edge. Is there something more to the story?

What explains her reaction to me is the point in the revelation calling
her to cleave to none other than Joseph and condemning her if she didn’t
consent to the wives Jo proposed to with the Law of Sarah bit. According
to the text itself, god commanded Jo to broker some kind of deal with
Emma, but it was revoked by the text of 132 like the commandment of
Abraham to kill his son, Isaac. Their deal was just a test for Emma’s
faithfulness in the words of the lord. If you’re in an open relationship
but only one member of that relationship is allowed to have friends with
benefits, it’s understandable that other member would be a little mad
that they couldn’t go get some too.

Regardless of what it was that infuriated her specifically, she
eventually agreed to Jo taking some young women as wives, assenting to
the Law of Sarah contained in the last 8 verses of the revelation. These
wives were the Partridge sisters and the Lawrence sisters, and we’re
about to dive into the details of these relationships with the help of
some amazing historians.

A detail worth prefacing this information is that Jo had already taken
the Partridge sisters, Emily and Eliza, to wife when Emma gave her
consent in line with the Law of Sarah, but those first marriages were
done unbeknownst to Emma. As a result of Emma giving her consent after
Jo had already taken Emily and Eliza to wife, they performed a second
ceremony under Emma’s supervision, and the tension during that ceremony
is palpable, soon to be discussed.

Newell and Avery’s excellent biography of Emma, Mormon Enigma,
reconstructs the passage of events expertly, so I’m going to read a
fairly large extract from their book, with only small edits for
continuity. I’m picking up a bit earlier in the year of 1843 for some
context. It begins right after discussing the Eliza Snow staircase
incident from about February 1843, which we discussed on episode 137 –
Emma’s Stairway to Hell, then goes on to tell the stories of Eliza and
Emily Partridge, largely taken from their own hand. Here we go:

> After Eliza Snow’s abrupt departure from Emma’s house in February
> 1843, Joseph apparently resolved to pursue the establishment of plural
> marriage in spite of Emma’s strong feelings. He approached Bishop
> Edward Partridge’s daughters, who had lived for two years in his home.
> Emily was nineteen on February 28, 1843; Eliza would be twenty-three
> on April 20. “The first intimation I had from Brother Joseph that
> there was a pure and holy order of plural marriage,” Emily wrote, “was
> in the spring of 1842, but I was not married until 1843.” Emily
> recorded the events of that year in her reminiscences. “Joseph said to
> me one day, ‘Emily, if you will not betray me, I will tell you
> something for your benefit.’ Of course I would keep his secret, but no
> opportunity offered for some time to say anything to me… he asked me
> if I would burn it if he would write me a letter.” Emily promised to
> do as he wished. “I began to think that was not the proper thing for
> me to do and I was about as miserable as I ever would wish to be for a
> short time. I went to my room and knelt down and asked my father in
> heaven to direct me in the matter… I could not speak to any one on

> him.”
> 
> “Do you wish the matter ended?” he asked.
> 
> “I do,” she replied. But as time passed Emily wished that she had
> listened and felt “as miserable” as she was before.
> 
> Soon after Emily refused Joseph’s letter she and her sister Eliza
> received an invitation from Mrs. Elizabeth Durfee \<Mother in Israel
> comment\> to spend the afternoon at her home. Emily described this
> visit: “She introduced the subject of spiritual wives as they called

> soon after,” Emily noted. Word that Emily would not betray Joseph was
> probably carried back to him by Mrs. Durfee. “I learned afterward,”
> Emily wrote, “that Mrs. \[Durfee\] was a friend to plurality and knew
> all about it.”

Let’s just pause there for a moment. Mrs. Durfee was one of the Mothers
of Israel who was friendly to the idea of polygamy and would actually
help Jo acquire more wives. She, among a few other older plural wives,
would meet privately with younger women and teach them the idea of
polygamy, or at least put a bug in their ear about it, then gauge how
receptive they would be to the idea and report their findings to Jo.
Then he would act based upon that information. In the case of Nancy
Rigdon, he denied everything and minimized his own actions. In the case
of the Partridge sisters, he knew they could be trusted and set up a
meeting in a safe place, which Mrs. Durfee arranged on behalf of Jo, in
the home of Heber the Creeper and Vilate Kimball. Emily’s recounting of
events shows the personal turmoil caused by this controversial
proposition that ran counter to everything she knew of church doctrine
and her own personal morality.

> Emily agreed to meet Joseph at Heber Kimball’s house in the evening.
> Some Kimball family members were present when she arrived. Heber
> explained to her, “Vilate is not at home, and you had better call

> The date was March 4, 1843.
> 
> Four days later Eliza Partridge married Joseph. She kept a journal but
> burned it later because it was “too full.”

This is all taken from Emily Partridge because Eliza Partridge burned
her journal because it was “too full.” I don’t think anytime in the
history of the English language has anybody said so much by saying so
little than what was said in those two little words. These marriages
were apparently concealed from Emma, as they occurred 4 months before
the revelation was dictated and the possible deal was brokered between
Emma and Jo. The consternation captured by Newell and Avery here reveals
a tendency that was a common thread among most of the women who were
married into polygamy in Nauvoo. They became targets of Mormon elites
and once that happened their paths were laid. They had no real choice in
the matter. They were forced to shoulder rumors and drama through none
of their own actions. They were given the prophet’s secretive burden to
bear and they didn’t know who they could or couldn’t trust. When
Elizabeth Durfee approached Emily to gauge where Emily’s mind was on the
idea of polygamy, Emily had no idea that Durfee was a Mother of Israel
and trying, at that very moment, to coerce her into polygamy. The
secrecy must have been a heavy cloud over every initiate’s head. Newell
and Avery continue to reconstruct the situation so well, I’ll let them
continue to tell the story.

But apparently Emma choosing the Partridge sisters for Jo wasn’t enough,
because she also chose the Lawrence sisters. We’ll get back to Newell
and Avery momentarily but first an extract about Sarah and Maria
Lawrence from Compton’s excellent historiography, In Sacred Loneliness
beginning on 474.

So, what do we make of this so far? Sarah and Maria Lawrence were at
this time in 1843 17 and 19 years old. Their father had died three years
previous and they took board with the Smiths in Nauvoo probably
beginning in mid to late 1841. Edward and Margaret were wealthy and his
will divided up his estate among his wife and children, leaving probably
about $18,000 in the names of Sarah and Maria. Custody, in cases like
this, usually went to men because women could only have custody of their
children if they were married. Their mother, Margaret, married a
long-time Mormon elite, Josiah Butterfield, who’d helped Jo push through
his writ of Habeas Corpus in Springfield that we talked about on
episodes 137 and 138 with the help of Andrew Torrez. Since Jo and Emma
were granted legal guardianship, the estate was put into their control
until Sarah and Maria came of age to use the money. However, when Josiah
Butterfield sought a meeting with Jo to get the estate transferred to
his and Margaret’s names, Jo literally kicked him out of his house and
across the street.

After this unpleasant interaction, Jo’s Nauvoo journal has a few more
entries until his death concerning the Lawrence estate, but very little
is actually known of the fate of that money, in spite of numerous
possibilities. One reasonable way to interpret the record is that the
Lawrence money was put into Jo and Emma’s hands as they were the legal
guardians. Jo probably thought he could use the money for now to make
some investments, and when the time came to pay it out he’d have the
money he made from those other investments to fulfill his duties as
guardian and pay up. As we know, Jo was always behind the eight ball
when it came to money. He was on the hook for hundreds of thousands of
dollars in debt at this point and $18 grand could have REALLY come in
handy to relieve some of the pressure. Basically, what I’m saying is Jo
and Emma probably stole that money from Sarah and Maria Lawrence, and
then Emma gave her consent for Jo to take them both to wife. This
shouldn’t be a surprising interpretation of the documentation because Jo
screwed everybody with whom he came in contact.

No available documentation illuminates the actual fate of that money,
but my explanation falls perfectly within the typical practices of Jo
throughout most of his life. Picking up another paragraph from Compton’s
book.

I suppose an interesting question with no real answer would be, why
would Emma choose these two sets of sisters for Jo to take as polygamous
wives? We can’t actually know, just speculate, but the information
before us leads to some reasonable possibilities. With the Partridge
sisters, Emma had become like a second mother to them. Jo and Emma had
been close friends with their parents for the decade before Edward
Party-boy Partridge had died in 1840, when the Partridge girls weren’t
even teenagers yet. They’d taken Emily and Eliza under their wings and
had been caring for them ever since their father’s death. The Smiths had
watched Emily and Eliza grow up, they knew the two of them to be good,
trustworthy daughters in Zion who could probably keep the secret.
Besides, they were already living in the Smith household and spending a
lot of time with Emma and Jo, so if he was married to them people would
think nothing more of seeing Jo with them, things were as they should
be.

The same could nearly be said about the Lawrence sisters, although the
Lawrence family had only converted in 1837 so they didn’t have the
history with the Smith family that the Partridge sisters had.
Regardless, they had a ton of money in their name and when Jo and Emma
were named guardians of the Lawrence sisters, that money came into their
control. If Jo and Emma were bound to the Lawrence sisters through
marriage, they may never leave the custody of the Smiths and possession
of that estate, and the actual fate of those thousands of dollars, may
never come into question. Nobody in Nauvoo was more in-tune with Jo’s
complex web of finances than Emma and marrying the Lawrence sisters may
have alleviated some financial pressures that were continually closing
in on the Smiths.

The sectarian or theological justifications may hold weight for some of
these polygamous marriages for some people. But when you add in the
details that Jo and Emma may have picked the Partridge sisters for their
convenience and ability to keep a secret, and the Lawrence sisters for
the Smiths own financial gain, those justifications from a higher power
go right out the window. There is no excuse for this. What Jo and Emma
did here was simply immoral, and all of it was a result of Jo’s terrible
financial situation and his complete inability to be satisfied in a
monogamous marriage, in spite of multiple hypocritical statements to the
contrary.

Regardless of the reasoning behind it, Emma apparently gave her consent
to these marriages, coming into accordance with the Law of Sarah. But
all was not well. The tensions were felt immediately after the
ceremonies were performed and only escalated from that time forward.

Back to Newell and Avery’s biography of Emma Smith, Mormon Enigma:

And in case somebody wants to make the case that these marriages somehow
didn’t include all aspects of typical marriages, I quote again from
Mormon Enigma.

Emma’s thoughts on polygamy after Jo’s death leave absolutely no
uncertainty that she hated the very idea of it. Polygamy had caused her
so much trouble throughout her life, it fueled the persecution the
Mormons experienced and ultimately led to the deaths of her husband and
one of her closest friends, Hyrum. In 1843, she had no idea what the
future held. Jo had a long history of stepping out on her and she
probably knew that could never be stopped, but if she could approve of
the wives he took and they were mainly women who were already living
with the Smiths, she could exercise at least the smallest modicum of
control over a situation she was ultimately powerless in stopping. Her
reluctant acceptance of polygamy would sometimes go so far as to guard
the door of a room that Jo and one of his teenage wives were hold up in,
according to Emily Partridge, to deter any interested observers. Other
times, she was staunchly against polygamy and her husband having teenage
wives. But she was forced to operate under the doctrine of appeasement
to keep from conflict, as she was an inherently nonconfrontational
person; a general people-pleaser.

What else could she do? The reputation of her husband and her own self
lay in the balance if the rumors of polygamy became anything more than
just rumors. She couldn’t stop Jo, but she could cover for him to help
from it being exposed. She didn’t know what would happen, Jo didn’t know
what would happen, nobody had any idea what the future held should Jo go
public with polygamy. The entirety of Emma’s interactions with Nauvoo
polygamy strike me as somebody who’s biding their time when they don’t
have any options or solutions.

I mean, she did have options and solutions, but the consequences of
those were probably just too great to overcome. The Nauvoo Emma strikes
me as somebody who was overcome with feelings of both grief and relief
when Jo was finally killed. That’s probably an unpopular opinion, but
just consider her plight and the possible consequences if she tried to
change the hand she was dealt. Jo had EVERYTHING in his control. He had
women coercing other women to become his wives. People were killed for
not paying their tithing. He had a massive network of spies and nothing
happened in Nauvoo without his knowledge. The legal system had
repeatedly proven itself completely impotent in trying to curtail his
growing power and he had politicians by the dozen in his pockets or
filling the pews of his church. He was probably the wealthiest man in
Illinois, even if every one of his assets had liens, the counterfeit
business provided plenty of liquid money for him to live his preferred
hard and fast life. He had an army in his control and an underground
militia that lived in the shadows. Every street had a young man
whittling with a bowie knife watching everything that happened in the
city and funneling that information right back to their
commander-in-chief. Anybody who opposed Jo wound up with either their
character or their life assassinated. Even with all of these
descriptions, words fail me in aptly describing how powerful and
terrifying Jo truly was.

What could Emma do? Could she just divorce him? He’d destroy her
character and she’d never recover. What would the kids think? Could she
go public with the accusation of polygamy, and sue Jo for divorce on
grounds of adultery? Where would the average everyday Mormon come down
on this massively public battle? Could she poison him and her problems
would be solved? Possibly, but from who would she procure the poison?
How could she affect such a plan without Jo noticing? Could she organize
a coup and have him assassinated? There would be absolutely no way to
make that happen without Jo finding out and exacting some form of
punishment or revenge. Could she plead to the Governor to have her
husband arrested? She’d repeatedly plead to both Governor Carlin and
Governor Ford to have her husband released from prison on multiple
occasions, why would they believe her? What reasonable expectation did
she have of them being successful in any kind of government action to
bring Jo in and ACTUALLY get him sent to prison or the gallows?

You see, we have to look back and wonder, how could Emma possibly sign
off on Jo taking teenage wives living under her own roof? I would ask,
how could she NOT sign off? How could she do anything other than just
pacify and appease without her life being threatened? She couldn’t break
the system, it was too robust, so she played the game by Jo’s rules
until it was over… and then she could make her own rules.
