Ep 150 – Helen Mar Kimball

On this episode, we seek to humanize a controversial and fascinating
figure of Nauvoo Mormonism. Helen Mar Kimball has been leveraged as an
attack against Joseph Smith for decades. The person at the center of
those attacks is a wonderful and dynamic woman who was torn with
following the prophet and her parents, or living the life of a teenager
with her friends. Let’s inject the human element into the historical
enigma, Helen Mar Kimball.

I thought through this life my time will be my own

The step I now am taking’s for eternity alone,

No need to be the wiser, through time I shall be free,

And as the past hath been the future still will be.

To my guileless heart all free from worldly care

And full of blissful hopes and youthful visions rare

The world seamed bright the thret’ning clouds were kept

From sight and all looked fair but pitying angels wept.

They saw my youthful friends grow shy and cold.

And poisonous darts from sland’rous sacrafise,

Thou dids’t not weigh the cost nor know the bitter price;

Thy happy dreams all o’er thou’st doom’d alas to be

Bar’d out from social scenes by this thy destiny,

And o’er thy sad’nd mem’ries of sweet departed joys

Thy sicken’d heart will brood and imagine future woes,

And like a fetter’d bird with wild and longing heart,

Thou’lt dayly pine for freedom and murmur at thy lot;

But could’st thou see the future & view that glorious crown,

Awaiting you in Heaven you would not weep nor mourn.

Pure and exalted was thy father’s aim, he saw

A glory in obeying this high celestial law,

For to thousands who’ve died without the light

I will bring eternal joy & make thy crown more bright.

I’d been taught to reveire the Prophet of God

And receive every word as the word of the Lord,

But had this not come through my dear father’s mouth,

I should ne’r have received it as God’s sacred truth.

\-Helen Mar Kimball

Today’s show will be focused on one person, Helen Mar Kimball. Helen’s
story has been told a number of times in a number of places and every
time that story is taken from the same sources. I’m going to be relying
on those same sources to tell her story here because those sources are
from her own hand. Helen Mar Kimball Smith Whitney is an interesting
figure in Mormon history. She was the youngest of all Joseph Smith’s
wives, but so often she’s only boiled down to just that, Jo’s
14-year-old wife. But she’s so much more than a common jab at the
supposed piety of the prophet. She was a faithful member of the church
her whole life. She was an advocate for polygamy while wrestling with
her own internal conflicts concerning celestial marriage. Her entire
family were some of the highest-regarded members of the Mormon elite.
She had 11 children in her 68 years of vital life. She was a prolific
writer and occasional poet. She authored two pamphlets defending the
practice of the New and Everlasting Covenant of Mormon polygynous
marriage. She loved music and dancing and respected her parents even
through disagreements with them. She was allowed by church leaders to
marry for love, but only for time, not eternity. Her daily life and
eternal destiny were coopted and spoken for long before she had any say
in what her future held. She also played the hand she was dealt, and did
so masterfully.

But time and time again, Helen Mar Kimball is reduced to an attack point
against Joseph Smith. Jo married a 14-year-old, he was a pedophile\!
First off, there’s no evidence Jo was a pedophile so please stop saying
that. The technical term is ephebophile, a person who’s attracted to
teenagers. Second, what does it say about Helen Mar Kimball, a human
being with her own desires, story, flaws, and beliefs, when we reduce
her to an attack point against her victimizer? I’ve done it, I’m sure
many of you have done it. So, let’s correct our approach. Let’s humanize
this attack point and understand her true story. Let’s understand who
Helen Mar Kimball was as a person, instead of reducing her to a pithy
jab.

I’m going to send you to chapter 22 of Compton’s In Sacred Loneliness to
understand Helen’s story. Also, Lindsay’s Year of Polygamy podcast
episode on Helen is particularly outstanding. All of us are working from
the same sources because they’re firsthand and incredibly revealing.
Helen is one of the best-documented of Jo’s polygamous wives and she
left a lot of autobiographical information of her early life in
Mormonism, including a detailed diary with nearly daily entries from
1884-96, which was transcribed and edited into an over 900-page volume
of A Widow’s Tale in 2003. She spent nearly her entire life in the
highest strata, the uppermost layer of the Mormon hierarchy crust, a
status she enjoyed solely because of the men she was joined to through
family and marriage. With that said, let’s try to understand Helen as
best we can, from her own hand.

Helen was born into the Kimball family as the only surviving daughter in
August of 1828. The Kimballs lived in a little town called Monroe, New
York, just a day’s journey from the organization place of the church in
Fayette, New York. Her parents, Vilate and Heber had married in 1822 and
built a small farm in the town. The Kimball family and the Brigham Young
family were very close. Helen sometimes called Bloody Brigham Young’s
sister, Fanny Young, “Aunt Fanny”. In early 1832 the Kimball and Young
family came across a Book of Mormon and were converted to the faith. A
year later both families made their way to Kirtland, Ohio, where the
church had recently taken up headquarters. Helen was 3-years-old when
her parents were baptized into the church.

Being an only daughter of a large family, it’s clear that Heber favored
Helen from her earliest days. The family was also reasonably well-off
and Helen rarely wanted for food.

> “I remember the cunning little dishes and toys \[father\] would make
> for me, which I generously divided with my mates who were less
> fortunate.”

Helen also revered her parents as wise and pious, remarking on how her
parents seemed to be saints. She didn’t share the same penchant for
religious aspirations, instead thinking in her young age that a
deathbed-type conversion would suffice for salvation.

> “I used to think it impossible for me to ever become a Saint. I looked
> upon my parents as such, but thought that nothing short of perfection
> could take us to heaven, which I could never attain to, as I was so
> fond of fun and amusement that I could not possibly give them up,
> though I often had very serious reflections upon the subject, and used
> to think if I could only know just a little time before I was to die,
> I might be able to sober down and prepare myself.”

Compton writes:

> Like Zina Huntington, Helen remembered Kirtland as an idyllic time,
> and left descriptions of the beauty of the surrounding groves. At
> Sunday schools, she wrote, “I used to love to go and recite verses and
> whole chapters from the New Testament, and we received rewards in
> primers, etc…. At ten o’clock we would form in line and march with our
> teachers up to the temple.”

When Eliza Snow was baptized into the church in late 1835, Snow began
teaching school in Kirtland for the brief time before the Mormon removal
to Missouri. Young Helen, just hitting elementary school age, attended
Snow’s schoolhouse, which was a wing of the Kirtland Joseph and Emma
Smith home. In a rare example of the Book of Mormon being used for
instruction, Helen learned to read using the Book of Mormon, among other
common schoolbooks of the day, as a textbook of instruction.

When young Helen was only 5 years old, her father, Heber the Creeper
Kimball, left with Jo, Bloody Brigham Young, and nearly 200 other men on
their mission to redeem Zion, known as Zion’s camp, the first military
campaign in Mormonism. Zion’s camp fizzled out, but as a consolation for
a mission incomplete, many of the Mormon hierarchy were called from
participants in Zion’s camp. Heber was one of these men called to the
Quorum of Apostles. From that time forward the Kimball family would
enjoy elevated status anywhere Mormonism had a presence.

Heber was called on another brief mission in 1836 to the eastern states.
Vilate travelled to meet Heber on his return. Helen remembered their
return when she was 7 years old.

> “I… remember the morning when \[mother’s\] sweet face peeped into the
> door, I was just kindling the fire and how quickly I dropped the wood

Helen was baptized in the winter of that year.

> I was baptized by Uncle Brigham Young in a branch of the Chagrin
> river, my father cutting the ice for that purpose. He & Brigham Young
> then belonged to the Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

Later that year Heber the Creeper left for a mission to England, which
didn’t turn up any respectable number of converts, but laid the
foundation for the Quorum of Apostles to have a successful mission there
from 1839-41. The Kimball family was again left alone in Kirtland
without their father as Heber’s prominence in the church continued to
grow. He returned in May 1838.

During this mission, the church had undergone many problems and changes.
The Kirtland Safety Society had been formed and failed. Joseph and
Hingepin Sidney Rigdon had absconded to Missouri to escape incarceration
and the lawsuits that were piling up against them in Ohio. Brigham Young
and most of the remaining apostles had made their way to Missouri as
well. Rebel factions opposed to Jo’s leadership had formed. The city of
Kirtland was in turmoil. Helen, approaching 10 years old and completely
ignorant or insulated from what was going on around her, departed
Kirtland with her parents in July of 1838, writing

> When we started for Missouri I was delighted, as children commonly
> are, at the prospect of a change… although some of my little mates
> tried to frighten me with awful tales about being eaten alive by the
> Missourians, who were cannibals with horns.

When the Kimball family arrived in Far West, Missouri a month later,
they took brief lodging in the home of the Pattens. Here Helen made
friends with David and Phoebe Patten, along with their children. They
eventually moved to another small log home in downtown Far West. David
Patten was one of the few casualties of the Battle of Crooked River
during the 1838 Missouri-Mormon war. Helen remembers coming to the
Pattens’ home when David had just been slain, providing a brief sketch
of the strength and resolve of Phoebe.

> I can never forget her fearless and determined look… Around her waist
> was a belt to which was attached a large bowie knife \[and she
> intended to fight\] if any of the demons came there.

When Helen and the Kimball family arrived in Missouri, the Mormons
weren’t long for that state. It was less than 6 months that the
Kimballs were there before the Extermination order was signed by
Governor Lilburn Boggs and the prophet, along with his closest acolytes,
were imprisoned.

During the winter of 1838-9, the Quorum of Apostles took the lead in
coordinating the Mormon exodus from Missouri to Illinois. Bloody Brigham
Young, with his right-hand man, Heber the Creeper Kimball, took the
mantle of acting presidents while Jo and his other fellow leadership
languished in Missouri jails. While Heber and Brigham directed the
affairs of the church and its members, Vilate and Fanny took care of the
Kimball and Young families. Helen remembers their journey from Missouri
to Illinois, which began in mid-February, 1839. The journey was rough,
the cold climate in the Missouri winter made trudging through the snow a
challenge, and every household harbored potential anti-Mormons,
requiring them to take refuge in houses under false pretenses.

> The day we started the weather was terrible, and my mother and Sister
> Young, with their children, stopped at a \[non-Mormon\] house and
> asked the privilege of warming themselves. \[They were admitted.\]
> There were no men, only women there, but they began talking about the
> horrible “Mormons” and eyed us very closely. Sister Young and my
> mother appeared to believe all they said, and looked horrified, and we
> children imitated them.

Another detail Helen provides was her older brother, William, nearly
freezing to death. He was riding on a horse and fell off into the snow
unconscious. Dr. Levi Richards saw this and jumped from his horse to
reanimate the teenage boy. Richards rubbed young William all over to
keep the blood flowing then when William regained consciousness Richards
smacked him around a bit making William “angry enough to fight, started
the blood to circulating and saved his life.”

When the journey was over, the hardships truly began for Helen and the
Kimball family. They were forced to make their way to building a small
log home in Nauvoo while Helen’s mother, Vilate, was once again pregnant
with a young brother to Helen, who they named David Patten Kimball in
honor of the fallen warrior from the Battle at Crooked River. They
suffered through untold trials as they built a new life in Nauvoo. Helen
later remembered the picturesque Nauvoo with fondness in one of her
biographical sketches, reminiscing about the

> Green woods and hills and delightful views… and most of all… the view
> of the broad Mississippi, where we could see and hear the steamers as
> they plied up and down its quiet bosom… those rich prairies covered,
> as far as the eye could reach, with tall waving grass, and decked with
> wild flowers of various hues.

Memory has a way of idealizing the past during troublesome times. She
remembered Nauvoo with kind memories, but also recounts how poor the
Mormons were and how rough life really was.

> In the month of July, \[1839\] father \[Heber C. Kimball\] moved us up
> to Commerce; he pulled down an old log stable belonging to a Brother
> Bozier, about one mile from the river, and laid up the logs at the end

> mostly prostrated by sickness. Brother Pratt soon sold out his
> improvements and went with his family on a mission to England.

Helen also details how sick the family was constantly with malaria in
that first and second summer of Nauvoo life. As was a common mindset in
her time, Helen believed severe sickness to be caused by evil spirits
inhabiting the hosts of the sickness. Church leaders believed similarly,
explaining why they frequently coupled folk herb remedies with exorcisms
to heal the afflicted. Helen details when the malaria ravaged her
family. The Kimballs were even favored with visits from the prophet to
help heal them from time to time.

Heber the Creeper Kimball went with the Apostles on their mission to
Europe from 1839-41. Helen remembers when they departed Nauvoo, leaving
the Kimball family behind to make their own way in the ailing and
destitute little town that would soon become Nauvoo.

> the gospel of salvation, sustained those who were left.

Helen’s memory is vivid and detailed in what transpired in Nauvoo. Her
pen has proven invaluable in understanding some of the context of Nauvoo
Mormonism and what the practice of sealing and celestial marriage looked
like under Joseph Smith’s leadership once Helen was targeted and marked
by the prophet.

Helen has revealed a lot of her early life and early teenagehood to the
record of history. We should understand the perspective from which she
wrote these memories. She was a Mormon elite living in Utah in the early
1880s when most of this information was initially written. She was
daughter of the elite Heber the Creeper Kimball, sealed for time and
eternity to Joseph Smith, then resealed for time to her similarly aged,
Horace Whitney, son of Mormon elites Newell and Elizabeth Whitney, the
first family to take the Smiths in to their home in the early Kirtland
years. Helen was poised as truly one of the most elite women of Mormon
nepotism when she wrote most of her memories of Nauvoo Mormonism because
she didn’t keep a contemporary journal at the time. Also consider what
was going on in Utah when she wrote this information in the early 1880s.
The state was coming under heavy scrutiny by the federal government for
their practice of polygamy. The government was seizing any property over
$50,000. Many Mormon elites including Lorenzo Snow and John Taylor were
constantly in hiding, moving from safehouse to safehouse to escape the
law. Utah was trying to become a state, but was barred from gaining
statehood until they outlawed polygamy. Helen wrote her first pamphlet
defense of polygamy in 1882 as a response to Joseph Smith III when he
was prophet claiming polygamy was never practiced by his father in
Nauvoo. The second of her pamphlets was written just two years later in
1884 titled “Why we Practice Plural Marriage,” which was printed in the
Utah Juvenile Instructor. She died in November of 1896, living just
barely long enough to see Utah become a state after the first manifesto
was created and published by Wilford Woodruff in 1890 putting a hold on
polygamy until the second coming.

Needless to say, her memory of Nauvoo polygamy and Jo’s proposal to her
certainly had some complex motivations and slants to it. With that said,
the words and phrases she uses to describe the doctrine and practice, at
least in her reminiscences, don’t read like a polygamy apologist, but
sincere recitations of the passage of events. She is very clear and
unabashed in her retelling of her teenage years in Nauvoo. She provides
a colorful perspective of everything the marriage entailed, telling of
her own frustrations and inner-conflict stemming from the introduction
of celestial marriage by her own father. Compton amply summarizes her
writings of her own memory and the practice by saying:

> \[Helen Mar Kimball\] is perhaps the classic example of a woman whose
> conversion to polygamy was difficult but complete, coming only after a
> period of severe cognitive dissonance.

Helen’s interactions with Jo had likely been infrequent prior to 1843.
She’d seen Jo and her father meet from time to time when Jo would come
over to the Kimball house to conduct business or speak with her parents
for any reason. She’d seen Jo preach repeatedly and must have revered
him as the holy and pious prophet the majority of Mormons thought him to
be. A brief interaction occurred when Jo came over to the Kimball home
sometime in 1842. He was talking to Heber and Vilate about some matter
or another when he picked up a little doll that Heber had sent to Helen
from Europe during his mission there a year and a half prior. Something
or another happened and the head fell off the doll while it was in Jo’s
hands. Helen remembers the scenario in her 1881 reminiscence and reports
his reaction was typical Jo and her reaction is simply priceless.

> He merely remarked: ‘As that has fallen, so shall the heathen gods
> fall.’ I stood there a silent observer, unable to understand or
> appreciate the prophetic words, but thought them a rather weak apology
> for breaking my doll’s head off.

That was probably sometime in 1842. At this time, Jo’s ephebophilic
attractions toward Helen had likely engaged and she was marked. Sometime
in 1841-3 she entered the realm of having absolutely no choice but to
acquiesce to Jo’s will. Once she was marked, Jo put a plan into play.
His true intentions aren’t made clear given the sequence of events, but
it all ended with Helen being sealed to him so it seems he eventually
got what he wanted.

I’ll lay out the plan and then we’ll go through the documentation used
to form the historical model I describe. Jo decided to test Heber and
Vilate Kimball. He wanted to know how loyal they were and gave them an
Abrahamic test. He told Heber that the Lord had given Vilate to Jo. They
pondered it for 3 grueling days, and eventually agreed. When they
approached Jo in agreement to his demand, he told them it was a test and
that they were now to be sealed together. After their sealing, Jo tested
Heber again by teaching him about celestial marriage, telling Heber it
was necessary to enter into polygamy himself. Heber thought he would
select the wives he would take, but was sorely mistaken because Jo had
already designated who his second wife would be. A short time after
Heber was sealed to his second wife, Jo gave the Kimballs another test.
He now wanted their 14-year-old daughter. They agreed. Heber taught
Helen about the doctrine of celestial marriage and she went counter to
every cultural and visceral inhibition and finally agreed to be sealed
to the prophet. Then she came under Jo’s control and was barred from
participating in the activities of her peers because Jo feared that a
boy her age would snap her up. She was very bitter about this fact.
Then, a year after she was sealed to Joseph for time and eternity, she
became the youngest of Jo’s widows when he was assassinated in Carthage.
During this time she developed an attraction to Horace Whitney, son of
Newell and Elizabeth Whitney. After Jo’s death she was married to Horace
for time, as her eternity had already been spoken for by the prophet.

That’s the sequence of events as the best polygamy historians have
reconstructed. A bit dehumanizing, isn’t it? Almost as dehumanizing as
attacking Mormon history by saying Joseph Smith married a 14-year-old
girl and then forgetting her name. What did she think of all this? What
was life like in the Kimball family as they were slowly initiated into
the practice? It wasn’t easy. We’re going to read Helen’s own words
about her conversion to polygamy in a minute, but first a passage from
Compton’s In Sacred Loneliness to shed some light on Jo’s Abrahamic test
of the Kimball family. Beginning on page 495. Much of this comes from
Helen’s son, Orson Whitney, who wrote the biography of Heber C. Kimball
published in 1888. You’ll find a link to it on Archive.org in the show
notes along with an amazon link for Compton’s book. This is kind of a
long read but it’s expertly constructed and very revealing.

> The first chapter in the story of Smith, the Kimballs, and polygamy is
> that of Vilate’s offering, which Orson Whitney, Helen’s own son,

Compton’s reconstruction of events reveals certain patterns and
tendencies Joseph Smith employed to bring people into the practice of
polygamy. First, a test of fealty. Once the person passed, then Jo would
begin a campaign probing into a deeper degree of coercion into something
that person’s morals were fundamentally opposed to. Heber and Vilate
Kimball had proved themselves church-broke and willing to sell out their
system of Victorian morals to follow the word of the prophet. Church
leaders today can say there’s no right way to do the wrong thing, but
Joseph Smith is the paramount example of that which is wrong under once
circumstance may be right under another. When he commanded something to
be done, it was done, often with the looming threat of damnation should
his followers run counter to his will. When it comes to the Kimball
family, sure they enjoyed the utmost elite status in Mormonism
throughout most of their membership, but that clearly came at a price.

Jo threatened damnation, the Kimballs fell into line, then it was time
to really test how far Vilate and Heber were willing to go.

According to Compton, he discusses Vilate’s conversion to the principle
of celestial marriage. He reports family folklore as follows:

> Heber asked God to reveal the principle to Vilate, and soon after she
> was allowed a vision of immortal joy in celestial, plural marriage,
> and saw Sarah Noon as Heber’s wife. She came to her husband and said,
> “Heber, what you kept from me the Lord has shown me.”

Thus, according to family tradition, Vilate and Heber had complete
conversions to Mormon polygamy, in spite of their Victorian
predilections. What about Helen though?

We’re lucky Helen Mar Kimball left behind so much detail of this episode
in her life, even if it was 40 years after it happened and she’d been
living polygamy her entire life. So, I’ll let her tell the story for
herself so we can further humanize this incredible and controversial
woman of Mormon history.

This passage comes from a letter Helen wrote in 1881 to her children.
The letter also included the poem I read at the beginning of this
episode. The entire letter is fascinating. A little preface to it. This
is written in the context of Helen alone learning of the doctrine of
celestial marriage. It takes place after Heber and Vilate had gone
through their Abrahamic trials and were practicing celestial marriage.
Sarah Peake Noon may have been pregnant with Heber’s first polygynous
child at this time.

This was the carrot stick of Mormon theology. The greatest reward was to
be sealed to the prophet in the eternities, the alternate resulted in
eternal damnation. By virtue of giving their daughter to be sealed to Jo
for time and eternity, Heber and Vilate, along with all their subsequent
wives and sister-wives, were sealed to the prophet’s eternal lineage and
their place was ensured in the celestial kingdom where they would create
worlds without number.

Helen was given a 24-hour period to make her decision. What decision did
she have though? Her parents had decided her fate, Jo had targeted her,
Helen’s path was laid. Now it was merely left to whether or not she
would walk it, or turn her back on it and suffer the label of apostate
in this life and damnation for eternity.

Sometime in May of 1843, Helen was sealed to Joseph Smith a few months
shy of her 15<sup>th</sup> birthday. Now she was spoken for, and Jo
required Helen to no longer be in any social situation where she may be
courted by any boys her age, which Helen became extremely bitter about,
especially as she had already taken a bit of a liking to Horace Whitney,
son of Newell and Elizabeth Whitney.

Those blacklegs and ones of questionable character could have been
anybody, but most reasonably could be referring to other teenagers she
may divulge her secret to, not understanding the gravity of what had
transpired.

Soon after the marriage took place, Heber went on another mission to the
eastern states. He sent a letter to Helen, she must have been on his
mind and was likely exhibiting symptoms of anxiety or depression.

> My Dear Helen.--… You have been on my mind much since I left home…
> learn to be meek and gentle… and always speak kindly to your dear
> mother and listen to her counsel… My child, remember the care that
> your dear father and mother have for your welfare in this life, that

> sacred… Let us seek to be true to our integrity wherever we shall make
> vows or covenants with each other… Now let us be careful that we do
> not make a breach.

Heber had but one ewe lamb, and this is what the offering looked like.
Compton summarizes on page 500 of In Sacred Loneliness very well.

Understandable. She was plucked from the flock of her peers at a young
impressionable age, and given the secrets of a criminal empire to keep
to herself. If I can borrow from the Handmaid’s tale, a rat in a maze is
free to go anywhere, as long as it stays in the maze. Helen’s maze was
laid out for her and from that time forward she could only live within
those strict confines.

A final point to deal with here is whether or not this marriage included
sex. Look, this is a thorny issue, as it is with all polygamous
marriages, especially the teenage ones. There’s plenty of evidence
Joseph Smith was a sexual predator, so this question shouldn’t really
matter all that much, but it is important for some people and for some
reasons so let’s touch on the issue. If you don’t want to hear about
sexual assault or it may trigger you for any reason, maybe skip forward
about 5 minutes.

Would Heber and Vilate have given their only teenage daughter to a
37-year-old man knowing full well he was going to rape her? Yes. As is
the case in most religious sects that include a patriarchal polygamous
dynamic, this is common, even today. What evidence would we expect to
find from this Victorian era that this marriage included a sexual
dynamic? None. We can only infer based on a few pieces of data.

First datum, Joseph Smith was a sexual predator and it’s entirely
plausible that many of these polygamous marriages involved a sexual
dynamic.

Second datum comes from a late antagonistic source named Catherine Lewis
who claimed to be a friend of Helen at this time. Lewis claimed that
Helen objected to the marriage after finding out everything it included,
like maybe being raped by the prophet. Here’s the quote of Helen from
Lewis:

> “I would never have been sealed to Joseph had I known it was anything
> more than ceremony. I was young, and they deceived me, by saying the
> salvation of our whole family depended on it.”

Like I said, it’s a late antagonistic quote and there are issues with
some of the other content before and after this actual line.

Third datum comes from the change in Helen’s mood and how worried her
parents were with her wellbeing after the marriage. If the protectionist
tone of Heber’s letters throughout 1843 and the poem she penned are
evidence of her general shift in mood, it could imply she suffered a
series of traumatic experiences associated with the marriage, which is
entirely understandable.

The fourth and final point of data used to determine if sex was involved
is a little complicated. It comes from the 1892 Temple Lot hearing. This
hearing is complicated but suffice it to say, a few of Joseph’s wives
were called to testify in court about their marriages to Joseph Smith.
Eliza Partridge and Lucy Walker were called to the stand and testified
that they, indeed, had slept with Joseph Smith. The fact that Helen Mar
Kimball was alive at the time and wasn’t called to testify in that
hearing lends itself to the possibility that there wasn’t a sexual
dynamic because she would have been a star witness for the Hedrickites
if she and Joseph had had sex. However, she was 14 when she was married
to Joseph Smith, so her testifying in court that she was raped by the
prophet at age 14 in 1892 when Mormonism was being squashed by the U.S.
Government for their practice of polygamy really wouldn’t look good.
That may explain why she wasn’t presented as a witness. There were
plenty of other teenage polygynous marriages happening in Utah at this
time and the Utah Mormons probably didn’t want that kind of attention
drawn to their practices while their prophets and apostles were in
hiding to escape arrest.

The resounding conclusion about historical evidence from Helen that any
sex was involved is that she never would have recorded it in the first
place. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, especially when
it comes to private life-changing trauma like sexual assault by a person
regarded as the gatekeeper to heaven. Helen was coerced and pushed into
this marriage and she had absolutely no control over the situation. Her
life and eternity were chosen for her and it would have been her fault
if she abandoned those choices; only damnation awaited those who denied
such proposals.

Now that we know some of Helen Mar Kimball’s story, and trust me folks,
we barely scratched the surface, maybe we can take some lessons from her
writings and experiences. Maybe one day Helen Mar Kimball will be more
than just a common attack line against Joseph Smith after erroneously
calling him a pedophile. I’ll go ahead and let her take us out for the
night.
