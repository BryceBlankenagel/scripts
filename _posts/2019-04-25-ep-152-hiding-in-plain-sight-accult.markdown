Ep 152 – Hiding in Plain Sight; Accult

On this episode, we take a brief foray into the magic world view of
early Mormon leaders. From astrology to divination to scrying to
palmistry, many early leaders of the church were influenced by the magic
that underpins Protestant Christian mysticism. Instead of talking about
Joseph Smith and his seer stones, we take a look at other prominent
early Mormons to attempt to construct their beliefs systems that primed
them for belief in the early church. Also, a brief listener mail segment
to round out the show\!

It’s been busy over here at Ground Gnomes mobile studios so I’m warning
you at the onset that this episode might be a little shorter than most
historical timeline episodes. Last episode you heard was a presentation
for a local post-Mormon meetup group in St. George. Some of you may have
also seen the recent Mormon Stories interview on the Spalding theory
that just aired on their facebook group page earlier this week, soon to
be on the actual podcast feed and Mormon stories website. And finally,
when this episode airs I’ll be on my way to Sunstone in Short Creek
where I’ll be conducting interviews of attendees, which will comprise
next week’s episode before we return to the regular swing of things.

So, what’s on the docket today? Well, a little peak behind the curtain
here. D. Michael Quinn is the keynote speaker and I’d really like to
interview him while there. I’ve had no confirmation whatsoever that I’ll
be able to, but Lindsay Park has set me up in a room near the actual
symposium to conduct interviews and she’s given me first choice of what
to air on this feed and I’ll give the rest to Sunstone to do with what
they please. That means, I hope I’ll be able to interview Dr. Quinn, but
there’s no guarantee, but what I can guarantee is that whoever we have
on for next week’s show is sure to be an elect interview with a
supremely called individual.

As for today, I thought we’d tackle an interesting subject in early
Mormonism. I’ve been brushing up on Early Mormonism and the Magic World
View, one of Quinn’s most well-known books on the early church. It’s
something that seems like it’s been done and done so many times in this
sphere of post and secular Mormonism and we’ve broached the subject here
a few times in the past when the subject matter has called for it. The
thing is, the magic world view of the 19<sup>th</sup> century is truly a
bottomless well of information that is so crucial to understanding the
cultural frame of reference into which Mormonism was born.

What do I mean by that? Well, we can study Mormon history and the people
who converted to it till the day we die, but if we don’t understand the
superstitious mindset which allowed early Mormonism to flourish, it
becomes much harder to understand why it has become so successful today.
Further, we need to understand how these magical underpinnings influence
the church today. All religion is superstition, and to know what
superstition is considered unapproved, simply ask the superstition held
by the majority of people in any given area and they’ll be certain to
tell you.

When we examine superstition of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century, it becomes
clear that it’s a set of beliefs many of us find laughable today. People
staring at rocks in hats, or using witch hazel sticks to find buried
treasure seems otherworldly to us today, but it was how superstitious
people sought to understand the world around them. Another point worth
noting, superstition doesn’t ever go anywhere, it just grows, adapts,
and evolves as competing superstitions, the secular world, and the
scientific method push these praxes into antiquity.

When an athlete wears a lucky pair of socks, why? That’s a superstition,
albeit utterly benign with the exception of increased foot stank and
risk of fungal growth. On the other end, priests walking through a
congregation with a massive smoking incense bong or an annual pilgrimage
to the mountains of northern Mexico for Peyote cacti is a much more
involved and consequential form of superstition. Regardless, they all
involve some level of belief in a realm that can’t be observed or placed
in a test tube, but still influences, or is influenced by, our actions.
Now, a lot of this can come down to confirmation bias. The athlete
wearing the lucky socks wins 5 games and looses 5 games, they’re gunna
remember the wins and forget the loses. A person gets blessed by a
priest with good fortune and they lose their family and home to a fire
they’re gunna call it divine providence when the family bible wasn’t
burned up.

From a skeptical perspective we can see how this plays out, but for the
people believing in it, it’s much harder to see the naturalistic world
that actually underpins our subjective realities. But how do we trace it
back? So we have a corporatized multi-billion dollar organization with
over 150 massive temples and thousands of meeting houses around the
world where people believe that God is an alien who grew up with his
wives on the planet nearest the star Kolob, but how did it get to this
point? Mormonism wasn’t born out of a vacuum; it is quintessentially
Americanized Protestantism with myriad superstitious beliefs impregnated
in nearly every piece of its doctrine and theology. Superstitions that
hide in plain sight. Take a hard look at the Nauvoo and Salt Lake
Temples, the symbolism, the stars, moons, astrological symbols, occult
hexagonal stars, the architecture of the six spires, the angel that
initially adorned the Nauvoo temple, all of it comes down to deeper
symbolism that hides. The occult. That’s a working definition of occult
in the 19<sup>th</sup>-century, merely that which is hidden from plain
view. Occult practices are varied and fascinating. Occult may seem like
something singular you can put a finger on, but occult is more like a
label ascribed to many different practices. Folk magic is even a large
umbrella term that is used nearly synonymously with occult, but they
aren’t the same. Folk magic is a term usually relegated to protection
charms, divination or scrying, along with some herbal remedy medicinal
practices, and some other practices, whereas the occult usually
incorporates much deeper and more time-consuming practices such as spell
circles invoked in folk magic, symbolism in numbers and numerology,
astrology, sciomancy, necromancy, and other such controversial
practices.

To simplify a little bit, a farmer might dabble in folk magic by putting
a sigil over the door to their barn to keep it from burning down, while
an occultist might spend entire nights in practices of seances,
channeling, magic circles, treasure-digging, binding or conjuring
spirits, and even the occasional blood magick spell. Add into the
complexity, some practitioners of these various arts may draw arbitrary
lines as to what superstitions they buy into, verses what they regard as
bunk, juggling, or con-work. A person may wholeheartedly believe
astrology to be a true way to dictate the conduct of their day, while at
the same time calling a guy who uses divining rods idle and shiftless
folk. All the while, both people believe in a trinitarian
Judeo-Christian god and invoke the name of Jesus Christ in their
protection spells. Mormons today will laugh at somebody who puts
crystals underneath their pillow to fend off evil spirits all while
wearing their garments with symbols cut into the cloth as protection
amulets against any physical or spiritual harm.

My point is, the lines separating superstitions are blurry and
arbitrary, which makes the entire subject of folk magic in early
Mormonism incredibly complex. This also makes it hard to not see
everything in early Mormonism through a magic world view lens. For
example, Jo performing a certain ceremony on a certain day may have just
been the day it happened, or he may have deliberately planned it on that
day because it was astrologically favorable to his governing planet,
Jupiter. We can’t see the world through his eyes, we don’t know his
motivations, so it can be hard to ascribe magical significance to some
of his activities when they were steeped in magic and it’s also possible
to not claim something as magical when it may not have been.

The definitive work on this subject is Quinn’s book. I’m going to walk
us through a bit of his research today in hopefully understandable terms
in order to lay some magical foundation to Nauvoo Mormonism, where we
currently find our historical timeline.

Let’s get into it. It’s fairly widely known that Jo picked up magic from
his dad, Joseph Sr., or Big Daddy Cheese as we’ve always called him on
this show. A general practitioner of magic, known as an adept with
divining rods, Big Daddy Cheese knew his way around spells and
conjuration. As is the case with so much folk tradition and knowledge,
Jo Sr. passed these skills down to his sons, with Jo Jr. being one of
the most receptive of his brothers. Young Jo may not have attended
structured school for any lengthy period of time, but he was smart and
clever, and more importantly he was a sponge.

One of the major reasons Quinn’s book is so useful is he aptly
illustrates commonly sold books based on bookstore catalogues, newspaper
advertisements, and library registries. Throughout the 320 pages of his
books he documents hundreds of different occult and magic books
available for sale near the Smith home in New York. Now, just because
these books were for sale or available at the library does not
immediately follow that Jo read all of them. In fact, nobody really
claims that Jo was a constant bookworm in his younger years, even though
he had a substantial personal library by the end of his 14-year
ministry. However, the primary reason this information is useful is to
understand what all of Jo’s neighbors and friends were reading. A person
can read a book and communicate its contents to an eager inquirer in a
short amount of time. These books, coupled with the oral tradition
through which much of the occult was passed, illustrates the culture
which shaped the young Jo’s mind. Here’s a sampling from just one
paragraph when Quinn responds to polemical attacks concerning the
availability of some books to the Smith family. Before reading this
passage, simply consider what there was to do in frontier America at the
time. Drink with buddies, and read. Then take what you read and talk to
your buddies about it. No TV, no radio, no structured education, so all
of the down-time after farming endeavors were complete, or if you’re a
Smith, all the downtime in general, could be filled with reading and
chatting with friends about what they recently read, and then putting
that information into practice. Of course, the bookstore market
responded to this massive public interest in occult and magic books,
along with almanacs and farming guides and other necessities. Here we
go:

Needless to say, there was no dearth of sophisticated books, but most of
these are secular non-fiction or history books. The extensive lists
elsewhere in Quinn’s book illustrates just as much availability of
occult and magic books as the availability of these other non-fictions.
Once again, to claim that these books were available to Joseph Smith
does not immediately follow that he read every single one and believed
and understood the content. That’s would be absurd, nobody has that much
reading time, I don’t care who you are. What it does illustrate is that
these various books influenced the local farming towns and villages when
for many months of the year, farmers had nothing to do other than read
and spend time with neighbors and friends. These books, in small
degrees, all influenced the cultural milieu of the nearby towns
surrounding Palmyra, Jo’s teenage and young adulthood stomping grounds.
Jo may not have read these books, but his neighbors probably did and
then they would get together a few times a week and talk about what
they’d just learned. For an intellectual sponge like Joseph Smith,
this would have accelerated his basic knowledge of dozens of disparate
concepts to some level of passing familiarity. Couple that with his
personal ego and need to be the smartest guy in the room and as a young
adult Jo became an expert on everything from scrying, to astrology, to
unknown languages.

An interesting cultural detail worth noting at this time, Egyptomania
was in full-swing. Western cultures were fascinated and vexed by this
elusive ancient culture and the mysteries it contained. People were
beginning to learn about a culture so foreign to them and the fact that
ancient Egyptian wasn’t known to be translated by American academia by
the early 1840s made it even more of a fascination. How were they
learning about this? Through reading newspapers and going to Egyptian
Antiquities exhibits, which only heightened the excitement and mystery.

Ancient Egypt still produces an entire realm of speculation today. How
were the pyramids built 4500 years ago in such a short time without
cranes and modern technology or leave any archaeological evidence of the
materials and tools used to build them? It must have been aliens\! How
did all the mounds, pyramids, and cities get built in America before the
enlightened Europeans got there?\! It must have been white people that
the Savage Indians killed off before Columbus got there\! History and
archaeology still hold many mysteries today and we’ve been digging and
studying for a couple centuries, but it was all so new to people in
early to mid-19<sup>th</sup>-century America.

Egypt was viewed as the central focus of ancient magic and occult.
Various fraternities who practiced magic and ceremonial ritualism made
fantastic claims about the ancient Egyptian roots of their practices. It
was widely known in the 19<sup>th</sup>-century that Free Masonry didn’t
actually descend from Solomon’s temple or ancient Egypt, but there were
many Masons back then, and even Mason today, who believed the ascendency
ritual to have spawned from these early cradles of civilization. All
magic traditions were inextricably linked in the magic world view. From
ancient Egypt to the mysteries on the plains of Eleusis, to the Zohar
and Cabala, to Jesus and his mysteries invoked at the last supper with
feet washing, to the post-enlightenment practices that delineated among
astrology, alchemy, divination, etc., all of these are westernized
interpretations of the same pursuit, understanding the spiritual realm
that underpins our mortal existence.

The introduction to the Book of Mormon invokes the pursuit of Egyptian
mysteries mingled with Jewish Cabala. Quinn’s take is as follows, with a
subsequent paragraph on the allure created by the mysterious Egyptian
magical world.

> In addition to the magic dimensions of some Book of Mormon names, the

It’s all an underlying thread, magic. It’s a world view that requires
magic to operate. Spirit courses through everything from the rocks to
the trees to industrial factories. Let’s not fool ourselves into
thinking this magic world view went anywhere. When people pray to god to
help them find their car keys, they eventually find them, regardless of
the prayer. When a person’s adrenaline kicks in and they swerve out of
the way of a toddler chasing a ball into the street, Jesus took the
wheel. When an athlete makes a saving throw to win the game, he thanks
Jesus he was wearing his lucky socks or he might have missed his mark.
When an actress wins an academy award, they credit God instead of their
tens of thousands of hours of practice, years in acting school, and
lifetime of achievements which led to that point. We see it every day.
Magic world views cut both ways.

We see New Orleans or Paradise California struck by huge natural
disasters, pastors run the preaching circuit telling their parishioners
that god is angry that we legalized gay marriage or didn’t outlaw
abortions. Ethnic or religious minorities are subjugated for decades or
centuries and when they retaliate by blowing up churches, it’s
persecution against the one true God and his people. A historic
cathedral built on the spoils of war and ethnocide burns down in Paris
and it’s fulfillment of prophecy because Mother Mary is disappointed
that Catholicism has gone too soft and multicultural since the 1960s.
Magic and superstition are pervasive and ubiquitous among most people
living today. Once again, the lines dividing approved of superstition
and heretical superstition are blurry, arbitrary, and adaptive.

Because we draw these arbitrary lines in superstition, it can be tough
for many historians, and even laypeople, to wrap their minds around the
superstitions that early Mormonism held to. Joseph Smith spoke to god
face to face and could read unknown languages, totally\! What? A seer
stone to find magic buried treasure?\! That’s absurd\! This is the
height of presentism. It’s an historical fallacy where we project the
values and beliefs of modern society on people living decades or
centuries ago. A point that strikes me about Joseph Smith is his
adaptability to different superstitions. His sponge-like mind from his
teenage and young adulthood poised him as an interesting and adaptable
person when it came to his own theology. He had an incredible ability to
learn about some new superstition and mold it into his own superstitious
beliefs without any trouble. The only times we see Jo rejecting any set
of superstitions is when he came into contact with other contemporary
religious leaders who would represent his market competitors. We’ve
discussed his derision of Millerite millennialism while preaching his
own version of millennialism and eschatology that was in many way
indistinct from William Miller. He decried Campbellite Disciple of
Christ theology but that was likely because Alexander Campbell had
published so much against Sidney Rigdon and Mormonism since its
inception. Ann Lee and the Universal Friend were anathema to Jo because
he couldn’t imagine a woman leading a religion or being a prophetess.
However, dead theologians like Emanuel Swedenborg and Conrad Beissel of
the Ephrata Cloister and proprietors of superstition like Peter Buchan
and Ebenezer Sibley presented ripe picking grounds to grow Jo’s personal
theology.

Early Mormonism was unique, but people arbitrarily grabbing points of
philosophy, theology, and superstition floating around them and
fashioning a new religion from that unorganized chaos was nothing new.

Jo’s treasure digging and scrying with Precious and Mr. Hat has been
done a thousand times on every Mormon history or Mormon-themed podcast.
We’ve discussed it a few times on this show. What I’m interested in is
the magic beliefs and practices of other early church leaders. If Jo was
a practitioner of magic, and his pre-Mormonism friends were almost
exclusively fellow magic-minded folks, it would be understandable that
his religion would appeal to other magic-minded folk. We know Oliver
Cowdery, primary scribe of the Book of Mormon, was quite the diviner
with his rod. The 1833 commandment given to him first included the
wording of the gift of the rod of nature. After Eber Howe’s explosive
expose was published in 1834 poking fun at the magic worldview of early
Mormons, the revelation was reworded to the “gift of Aaron”, completely
scrubbing the occult context of his divinatory practices.

Similarly, Alvah Beaman was a Palmyra resident before Mormonism, a
family friend of the Smiths. He was known as “a grate rodsman” born at
the beginning of the American revolution. He, along with another magic
practitioner even exhibited some mineral rods they used for divination
in the Kirtland Temple shortly before his death in 1837. His daughter, a
childhood friend of Joseph and his siblings, ten years his junior,
became his wife sometime probably in 1841. The Beaman family were some
of the earliest converts to the early New York-era church.

The Whitmers are an interesting example of a family as well. They
comprised 5 of the 8 original gold plate witnesses and roughly 30% of
the Book of Mormon was translated in the upper floor of their home in
Fayette, New York. They lived a mere 4 miles from the Ephrata Cloister
which was highly steeped in magic and Rosicrucianism. Let’s talk about
the Ephrata and Rosicrucianism before talking about the Whitmers and
magic. The Ephrata Cloister was founded by 3 guys in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania. The charismatic leader, Conrad Beissel is an enigmatic and
fascinating guy. He migrated from Germany and created the Ephrata
Cloister in 1732. They practiced celibacy, spiritual nirvana in a
Christian sense, held to the beliefs of Rosicrucianism, which we’ll
discuss in a minute, and also baptized people to grant posthumous
salvation for their dead loved ones, citing the same scripture in Paul
that Mormons use to theologically justify their posthumous baptisms for
the dead. This Ephrata Cloister was 4 miles from the Whitmer home in
Pennsylvania before they moved to Fayette, New York. This was a cloister
of a religious group like the Shakers in New Labanon, New York founded
around the same time as the Ephrata. It’s an entire community of
buildings in a little sequestered area in the forest. They wore stark
white robes, went through an ego dissolution with the help of a
mysterious white powder after a 40-day intensive fast and meditation
period, after which the initiate would receive a new name, like a temple
name. The last celibate initiate died in 1813 but believing
practitioners continued living in the buildings until the 1930s. The
Ephrata even provided medical service to over 200 revolutionary war
soldiers. The Ephrata was eventually absorbed into a larger German
Baptist congregation, but the buildings remained distinctly Ephrata.
Today the buildings are maintained by the Pennsylvania historical
society and you can see them yourself.

On the occult foundations of this German-Rosicrucian movement, Quinn
states on page 102:

> Out of Pennsylvania’s environment of religion and magic came
> early-nineteenth-century American contributions to the published texts
> of magic. In 1813 Johann Hohman printed an advertisement in a Reading
> newspaper for Der Freund in der Noth (The Friend in Need), a book of
> magic charms he recently published in that city. It was falsely
> designated as a 1790 publication at “Offenbach am Mayne in
> Deutschland” by a resident of Tyrol. Hohman borrowed the title and
> content from an occult manuscript that had been circulating as early
> as 1752 in Pennsylvania. In 1820 Hohman published his own Der Lange
> Verborgene Freund (The Long Hidden \[or Lost\] Friend). Reprinted the
> same year, by 1829 this popular handbook had five editions (one
> published in Ephrata). Hohman’s occult manual (a grimoire of white
> magic”) was the only known source for an inscription on one of the
> Smith family’s magic parchments.

Why is this important? Well, the Ephrata commune knew the importance of
a printing press in order to thrive in the ever-growing marketplace of
American Protestant Christianity. They printed books for themselves
using paper they made, as well as hired out jobs from other religions to
help pay the bills. Conrad Beissel, one of the founders of the group
even wrote his own hymn book with over 1,000 original compositions. The
fact that an occult handbook that was printed in German by the Ephrata
Community near where the Whitmer family lived, themselves
German-speaking first generation immigrants, was likely used as a source
for the Smith family magic lamen is rather striking. If you haven’t seen
the smith family lamen, google it right now. It’s a set of magic
parchments with various sigils and spells that Quinn expertly traces
back to the originations of each source occult handbook that was used to
construct every spell and sigil on the parchments. That’s basically the
entire premise of his book, seeking to explain the occult and magic
context that constructed those magic lamens and shaped Joseph Smith’s
theology and superstition. Needless to say, if the Whitmers had an
Ephrata connection, which hasn’t been actually documented but is easily
deduced from the available evidence, their connection to the occult is
certainly rather tenable. Further, we have statements from people who
knew the Whitmers prior to Jo appearing on the scene. They weren’t
always viewed as favorable, especially by their preacher from whose
congregation they defected upon joining Mormonism.

He said:

> “I am acquainted with the Whitmers… they are gullible to the highest
> degree and even believe in witches. Hiram Page is likewise full of
> superstition.”

Continuing on a couple paragraphs about the Whitmers and their Ephrata
connection with occult and mysticism from page 239 of Quinn’s book:

> The minister’s description fit the cultural background of the Whitmer
> family before they moved to New York. The Whitmers were originally
> Pennsylvania Germans, and these early American ethnics were known for
> their almost universal belief in witchcraft and counter-charms against
> witchcraft. The Whitmer family’s New York minister recorded that peter

> county’s 1790 federal census listed Peter Whitmer at Cocalico
> Township, which included Ephrata where Rosicrucian mystics were

> 
> In 1831 ten Palmyra residents echoed the Whitmer family’s minister at

> denial of the fact that intelligent people believed in the
> “superstition” he described. Also, one person’s “superstition” is
> always another’s devout faith.

It think it’s safe to say that every single person in the Whitmer family
were very superstitious people. Beyond that, every member of the Smith
family, Oliver Cowdery, and Hiram Page were all superstitious. Martin
Harris was legendarily superstitious. That’s a way of saying every
single person who signed those witness statements in the beginning of
every copy of the Book of Mormon believed in the magic world view.

Even the number of witnesses had astrological significance. From 194 in
Quinn’s book:

> They \[the gold plates\],… were joined by eight witnesses who saw no

It wasn’t just Joseph Smith, all of these people believed in divination,
sciomancy, conjuration of spirits, necromancy, scrying, rhabdomancy,
phrenology, astrology, slippery treasures with guardian spirits,
elemental spirits, animal magnetism, palmistry, amulets and protection
spells, charms and counter-charms, witchcraft, sorcery, numerology,
burying spellbound parchments in the corner of their houses to keep them
from burning down, and nearly any other superstition we could conceive
of today. Why should we trust their word on this ONE superstition that
gold plates, written by Native Americans, were given to Joseph Smith by
a conjured angel, who gave him magic rocks to be able to translate it
into the Book of Mormon? What possibly qualifies them as credible? But,
as Quinn so aptly put it, “one person’s “superstition” is always
another’s devout faith.”

Let’s rewind a little to get a foundation for Rosicrucianism because
Quinn invoked that term a few times and I said it twice before as well.
What is Rosicrucianism? As the claimed history states, it began as a
fraternity of physicians and mystics. The founder is an anonymous legend
known only as “Father Brother Christian Rosi Cross,” who supposedly
formed the fraternity in 1407, being born in 1378. According to legend,
it was organized with 8 original disciples who were roaming celibate
physician-mystics. They were to administer healings through anointing
oil or vegetable powders among other medicinal methods, they were to
never accept money for their services, and took a
17<sup>th</sup>-century version of the Hippocratic Oath. Each member was
responsible for finding a single mentee as replacement value for
himself. Historians are able to trace the actual foundation of
Rosicrucianism to 3 manifestos that served as the canonical foundation.
“These were the Fama Fraternitatis RC (The Fame of the Brotherhood of
RC, 1614), the Confessio Fraternitatis(The Confession of the Brotherhood
of RC, 1615), and the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosicross a.D.
MCCCCLIX (1617).”

Once these manifestos were published, Rosicrucianism began to see an
influx of those interested in seeking a codified religion of Christian
esoteric and mystical arts. The manifestos themselves, and thus the
foundation of the fraternal order, was heavily influenced by old
philosophies that were quite popular like Cabala, Hermeticism, and
Alchemy. Some historians have even noted how Rosicrucianism influenced
early Freemasonry as it was gaining traction in Scotland and other
European countries. Daniel Mogling created a picture as an early
initiate into Rosicrucianism dated to 1618. You can find it on Wikimedia
open source and it is FASCINATING\! The esoteric symbolism is replete
through every aspect of the illustration, it would take years to decode
everything. Rosicrucianism was the philosophy that gave birth to the
Ephrata Cloister that clearly influenced the Whitmer family; priming
them to believe in the magic and superstition they were presented with
when Jo and Oliver Cowdery darkened their doorstep with the incomplete
BoM manuscript in hand.

So we know the Whitmers, Smiths, and Cowderys, and many of the early New
York-era converts were into the magic worldview, but how much deeper
does it go? Let’s talk about Bloody Brigham Young for a minute. Bloody
Brigham is a fascinating character when it comes to examining his magic
world view. First off, when it comes to scrying using a seer stone, it
was well-known that only certain magicians had the gift of seeing that
which can’t be detected with the natural eyes. JS was widely regarded as
having this ability, but Bloody Brigham was quick to let people know in
Utah that he didn’t have the same ability.

From Quinn’s book again on page 251

Seer stones underlay much of the early Utah-territory church. Quin
relates a story of a Samuel R. Parkinson who lost some mules. Parkinson
went to a local seer and borrowed the stone. He didn’t see the location
of the mules, but instead saw a pair of young women who he thought would
be his polygamous wives. Parkinson showed the stone to his first wife
who reportedly saw the same image. A few years later when the Parkinsons
were visiting an Idaho congregation, they spotted two sister who looked
like the image they both saw in the seer stone and they were wedded
Samuel Parkinson as his second and third wives.

George D. Watt, the guy responsible for the Journal of Discourses,
immigrated to Utah based on a vision he saw in a seer stone while living
in England. Bloody Brigham, far from decrying the use of seer stones,
endorsed their use, parroting what Jo had told him while he was Jo’s
apostle stating: “Joseph said there is a \[seer\] stone for every person
on earth… I don’t know \[sic\] that I have ever had a desire to have
one… The president of the priests has a right to the Urim and Thummim
which gives revelation.” The early church simply functioned on magic and
Bloody Brigham didn’t take any steps to stop it or curtail those
practices.

Where curtailing of the practices of seer stones actually did come into
play was when women would use them. A woman in Utah named Sophia
Romriell Rushton was using her seer stone to get her own revelations.
She gained a reputation in Utah as being a seer and therefore prophetess
of sorts, which could easily undermine the patriarchy and social order.
Heber the Creeper Kimball was quick to respond: “Those \[seer stones\]
were sacred things & to be used only by the priesthood…”.

Let’s talk Heber the Creeper Kimball for a minute because he practiced a
unique version of divination that is much more similar to the biblical
usage of the Urim and Thummim. Levitical priests using a Urim and
Thummim were basically painted stones they would cast after asking the
lord yes or no questions. However the stones landed, that was their
answer. Heber the Creeper practiced a form of divination, not by holding
sticks and watching how they pointed, but by holding his cane, asking
the lord a yes-no question, then dropping the cane, like chicken bones.
This is known as rhabdomancy and it was Heber’s preferred form of
divination.

Kimball’s justification for the endowment under Jo hearkens to magic and
a perfected version of Masonry. People today talk about how the temple
endowment ceremonies are based on Masonry, early church leaders knew
there were similarities, but they didn’t view it as derivative so much
as perfected.

> Apostle Heber C. Kimball, a Freemason for many years, expressed his
> view a month after receiving the Mormon endowment in 1842: “we have

> on paper fore they are not to be ritten… there is a similarity of
> preast Hood in masonary. Br Joseph ses Masonary was taken from
> preasthood but has become deg\[e\]nerated, but menny things are
> \[made\] perfect.

It wasn’t just the endowment, but the entire concept of sealing was
rooted in occultism and the magic worldview. The foundation of the
church on a seemingly random Tuesday in April was rooted in magic. Heber
Kimball was a practitioner among many of the earliest leaders of the
church.

Magic simply pervaded the early church leadership. Notably, today, if
you tour the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers museum, you’ll see in the
Bloody Brigham Young display case a small bloodstone amulet. I’ve
personally seen it and every one of you who’ve been in that museum may
have seen it or may not have noticed it. I would encourage anybody
hearing this, the next time you go to the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers
Museum, spend some time looking at this stone, it’s rather remarkable. I
saw it but knew nothing about it until this most recent read-through of
Quinn’s book.

Bloody Brigham wore a bloodstone around his neck as a protection amulet
the way every believing Mormon wears their garments as protection
amulets today. It was his magic lucky charm the way garments are a
temple magic lucky charm for millions of people today.

Protection amulets aren’t just limited to physical objects though.
Prominent Mormon Zebedee Coltrin converted in 1835 as a result of a
personal visionary experience. The Coltrin family practiced magic
incantations as a familial protection spell and kept the tradition alive
until around 1900. The spell was never written on paper but passed
orally through family members who memorized it perfectly to pass to the
next generation. It was a tradition existing for roughly 70 years in the
believing Coltrin family circle and probably existed within the family’s
personal magic beliefs long before Zebedee converted to the church.

William Clayton, Jo’s personal scribe in Nauvoo from early 1842 until
his death 2 years later, knew and saw everything that happened in the
church. The theocratic council of fifty minutes are in his hand. Much of
the Book of the Law of the Lord is in his hand. Most of Jo’s Nauvoo
journal is in his hand. This guy saw everything and believed in magic as
well. While in Utah, Clayton sent a letter to New York requesting some
pages of their finest blank parchment for, he said, to take some
records. Utah had plenty of paper so why not use that paper? Well, a
magic handbook from the 1820s helps us understand. This is Peter
Buchan’s Witchcraft Detected and Prevented…

> “A safeguard for an orchard, park, warran, or field, to take a Thief,

Peter Buchan’s book I just read from was extremely popular. The reason I
read that entire charm is because it talks about curious clean parchment
made of sleek skin, which is then cut and written upon in order to bind
a thief from carrying away your property. Seems crazy, right? Well, the
next charm is even more delightful:

> To drive away Ghosts, or Spirits that haunt a house.

> sprinkle the walls of the chamber you fancy is haunted with it, and no
> disturbance will happen if you turn your face when you go to repose to
> the eastward, when in bed, and say your prayers.

Like I said, that was a popular book in the 1820s when it was released
and reprinted in like 7 editions and was on sale in the Palmyra
bookstore where Jo really got into magic. This is the kind of
information we’re dealing with. And please, harbor no illusions that
this mindset has gone anywhere. People today believe in similar
practices, enchantments, spells, and smudging to drive haunting spirits
from their homes. Even if these magic beliefs and practices don’t seem
to have any effect on our lives today, I simply find it interesting that
there are people today who wear magic charms around their necks while
taking selfies on their iphones and send that information around the
globe in a few milliseconds. People used to believe witches literally
flew around on broomsticks but now a person can buy a personal jetpack
for as much as a house in Seattle. People will drive in their cars the
equivalent of 3 day’s walk in an hour so they can pray to a god that
condemns people who love somebody of the same gender or sends somebody
to hell for masturbating. It’s all superstition and it’s ubiquitous
among nearly every culture, ethnicity, geography, and group of people.

I guess a question remains, when did the lines in Mormonism get moved?
When did they walk back from seer stones and divination, but still hold
on to the garments as amulets and the magic spells spoken three times in
the temple and god being an alien and all that? When did they begin to
relegate the practices apologists try to remove Joseph Smith from into
the realm of folk magic, while still believing their own magic? It
really happened around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. By the
mid-1890s Utah was trying to gain statehood and integrate into the
broader mainstream of Protestantism. When Joseph F. Smith took over as
prophet, nearly all of the old guard from the original Kirtland and
Nauvoo Jo years had died off and no longer influenced the church. Joseph
F. Smith made a concerted effort to bring Utah into control. He instated
curfews, increased regulation of Sabbath day observance, banned
face-cards, tightened the ropes on coffee, tea, and alcohol, although it
was his successor who was largely responsible for really tightening down
on the alcohol part. Joseph F. Smith pushed magic to the fringes of
Mormon practice when he couldn’t directly snuff it out.

Yet Mormons today draw their arbitrary lines where they see fit. They
estrange a child because she’s reading wiccan books by candlelight or
he’s reading Harry Potter books and playing with a magic wand he cut
from a tree. It’s all superstition. It just so happens that 15 random
guys at the head of a multi-billion dollar organization, started by some
random guy 185 years ago, claim that only their specific form of
superstition will get you to their specific, Field of Reeds, their
Elysium, sorry, Valhalla, shit that’s wrong, SugarCandy Mountain?
Whatever, you know what I mean.
