Ep 154 – Jane and Emma

On this episode, as we enter the last half of 1843, an era of
good-feelings falls upon Nauvoo. The streets shined as if paved by gold
and the Mormons had beat the justice system again while polygamy was in
full swing\! We focus in on some of the pressures behind closed doors
the public wasn’t privy to. We hear the story of Jane Manning James and
her migration to Nauvoo, how she met the Smiths, came to live in the
Nauvoo Mansion, and her relationships with Emma and other women living
in the house. Then we hyperfocus on Emma and her constant inner battle
with polygamy.

Our timeline continues to saunter through the summer of 1843. Joseph
Smith had beat the legal system again after his release from the custody
of Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson. The sherrifs’ petition to bring the
Illinois militia into Nauvoo to affect a second arrest was denied by
Governor Thomas Carlin and Jo was safe for now. He’d dictated and
presented to Emma what came to be D\&C 132, the celestial commandment
from gods for men to take multiple wives. He had thousands of votes to
throw around however he saw fit in the upcoming Congressional and county
offices elections. He’d bargained with a popular lawyer running for
Congress to defend Jo in the July 1843 court in exchange for Jo’s vote,
with the implied understanding that the entire Mormon voting bloc would
go for Walker, the Whig congressional candidate, and we’ll see how that
plays out in the coming August 1843 election. In addition to politicians
in his pocket, progress on the Nauvoo Mansion was progressing quickly.
The Nauvoo Homestead was overcrowded with Jo, 6 of his wives, and all
the kids, Dr. Robert D. Bob-the-Builder Foster was making good progress
and the Mansion was ready to begin moving personal effects and furniture
in to. Talos’ Temple Crown was progressing at a promising pace as well.
The summer heat was blistering, but brick forges were burning away day
and night and buildings were going up faster than bricks could be
produced to construct. The Masonic lodge was a popular meeting place.
Public areas and mercantile shops were running at full-steam. The
Mormons were making goods, even though the products couldn’t compete
with cheaper imports from larger metropolitan and industrial areas. The
majority of the leadership were siding with Jo. With only a few notable
exceptions, Jo’s highest ranks were staffed with ultimately loyal
followers. However, Jo’s personal childhood friend, Orrin Pistol Packin’
Porter Rockwell was still languishing in a gentile prison in Missouri,
but the state didn’t have any hard evidence to convict him of the
Lilburn Boggs assassination attempt so he’d be out any time now.

What I’m trying to say is that nearing the end of 1843, Nauvoo was
entering an era of good feelings. There were still many pressures on Jo
and the leadership, much of it resulting from Wreck-it Bennett’s expose
and the public outcry, but Jo had nearly put that issue to bed with
multiple signed statements with thousands of signatures and declarations
of Mormon doctrine being strictly monogamous so the public outcry was
muted in many respects. Many of those living in or near Nauvoo adhering
to the theology of Mormonism simply regarded Bennett’s expose as a
propaganda piece and Jo continued to take and give plural wives in
secrecy. So, in spite of the fact that Jo was a self-declared Prophet,
he couldn’t see the future. He didn’t know what the next year held, he
couldn’t foresee his own doom less than a year in the future. He just
kept upping the ante and pushing boundaries to see how far the system
would bend without breaking.

That was the public face; everything was just fine in Nauvoo and this
faux prosperity was felt by the average members. Additionally, many of
the Quorum of Apostles were on various missions around the country to
disseminate Mormon anti-polygamy propaganda, which produced a dearth of
drama usually attendant when Nauvoo elites were congregated together for
too long. The streets shined as if paved with gold.

Behind closed doors was a different story. Crushing debt and high
unemployment, drama from polygamy and charges of infidelity,
ever-increasing secrecy with clandestine Mormon ceremonies, malaria and
overall sickness picking off the weakest of the tribe, robbing and
unsolved murders; all of these lived in the shadows of Nauvoo alleys.
For Jo, the greatest challenge he faced was keeping peace in the home
while conducting himself in incredibly controversial ways. Simply put,
Emma wasn’t ready to accept polygamy as divinely sanctioned. Jo had
hidden most of his wives from Emma, but when that didn’t work he
proposed bargaining, then when all else failed, Jo just outright
commanded Emma that he was going to have lots of wives and she just had
to deal with it. They bickered constantly to the point that even outside
observers came to be suspicious of what caused so much discord in the
Smith family home.

The main issue between Jo and Emma was that she was cut out of the loop
with respect to so many things happening in the church. She’d been by
Jo’s side, his coconspirator on the Mormon payroll since 1830, she’d
always been there working with her husband to further the expansion of
the Mormon empire. But, because she wasn’t sold on polygamy, Jo was
slowly cutting her off from the meetings behind closed doors. But it
wasn’t just Jo cutting Emma out, it was her friends as well. Her closest
advisors and counsellors in the Relief Society were engaged in plural
marriage with Jo. 5 young adult women living in the same home as Jo and
Emma were all sealed to Jo. Because of her vacillation between
begrudging acceptance of, and vitriolic opposition to, polygamy, she
couldn’t be trusted. Jo and his inner-circle of celestial initiates
recognized Emma as a potential threat and she became more socially
isolated from her closest friends for the past 12 years of her life.

A brief passage from Mormon Enigma to illustrate this point:

> Joseph’s choice of women as plural wives gradually put a wedge between
> Emma and her friends as long as she remained either ignorant of the
> practice or opposed it. By late summer 1843 most of Emma’s friends had
> either married Joseph or had given their daughters to him. Her
> sister-in-law, Agnes Coolbrith, was married to Joseph; another
> sister-in-law, Mary Fielding, had consented to the marriage of her
> husband Hyrum Smith and her sister Mercy. At least five women in her
> own household were Joseph’s plural wives. Whether Emma knew about them
> or not, the women would not have been sympathetic to Emma while she
> opposed plural marriage. As a result, she became isolated from her
> friends and associates, and through the next four years this isolation
> would become more and more acute.

This was a general theme throughout most of 1843 both before and after
the plural marriage revelation was given. Emma was a member of fight
club, but she was cut out of project mayhem because she had too much
critical thinking and a strong backbone. Newell and Avery put it
wonderfully in their book, Mormon Enigma, “There is no evidence that
Emma opposed Joseph on any doctrine other than plural marriage.” But
Mormon theology and doctrine had been teetering on the edge of evolution
to a free-love sex ring for over a decade. Many of Jo’s theological
expansions in Kirtland and Nauvoo can be chased down to the idea of
plural marriage. But Jo finally had an identifier and terminology that
made it seem divinely inspired. Instead of polygamy, it was the new and
everlasting covenant. Instead of plural marriage it was celestial
sealing. Instead of telling your first wife to just deal with you having
multiple wives, it was known as the Law of Sarah, that she was required
to accept of her sister-wives or suffer damnation. The quorum of the
anointed, or the Holy Order, was the culmination of these clandestine
doctrines being practiced openly, but only behind closed doors with
fellow initiates. Anybody opposed to this, or even thought to be opposed
to polygamy, never were granted access to these clandestine meetings.

Notably, women weren’t allowed to be part of the endowment practiced in
these clandestine meetings. Today’s endowment is solely practiced in
temples, but Nauvoo Mormonism had yet to complete their temple and
practicing anything in the Kirtland temple was out of the question and
over 600 miles away. The endowments under Joseph Smith’s leadership were
most-often conducted in the upper floor of the masonic lodge, or the
upper floor of Jo’s red brick store, where many community functions were
held. The Anointed Quorum most frequently met in the red brick store
where the endowments were practiced, initiates were inducted into
clandestine Mormon ceremonies, and plural marriages were sealed.

Jo’s endowment was being practiced for over a year by the late summer of
1843. No explicit writings of his intentions survive, but it seems he’d
always wanted to induct Emma into the Quorum of the Anointed to be
sealed to her for time and all eternity, but refused to do so until she
relented on her opposition to polygamy. With the production of the
plural marriage revelation and Emma’s assent to allowing Jo to marry the
Partridge sisters, the Lawrence sisters, and Lucy Walker, the Elect Lady
of Mormonism was finally in the proper place to allow her initiation
into the endowment ceremony. Finally, after more than a year of explicit
knowledge and opposition to polygamy, Emma’s capitulation to Jo’s
demands of having multiple wives granted her entrance to the quorum of
the anointed as the first Mormon woman to enjoy the blessings of the
endowment. But this didn’t happen in isolation, many other issues were
happening simultaneously which complicated matters.

One of these issues was the constant stress on Nauvoo housing and
infrastructure with the constant flow of immigrants. The Immigration
Fund was in full swing, bringing European converts across the Atlantic
and up the Mississippi to the tune of thousands of people by the
beginning of 1844. Nauvoo was already short on possible housing and
every building that was completed had 10 possible families who were
dying to get their own home instead of living in hastily constructed
shacks with huge groups of people from other families.

While the Smiths were moving into the newly-completed Nauvoo Mansion
house in July and August of 1843, a specific group of people arrived to
Nauvoo seeking refuge among fellow followers of the Mormon Mahomet. Not
only from Europe, but from all over the country, people were converting
to the new one-true religion and flocking to Nauvoo to live in this new
Zion. One of these domestic converts was named Jane. From her own
reminiscence when she was living in Utah in the year 1900 including a
brief autobiographical sketch:

> When a child only six years old \[in 1828\], I left my home and went

Jane and her family were now in Nauvoo and seeking a meeting with this
nearly-mythical figure they’d only known through correspondence with
missionaries who’d converted them, the great Joseph Smith. This
reminiscence doesn’t include dates so I’ve added the years at the
beginning from other sources. The exact time of year also isn’t
specified but from details included in Jane’s account we can understand
it likely occurred sometime in September or October of 1843, as the
nights froze the dew and morning sun melted it away. We’ll discuss the
intervening time from July to autumn of 1843 in the coming weeks, but
we’re reading Jane for now for the sake of continuity, so please bear
with me as we continue to understand her story.

And just like that, Jane, in a time of need with no home or even clothes
beyond what she wore when she got to Nauvoo, was taken into the Smith
Mansion house as a temporary resident. Jane found in Nauvoo a sense of
sorority and camaraderie she hadn’t before experienced. She documents
these intimate details of the Smith family and their hospitality among
other interactions. Eliza Partridge’s journal from the time reveals that
Jane became good friends with her peers living in the Smith mansion for
the few months she remained there during the winter of 1843-44. Jane
even had a brief moment with Lucy Mack Smith, who Jane refers to as
“Mother Smith,” that clearly left a profound impression on her.

> I had to pass through Mother Smith's room to get to mine.  She would
> often stop me and talk to me.  She told me all Brother Joseph's
> troubles and what he had suffered in publishing the Book of Mormon. 
> One morning I met Brother Joseph coming out of his mother's room.  He
> said, "Good morning," and shook hands with me.  I went into his
> mother's room; she said, "Good morning; bring me that bundle from my
> bureau and sit down here."  I did as she told me.  She placed the
> bundle in my hands and said, "Handle this and then put in the top
> drawer of my bureau and lock it up.  After I had done it she said,
> "Sit down.  Do you remember that I told you about the Urim and Thummim
> when I told you about the Book of Mormon?"  I answered, "Yes, ma'am." 
> She then told me I had just handled it.  “You are not permitted to see
> it, but you have been permitted to handle it,” \[she said\]. “ You
> will live long after I am dead and gone and you can tell the
> Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and
> Thummim.[\[8\]](https://history.lds.org/article/jane-manning-james-life-sketch?lang=eng#_ftn8)”

This was a rare occurrence in early Mormonism. The seer stones were
revered as holy and sacred to all who knew of them and Jane here was
granted a brief moment of holding one of the seer stones in a pouch for
a brief moment. The next interaction Jane relates is between her and
Emma, which seems to allude to something between the lines that caused
Jane a lot of trouble in Utah under the leadership of Bloody Brigham
Young.

> Sister Emma asked me one day if I would like to be adopted to them as
> their child and I did not answer her.  She said, "I will wait a while
> and let you consider it."  She waited two weeks before she asked me
> again. When she did, I told her, "No, Ma'am\!" because I did not
> understand or know what it meant.  They were always good and kind to
> me, but I did not know my own mind.  I did not comprehend.

And with that small interaction, Jane refused to join the celestial
Smith family during Jo’s lifetime, and therefore forfeited eternal
sealing to the prophet and Elect Lady of Mormonism, which she would come
to regret when Bloody Brigham sealed her to the Smiths as their eternal
slave. Jane wasn’t even allowed into the endowment house where the
sealing was performed for herself, instead another woman stood as proxy
for her while she waited outside.

To understand Jane’s refusal of Emma’s proposal, it’s important to
understand how Jane likely understood the proposal in the first place.
Jane said herself that she did not comprehend or understand what the
adoption/sealing meant. Emma made this proposal soon after Jane had
arrived in Nauvoo once all her family had found homes in town and Jane
had taken up residence in the Nauvoo mansion at the age of 21. She was
surrounded all day by half a dozen women who were plurally sealed to
Joseph. Understandably, with the gossip mill that was Nauvoo, Jane
quickly became aware of the practice of plural marriage happening in
Nauvoo. When Emma first proposed for Jane to be sealed to the Smiths,
Jane likely didn’t understand what was meant. Emma said that she’ll wait
a while for Jane to reconsider. During the following two weeks between
the first proposal and Emma’s second proposal, it seems Jane became
aware of everything that was included in the practice of Mormon polygamy
through the relationships she built with her fellow young-adult women
living in the same house, all of which were sealed to Jo. After learning
about what polygamy really included, it’s understandable that Jane
vehemently refused the second proposal Emma made two weeks after the
first. She was literally surrounded by Jo’s wives while most of them
were barred from engaging in social activities for fear their secrets
would be discovered. That made for a lot of down time for all these
young women to talk while doing chores around the massive Nauvoo Mansion
which was now doubling as the most prestigious hotel of Nauvoo.

Jane reported a conversation with Jo’s young adult wives while she was
living in the Nauvoo Mansion in a life sketch she provided in 1890 to
Joseph F. Smith.

> “Brother Joseph’s four wives, Emily Partridge, Eliza Partridge, Maria
> and Sara Lawrence, and myself, were sitting discussing Mormonism and
> Sarah said ‘What would you think if a man had more wives than one?’ I
> said, ‘That is all right\!’ Maria said, ‘Well, we are all four Brother
> Joseph’s wives\!’ I jumped up and clapped my hands and said, ‘That’s
> good.’ Sarah said, ‘She is all right, she believes it all now.’”

This was reported in 1890 while she was living in Utah. That was the
story of Jane Manning James and how she came to live in Nauvoo with the
Smith family. Memories, especially when reported in a letter to one of
the highest-ranking church leaders in the Utah Territory, have a way of
sliding behind rose-colored lenses. How Jane Manning James felt at the
time about plural marriage when talking to her peers and possible future
sister-wives doesn’t seem to comport with her earlier refusal of the
proposal by Emma. That’s not a problem, it just needs further context to
make proper sense, and I think the explanation to reconcile these
seemingly different positions on sealing stems from Emma herself.

What would Jane have learned from these conversations? Jane, upon her
arrival to Nauvoo, became one of the quickest initiates into the
practice of sealing and plural marriage in Nauvoo. She ascended from
convert-immigrant to a Cloistered Sister, as Wreck-it Bennett would have
called her, in a matter of weeks. Most women who were members for over a
decade by this point didn’t gain the amount of knowledge and
intelligence that Jane was privy to in a matter of a few weeks. Imagine,
if you will, the way Jane saw Emma interacting with the young women
living in the house. The coldness with which Emma approached most of
these relationships must have been relatively off-putting until Jane
learned that they were all sister-wives, which would have allowed quite
a few puzzle pieces to fall together in her mind.

Consider the root of what caused Emma to treat these young women
harshly. The inner turmoil Emma suffered from Jo’s libertine nature must
have weighed heavily on her conscious. That turmoil coupled with her
ever-expanding wealth and corporate power in Nauvoo, conducting business
deals with men who never thought they’d be signing contracts with a
woman in their lifetimes. Jo was sometimes in hiding for fear of arrest,
which forced Emma to step up to the plate and take care of his shoddy
business practices. Emma was also planning an escape route in late 1843.
She was entertaining the idea of divorcing Jo, for many understandable
reasons, and had to plot a secret escape to be able to leave Nauvoo with
the divorce and get her kids away from the dangerous criminal that was
her husband. She had to set herself up financially to be able to support
the departure and any complications that may have come along with the
divorce and fleeing from Nauvoo. Accordingly, throughout July to October
of 1843, Emma acquired a ton of property, most of it transferred from Jo
to her. Some of those transfers may have been deals brokered between
Emma and Jo for Emma to give her consent for Jo taking more wives, but
of course that’s speculative at best. Regardless of the reasoning behind
these land and property transfers, the end-result became a complete
fiasco between Emma and Brigham for years following the deaths of Jo and
Hyrum Side-kick Abiff Smith in Carthage 9 months in the future from
where we currently are. Emma had a lot going on in her own mind and
bringing more young women into the home almost always ensured future
relations between them and her husband. Emma’s frustrations and internal
conflicts were projected onto these young women who had even less
control over the situation than Emma had. This coldness even extended
into her interactions with men in Nauvoo as she treated William Clayton,
Brigham Young, and others of Jo’s closest acolytes with contempt. Here’s
a few extracts of Emma’s interpersonal conduct from Newell and Avery’s
biography of Emma, Mormon Enigma:

> No matter what its origin, \[Emma\] opposed the doctrine \[of
> polygamy\]. She was not without power in the struggle with Joseph over
> it. Four days after her return from St. Louis Emma exerted her
> strongest leverage. She threatened divorce.
> 
> \[William\] Clayton reported under the date of August 16, 1843, “This
> A.M. Joseph told me that sin\[c\]e Emma came back from St. Louis, she
> had resisted the P\[rinciple\] in toto, and he had to tell her he
> would relinquish all for her sake. She said she would give him E and E
> P\[artridge\] but he knew if he took them she would pitch on him, &
> obtain a divorce & leave him. He however told me he should not
> relinquish anything.” In the most serious crisis of their marriage,
> Joseph backed down. He told Emma that he would give up his wives. But
> he confided to Clayton that he did not intend to keep his word.
> 
> Five days after Joseph agreed to “relinquish all” Emma found two
> letters in his pocket from Eliza \[R.\] Snow, who was still at the
> Morley settlement \[after her quick removal from the homestead\]. Emma
> confronted William Clayton with them and asked if he had delivered
> them to Joseph. Clayton denied being the courier; he said Emma “seemed
> vexed and angry.” He also recorded that Joseph told him Emma had said
> some “harsh words.” Two months later Eliza would visit Nauvoo, on
> October 10, and would afterward confide to her diary, “Some
> circumstances of very peculiar interest occur’d during my visit to the
> City. Every thing connecting with our affections is engraven on the
> heart, and needs not the perpetuating touch of the sculptor.” The
> entry hints that Emma’s suspicions about Eliza and Joseph were not
> unfounded. On August 19 Eliza Snow penned some verses for Eliza
> Partridge, who had begun to chafe under Emma’s surveillance…
> 
> Still smarting from finding Eliza’s letters to Joseph the previous
> day, Emma went for a short carriage ride with her husband on August
> 22. She called on the Lucian Woodworth family while Joseph attended to
> some buinsess at the temple. Emma apparently did not know that the
> Woodworths’ sixteen-year-old daughter Flora had been Joseph’s plural
> wife since spring. What probably began as a casual social visit
> resulted in a confrontation between Emma and Flora when Emma
> discovered that Joseph had given Flora a gold watch. She would have
> recognized the implications of such a gift, since he had also given
> one to Eliza Snow. Joseph returned just as Emma “was demanding the
> gold watch” from Flora, and he reprimanded her. Once in the carriage,
> however, Emma vented her own frustrations. Joseph told Clayton she

Harsh measures to stop Emma from abusing him. I assume Jo never realized
all of these troubles in the home were a direct result of his own
actions. But hey, he was just doing what the voices in his head told him
to do so that makes him a great guy.

Emily Partridge recalls this tumultuous time in the Women’s Exponent of
Utah in the 1880s:

> of Joseph Smit hand bound me to him for time and all eternity.

Emma’s internal conflict throughout most of 1843 caused her to turn her
attention to affairs outside of the church. She was president of the
Relief Society from its formation in March of 1842, but throughout all
of 1843 she only attended two of the meetings. She spent a lot of time
travelling to and from St. Louis to pick up supplies for the Red Brick
Store as well as managing other familial affairs in her growing family
as a result of polygyny. She was writing many letters to important
people to put out fires that Jo was setting all around town. One of
these came as a result of Hingepin Sidney Rigdon’s questionable loyalty.

Ever since the Wreck-it Bennett meltdown and his expose was published,
many entertained thoughts that Rigdon was actually colluding with
Bennett to bring down the prophet. Rigdon was postmaster of Nauvoo at
this time, the only real government job bringing income from the federal
government. Jo had repeatedly accused Rigdon of throwing out Jo’s mail
or letting other people see Jo’s letters before Jo actually received
them. There may have been something like that going on, but separating
fact from accusations is a tough matter here. Regardless of what really
took place and whether or not Rigdon was screening Jo’s mail to help aid
Bennett in taking down the Mormon Mahomet, Emma joined in the fray.

> \[A\] problem with Sidney Rigdon had been festering for some time.
> Joseph had addressed their differences earlier, and they had been
> temporarily resolved. William Marks reported that at that time “Sister
> Emma had a good many feelings against Elder Rigdon, but they are all
> done away. She has said within a few months, and in fact within one
> week, that she was on as good terms with Elder Rigdon as she had ever
> been since he was a member of the church.” But the strong feelings
> between her husband and Rigdon flared again.

The tension between Jo and Rigdon would continue for another few months
before it was finally resolved, but we can clearly see from this passage
written by William Marks, as well as letters exchanged between Rigdon
and Emma, that she was willing to go to bat for her husband when it was
for the overall benefit of him or the church.

Emma’s headspace and her relationship to Jo were very complex at this
time. We can’t see what truly happened; historians can only piece
together from outside sources occurrences that hopefully reveal a window
into this complexity. They dearly loved each other, but they also had
serious issues in their relationship. They both tried to put on the best
possible face for the public, but the façade was hard to keep going when
those tensions flared as they often did. Again from Newell and Avery’s
book, Mormon Enigma:

> The personal tension between Emma and Joseph may have eased toward the
> end of the summer when Emma seemed to have come temporarily to terms
> with plural marriage. Allen J. Stout, who served as Joseph’s
> bodyguard, testified in an 1885 meeting that with “only a single door
> separating him from the family, he listened to a conversation which
> took place between Joseph and Emma Smith, on the much vaunted subject
> of plural marriage. This impulsive woman,” Stout declared, “from
> moments of passionate denunciation would subside into tearful
> repentance and acknowledge that her violent opposition to that
> principle was instigated by the power of darkness; that Satan was
> doing his utmost to destroy her, etc. And Solemnly came the Prophet’s
> inspired warning ‘Yes, and he will accomplish your overthrow, if you
> do not heed my counsel’”

Notice the coercive language Jo was using to break Emma’s spine in these
interactions, while also fearing Emma when she would lash out in a fit
of rage and jealousy.

In 1887, William Law, at this time a dear friend of the Smiths, was
interviewed by The Daily Tribune out of Salt Lake City. His memory
serves to further contextualize the inner conflict Emma was working
through in accepting the practice of polygamy. He also reveals some
details of how she stood to gain from some of these marriages, which
certainly adds more dimension to her personality.

Emma was smart and powerful in Nauvoo, but she was also playing the hand
she was dealt. Willliam Law’s opinion of Emma is also very complex given
his own sordid history with Mormonism being the only surviving publisher
of the Nauvoo Expositor when this interview was conducted. But another
Q\&A from the interviewer reveals even more concerning details about
Emma and her conduct.

> “What do you remember about Emma’s relations to the revelation on
> celestial marriage?”
> 
> “Well, I told you that she used to complain to me about Joseph’s
> escapades whenever she met me on the street. She spoke repeatedly
> about that pretended revelation. She said once: “*The revelation says
> I must submit or be destroyed. Well, I guess I have to submit.*” On
> another day she said: “*Joe and I have settled our troubles on the

> Joseph’s crimes. She was a large, coarse woman, as deep a woman as
> there was, always full of schemes and smooth as oil. They were worthy
> of each other, she was not a particle better than he.”

The entire interview is full of precious little nuggets similar to this
that preserve a candid view of the belly of the beast from somebody who
was in the circle of elites and saw most of what went on. My overall
point is that Emma and her relationship to polygamy at this time is
incredibly complex. It can’t be summarized simply. She clearly stood to
gain from some of these relationships and in the case of the Lawrence
sister she did to the tune of $3-8000. She gained property as well. Some
of the arguments she and Jo had about polygamy were resolved with Jo
signing over land and building deeds to her, or buying her a nice coat.
But this material wealth she gained from polygamy came at a price. What
is material and monetary wealth good for when the community treats you
as an outsider? What good is lots of money if your friends only treat
you nicely because they fear your wrath? The overwhelming feelings of
jealousy created when you know your husband is in the house but isn’t in
his own bed many nights must have been absolutely crushing. The time and
effort expended on policing the conduct of young women in the house
tarnished the relationships Emma had with many of them. Beginning in
Kirtland Jo had a pattern of bedding Emma’s best friends, then she would
react, then they’d go away. Emma and Fanny Alger were close friends
until she discovered Fanny and Jo in the barn and Fanny was taken away
to Indiana. She was close friends with her secretary in Nauvoo, Eliza R.
Snow, but when Emma saw them a little too close an altercation ensued
and Eliza was forced to move out of the Nauvoo homestead and their
friendship was never repaired. Eliza and Emily Partridge were like
daughters to Emma, but they became bargaining chips between Emma and Jo
lest Emma violate the Law of Sarah.

So, yes, Emma opposed polygamy. She also approved of it. She couldn’t
stand watching the religion her and her husband had created devolve into
a sex ring, but she also became incredibly wealthy throughout it and the
bodies and trauma created in the warpath of Mormon expansionism was just
another line to mindlessly add to the “expenses” column. Emma also
served to be the moral devil’s advocate on the real-world results of
polygamy. For example, Emma had many issues with Jo’s personal scribe,
William Clayton. However, when she found out Clayton had impregnated his
polygamous wife, Emma told Clayton he should take the teenager into his
home to provide support for her and the coming child. In many ways, Emma
was the only advocate polygamous women had in Nauvoo that kept the
practices from completely breaking people. She had the ear of the
prophet, the patriarch, and nearly all of Jo’s closest acolytes who were
running the church. Her personal affect seemed to fluctuate with current
events. During this era of good-feeling in Nauvoo she was reported by
friends as being friendly, jovial, hospitable, and kind to most people.
When events turned for the worse, her health sickened and she became the
vengeful woman full of wrath because of the blatantly immoral conduct of
her husband and many other Nauvoo elites.

Emma was a great human being with plenty of flaws. She always stood to
gain from the church and always did, but she also suffered through every
trial and tribulation the church experienced. She left very few personal
writings that reveal what her true thoughts and intentions were. She
always lived behind a mask that was adaptable. But, more importantly,
she was often the morality check on her husband, which was the most
unenviable task in the entirety of Mormon history. How do we reconcile
the models of Emma that are floating around out there? We have the pious
and stoic Emma who was unflappable and faithful in everything she did.
We have the Emma who was grabbing up any land and wealth she could get
her hands on, just like every elite in Nauvoo was doing. We have the
Emma of William Law and Joseph Jackson who was just as devious and
immoral as her husband, Jo just helped direct her menacing mind to
whatever task they both could gain from. We have the Emma who was a
vicious and avowed opponent to polygamy her entire life juxtaposed to
the Emma that literally took the hands of teenage women and put them
into the hand of her husband while she bore witness to their marriages.
We have the Emma who was hospitable and kind, and the Emma who kicks
people out of her house because they showed too much affection towards
her husband. We have the Emma who was deeply in love with Jo, but when
she was in a truly inconsolable or angry state, Hyrum came to the rescue
and calmed her down. We have Emma who was bound to bed for weeks at a
time from illness, and the Emma who stayed by mother Lucy Mack Smith’s
bed for 5-days straight nursing Lucy to health before her own health
gave out and she collapsed. We have an Emma who was frequently
surrounded by legions of friends and personal women leadership in the
Relief Society, then we have Emma in 1843 becoming increasingly
reclusive and spending lots of time outside of Nauvoo on various
business trips, never really paying her friends much mind as she was
forced into isolation due to her circumstances and personal demeanor. We
have the Emma after Jo’s death, avowed and sworn enemy to Bloody Brigham
Young, and the Emma who raised Joseph III to become the most intelligent
and pragmatic prophet throughout the entire history of the tradition of
Mormonism.

These models of Emma needn’t be reconciled. To a degree they’re all
true. Emma simply doesn’t get enough credit for her role in early Mormon
history or for her incredibly quick wit. Here’s a few examples to prove
my point from Mormon Enigma, you’ll find a link in the show notes to buy
a copy of this book for yourself, it’s truly an incredible book.

And another:

Both the people we’ve discussed today, Jane and Emma, are so incredibly
fascinating. They both had their own stories, they had intentions and
unexpected outcomes when working towards those intentions. They were
both held back by society because of their birthright, both finding
themselves in situations with little control or ability to give true
consent or change their circumstances. Both were sealed to the prophet
only after assenting to the requirements of people they couldn’t
control. In Jane’s case, sealed as a slave by proxy to the Smiths,
agreeing only after it was the only sealing Bloody Brigham would allow
to be done in the temple for Jane. In Emma’s case, she was only sealed
and inducted into the holy order with her second anointing after she
agreed to Jo taking half a dozen wives living in her own home. Both of
these women were victims of a coercive system with eternal ramifications
they both sincerely believed in. Both were forced into systems they
didn’t agree with because they were obeying the laws of men who said
they were speaking for god. Both were conflicted. Both were complex and
unique human beings. Most importantly, both considered each other
family, sealed together through the new and everlasting covenant.
