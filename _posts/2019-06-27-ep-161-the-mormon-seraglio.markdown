Ep 161 – The Mormon Seraglio

On this episode, we jump back into Nauvoo Mormonism. We begin with
discussing the realm of politics in the 1840s. Jo’s political chess
didn’t begin in Nauvoo, but Nauvoo was where he ramped up his game and
moved to the ranks of political chess master. Jo had an incredible
ability to curry the favor of powerful politicians and influential
business owners who regarded Nauvoo as a tourist town on the
Mississippi. Then we discuss how polygamy and the practice of “spiritual
wifery” required a system of organization and ascendency for Nauvoo sex
workers. The results are worthy of note and degrading to the women who
were regarded as property.

We’re returning to our historical timeline after the last two episodes
with historian Chris Smith on the topic of Native-Mormon relations.
There’s always a challenge on this show, a balance I work to strike
every week. This is the serial Mormon history podcast, I try to deal
with issues chronologically, but, maybe some of you have noticed this,
for quite a bit of our Nauvoo episodes I’ve had to deal with issues
topically as they arise, which requires bouncing around the timeline a
little bit. No other topic in Nauvoo history requires a topical
treatment than Mormon politics, which is what we’ll be discussing today.

Politics of the 1840s were quite interesting. If we consider our
political sphere complex today, always keep in mind that it has always
been perceived as just as complex and chaotic to people who were living
at the time. Politics is up in our faces today with the 24-hour news
cycle and social media, but even in the absence of those tools, politics
has always been the dog-eat-dog kind of world we see today, just
operating further out of the view of the public eye.

There may be a case to be made that by percentage more people are aware
of and engaged in politics today than at any other time in American
history, but that has been largely as a result of the accessibility and
ubiquity of these social issues continually bombarding us right in the
face every waking moment. The availability of information has probably
shifted more people to focus on politics, but while the complexity and
games we see every day in politics has always been present, the public’s
knowledge of it hasn’t been.

When it came to the 1800s, the only people who were privy to what was
going on in politics were those who actively payed attention, there
wasn’t the level of political osmosis we experience today. Politics in
the 1800s was an elite’s game. Andrew Jackson was really the first
president to actually make his way from a populous platform appealing to
the every-day average Joe for votes. But Jackson’s presidency was over
in 1837 and his successor, Martin Van Buren, was back to the elites
being in control of the presidency. The Whigs made a comeback with
populist non-politician William Henry Harrison, the so-called hero of
Tippecanoe, one of many people who claimed to be the guy who killed
Tecumseh, but he died a month into his presidency and his VP, John
Tyler, was once again a member of the widely-reviled Washington elite to
take the throne of the presidency. The Whig party had been losing a lot
of power in the late 1830s and early 40s, Tyler’s inheriting the
presidency from Harrison marked one of the final death throes of the
Whig party as typically Whig voters became disenchanted by the party’s
lackluster performance.

An issue that does seem to divide 19<sup>th</sup>-century politics from
our current political sphere is the declaration of voters. What I mean
by that is today people typically designate themselves either Republican
or Democrat, and they use those labels to largely summarize their
personal perspective of common social issues. In the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, it was far more common for people to be issue-voters instead of
party-line voters. Americans would vote for an issue based on how it
impacted them directly, and much less out of loyalty to one of the two
political parties in power. This meant that political platforms from two
different politicians of the same party could be wildly different and
campaign pamphlets would often incorporate rhetoric and buzz words from
both parties; which would be like seeing Elizabeth Warren today running
on a pro-choice anti-abortion platform. It’s hard to understand through
our presentist lens, but suffice it to say, parties adapted with evolved
cultural mores, as opposed to political parties shaping cultural mores
as seems to be the case today.

Joseph Smith and the Mormons had an increasing involvement in politics
as Jo’s ministry matured. When Jo first declared himself a prophet of
god and published his Book of Mormon, there aren’t really any extant
political declaration from his early ministry. As the Mormon sect
continued to grow, he waxed political and his varied interests became
even more diverse. The first trouble the Mormons really ran into was in
Missouri when citizens of Jackson County sought to remove the Mormons to
counties north of Jackson. However, even at this time, Jo didn’t spend
much time working with politicians in Missouri to secure safety for his
parishioners. That duty fell to the Whitmers, William Wines Phelps,
Frederick G. Williams, and a few other Mormon elites. Jo stayed largely
disconnected from the issue, which was for the better, because when he
did get involved, he just marched 200 of his bros out there with their
guns and bowie knives that all ended in a dozen of them dying from
cholera.

After that, one of Jo’s early political movements was to get the
Kirtland Safety Society approved by the Ohio state legislature. He
wanted to form a bank to deal with tens of thousands of dollars of
outstanding debt. Jo sent Orson Hyde, or Orson L’Chydem as we call him
because of his later mission to the holy land, to the Ohio state
legislature to procure the bank’s charter. Hyde couldn’t get any
sponsors, so he returned to Kirtland to acquire signatures of
non-Mormons who could vouch for the formation of the Mormon bank. He
returned to the legislature and was able to gain a few sponsors for the
charter, which was incorporated into a larger spending bill to be passed
early that year, 1837, but the bill was defeated and the Kirtland Safety
Society wasn’t approved, making it illegal for the KSS to issue bank
notes. As a perfect analogy for Jo’s conduct moving forward, he simply
told his boys to change the printing plates to Anti-Bank-ing society and
print the money anyways. This foray into politics was wholly
unsuccessful, and Jo simply decided to circumvent the entire system when
he couldn’t bend Ohio laws and politics to his will.

For Jo’s first real foray into politics and the elite sphere surrounding
it, the theatre of our focus shifts to Missouri in 1838. Jo had so many
legal troubles in Ohio that he was forced to flee the state and take
refuge in the Mormon settlements in Caldwell and Davies counties. The
Mormons had always been perceived as an imposition by Missourians. Now
with their headquarters recently moved to Missouri, tensions rose. Jo
began active campaigns to get Mormons elected to government offices, he
frequently exchanged letters with members of the Missouri government,
including Governor Boggs himself, all while creating his own Mormon
theocracy in the shadows with its own military and underground
enforcement squad. After everything boiled over in Missouri and Jo found
himself among dozens of his fellow Mormon elites locked up in state
jails, the Mormons had to shift tactics when it came to politics. No
longer would they impose themselves upon the system, instead opting to
work within it to curry the favor they required to make a permanent
settlement.

This renewed earnest foray into politics with seeming good faith was
well-received by Illinois politicians, including John C. Wreck-it
Bennett, and Governor Thomas Carlin. Upon Jo’s escape from Liberty Jail,
he sought to build necessary relationships with people in power. Those
relationships were forged through a lot of work and help of Wreck-it
Bennett, but these new political movements also shaped Nauvoo society in
many ways, which we’ll attempt to explore in this episode.

At the heart of Jo’s actions lay the single motivation of self-interest,
which regularly manifested in him doing he perceived as best for the
Mormons. When it came to elections, Jo was only motivated to vote for
who could provide the Mormons with the most liberty. The Mormon voting
bloc was up for sale to any politician who would stroke the ego of, and
make the grandest promises to, the one true prophet. This also caused
some tensions in the membership who viewed Jo solely as their prophet
and religious leader. Jo had to strike a balance with these people that
his politics were done in service of forwarding the kingdom of God,
which could be a hard sell to the more skeptical of his followers.

Historian Timothy L. Wood published an article in the Journal of
Illinois State Historical Society back in 2000, vol. 93 no. 2, in which
he summarizes this tension very aptly.

> \[T\]he relationship between religious and secular authority during
> the early days of the Mormon movement was quite paradoxical. Although
> Mormonism came into being during a time of heightened democratic
> awareness in the United States, it quickly developed many
> authoritarian tendencies. According to \[Thoms F.\] O’Dea, as
> Mormonism developed a coherent church polity during the 1830s, a
> potentially unstable dichotomy emerged. On one side was the impulse
> toward congregationalism that so many of the New England Saints had
> been steeped in, which emphasized the authority and participation of
> the general membership. On the other hand, to avoid schism the church
> needed to contain religious charisma and innovation within the office
> of prophet-president. To maintain any kind of unity of purpose, Smith
> alone had to be seen as the sole source of direction for the
> Restoration movement.
> 
> The resulting system has been characterized as “a willingly designated
> absolutism.”

Further in the article, Wood cites Historian O’Dea again saying “What
had developed was a democracy of participation and an oligarchy of
decision making and command… Thus Mormon authoritarianism drew its
leaders from the ranks, and the ranks supported such leaders.”

Now from later in the same article:

> This principle suggests a paradox in the Mormon attitude concerning
> the relationship between religion and power. Within the church and the
> immediate community, Mormons tended to favor an authoritarian style of
> leadership, which enforced doctrinal conformity and defended such
> “peculiar” LDS social institutions as secret temple rituals and,
> eventually, polygamy. On the other hand, the constitutional theory
> articulated by Smith and his followers steadfastly advocated the
> principles of religious liberty and governmental noninterference with
> the religious lives of its citizens. Seen in that light, the Mormons
> demanded traits in their leaders at the state and national level that
> would have seemed quite distasteful to them if possessed by authority
> figures closer to home.

So, just like Mormons today, small government that allows religious
liberty, but if Mormons are controlling the government, then we’re
totally okay because that’s just one step to building Zion.

It wasn’t until Nauvoo where this described phenomenon really became the
status quo, although the roots trace back to the early Kirtland era.
It’s how the church operates today, although by a much more
streamlined algorithm. Power is vested in the highest echelon of members
who’re lifelong devotees, while the average membership sees their role
as crucial in the theodemocracy of voting to sustain leaders every
conference. To inspire loyalty, the leadership draws from the lower
ranks to fill middle management, which inspires every member to
eventually aspire to the higher echelons, even if that may never be a
remote possibility. This was how the church itself operated in Nauvoo,
and it was how politics in the city worked. Jo did his best to keep only
the most loyal followers close to him which were all pulled from the
lower and middle ranks, granted promotions upon expressions of fealty.
People like Wreck-it Bennett had to buy his way into the highest ranks
with offerings of nearly unlimited political power, a promise on which
he delivered. For his efforts, Wreck-it Bennett gained access to the
deepest and darkest secrets of the Nauvoo kingdom; he became bearer of
Jo’s most explosive secrets.

We’ll get back to Bennett in a minute, but let’s spend a second talking
about Nauvoo from an economic perspective for a moment. To understand
Nauvoo economics, a further contextual understanding of broader Illinois
economics is required.

From Robert Flanders’ Nauvoo Kingdom on the Mississippi p. 167

> General economic conditions in the state were at that time near a
> state of collapse. The whole country had remained depressed following
> 1839; and in Illinois the chronic fiscal crisis stemming from the
> enormous state debt incurred by the plan of works had further hindered
> recovery. Public and private credit had long been strained, and early
> in 1842 the Bank of Illinois at Shawneetown and the Illinois State
> Bank at Springfield failed. With the collapse of the two largest banks
> financial ruin spread throughout the state. What commerce there was
> was on a near barter basis.

This financial strain was hitting the Mormons and Jo hard by late 1843
where our historical timeline resides. Dozens of city projects had been
conceived, initially financed, and had yet to be completed to return on
the investment, or failed outright. Jo was personally hundreds of
thousands in debt for land contracts he’d signed to get the Mormons
their own land. He wasn’t paying bills on the land contracted for, so
the deed holders were unable to pay land taxes, making them more
insistent on Jo to repay even a small portion of his debts. The Canal
project was set to bring a ton of commerce and manufacturing into town,
but a few feet were dug and the project was abandoned. No factories were
built. The small amount of mercantile and goods the Mormons could
produce was too costly to ship to a location where they would sell for
the price the labor commanded. The Nauvoo Temple was an absolute black
hole of resources that would never produce income the way temples do for
the church today through membership fees of 10% of every member’s
income. The Nauvoo House was a project created to make the premier inn
and tavern in the state of Illinois, but it was so far behind schedule
that Jo opted to have a wing added to his own home for visitors of the
city to stay in. We could discuss many similar projects, but these
examples suffice to illustrate how problematic Nauvoo’s economy was.

But those were just the economic forces at play at the city-wide level.
Jo had mountains of personal notes he’d yet to square away. Another
passage from Flanders’ book offers a window into Jo’s own financial
troubles.

> That Halstead and Haines note was only one of many financial problems
> trying the Prophet just then. Smith was beginning his store business
> in the winter of 1841-42. He managed in March, 1842, to repay William
> Marks, the Nauvoo Stake President, “who had loaned money and property
> to the Church at various times.” Smith recorded with evident
> satisfaction, “Closed a settlement with William Marks… and paid him
> off, principal and interest to the last farthing for all that myself
> or the Church had had of him.” The following day he recorded simply,
> “Settled with Brother Niswanger.” But he was unable to retire his
> obligation to the estate of Oliver Granger. “Finally failed to effect
> anything,” he complained. “\[Gilbert\] Granger refused to give up the
> papers to me, which he had received of his father, although I
> presented him deeds, mortgages and paper to the amount of some
> thousands against his father, more than he had against the Church.” It
> was in March that Smith advised Edward Hunter to bring specie to
> Nauvoo and offered him the store; the Prophet’s financial condition
> was then critical. Yet he did not suspend his land-buying operations.
> On March 2 he offered a New York land speculator $100 an acre for
> twenty acres in the city not yet owned by the Church, “or to take an
> agency to sell the same,” and a month later he bought a farm for
> $1,150.

This was all in the lead-up time to Jo and a dozen other Mormon elites
all filing for bankruptcy later that year of 1842. Maybe Jo thought if
he vacuumed up enough property that he’d be able to incur enough debts
and file bankruptcy and then somehow the properties would end up his,
although there’s no possible way to put our minds in Jo’s skull to see
what he was really thinking or what his possible long-term plans were
for answering all these debts.

This is the crucial issue here, and I can’t stress this enough, Nauvoo
wasn’t exporting anything. It was so painfully insolvent that only
disaster loomed in the near future. Chicago is what it is today because
at this time it was growing at a sustainable rate. It had location on
one of the great lakes, allowing for importing and exporting by water,
which was the largest medium of transit at the time. It had just
completed a rail system through the city in the late 1830s and was
beginning to reap the benefits.

Thomas Ford, elected Governor of Illinois in 1842 during a heated
election made more intense by the presence of the Mormons, summarized
this period in his 1852 book, History of Illinois, from page 232.

> The great plenty of money brought here by the work on the canal and
> the railroads, set up a great many merchants all over the country in
> business; it increased the stocks of goods brought to be sold; created
> unnatural competition amongst the merchants to sell; who were forced
> to sell on a credit or not at all. The people were encouraged to buy
> on credit, and when their debts became due, for want of money to pay
> them, they gave their notes to the merchants with twelve per cent.
> Interest, which the reader will observe hereafter was the cause of
> some strange legislation on the collection of debts, and caused the
> reduction of the rate of interest to six per cent. Until the year
> 1833, there had been no legal limit to the rate of interest to be
> fixed by contract. But usury had been carried to such an unprecedented
> degree of extortion and oppression, as to cause the legislature to
> enact severe usury laws, by which all interest above twelve per cent.
> Was condemned. It had been no uncommon thing before this, to charge
> one hundred and one hundred and fifty per cent., and sometimes two and
> three hundred per cent. But the common rate of interest by contract
> had been about fifty per cent.

Understandably, Governor Ford’s brain would explode at payday lenders
today, but this sets the scene for what the wild west of speculation was
like. People were trading notes and bartering because actual gold and
silver specie was so hard to come by since the panic of 1837 and the
specie circular which required the government to only take gold and
silver for taxes. All of this crushing debt led to an interesting
program in 1842. Once again, from Flanders Kingdom on the Mississippi:

> On April 12 the Quorum of Twelve initiated a program of debt
> forgiveness within the Church. Many Saints had borrowed from their
> brethren over a period of years, and the Presidency and Bishopric had
> done likewise to relieve the destitute from the Missouri expulsion and
> to build up Nauvoo. “Many of these claims have already been settled,”
> said the Apostles, “many have been given up as cancelled by those who
> held them, and many would remain unsettled.” Now the Twelve urged a
> general cancellation of all such claims “which have arisen out of the
> difficulties and calamities of the Church… that when the Temple is
> completed, there will be nothing from this source to produce jars, and
> discords, strifes and animosities, so as to prevent the blessings of
> heaven descending upon us as a people… While things remains as they
> are, and men remain subject to the temptations of evil as they now
> are, the day of release, and year of jubilee cannot be…” How were the
> Saints to prosper when the Church, the Presidency, and bishops, and
> “those who have sacrificed everything but life… for our salvation,
> are thus encumbered? It cannot be.” They advised that all such “old
> accounts, notes, bonds, etc.” be consecrated to the Temple; if they
> could be negotiated, the proceeds would advance the building; if not,
> after the Temple was finished, “we will make a burnt-offering of them…
> which shall bind the brethren together in the bonds of eternal peace,
> and love, and union… and you shall rejoice… that \[you\] have
> hearkened unto counsel, and set our brethren free…”

A debt forgiveness program that would only seem to benefit the elite
who’d borrowed themselves so deep into a hole that even bankruptcy
couldn’t suffice to answer the cloud over their heads. Eventually, if
you’re so far in debt, it feels like a burnt-offering of all your debts
would be a good idea, but that’s not how economics work. This is the
micro level of individuals owing each other hundreds or thousands of
dollars, and the city itself was only a more extreme version of this
perpetual poverty being shrouded by the tangled line of credit web that
Nauvoo elites had weaved for themselves and the Mormons.

Nauvoo simply had no material exports and was importing goods at an
alarming rate, all on credit. Nauvoo’s chief export was debt. Loans and
creditors were swallowing the Kingdom on the Mississippi and there was
no answer beyond just holding out. Just hold out till we finish the
Nauvoo House, just hold out until a rich guy comes and builds a factory
here, just hold out a little longer; but the house was never built and
the rich men never came.

But that didn’t stop rich and powerful men from visiting the Mormon
theocracy. In fact, for all the troubles the Mormons were experiencing,
they could still put on a hell of a good show when a visiting dignitary
would make their way to the city. Annual fourth of July parades with the
Nauvoo Legion in full battle regalia, skirmishes, and grand parties
became a wildly popular event for wealthy people to attend.

The prophet was quite the entertainer. The number of house parties he
held in the Nauvoo Mansion and other public areas throughout 1841-44 are
truly remarkable, most of which were catered and attended to by his many
beautiful young wives. If Chicago was the industrious Mexico City,
Nauvoo was Cabo. The Mormon kingdom is where rich people in Illinois
went to party and rub elbows with other prominent politicians. Jo wasn’t
a politician, but he held a ton of political power with the Mormon
voting bloc and thus attracted a lot of powerful people. He also
installed the Masonic lodge just a year and a half prior to where our
timeline resides in late 1843, and plenty of politicians at the time
were Masons, making Nauvoo even more enticing for the beautiful 3-story
lodge they’d just built.

All of this amassing power all came back to the Nauvoo Charter and how
it was employed. As Flanders puts it in the Kingdom on the Mississippi:

> On its face it was just another city charter with some novel clauses;
> in operation it was a charter to create a Mormon kingdom in the
> sovereign state of Illinois. Smith conceived Nauvoo to be federated
> with Illinois somewhat as Illinois was federated with the United
> States, with strong legal and patriotic ties to be sure, but also with
> guaranteed immunities and rights of its own.

Given the expansive powers granted by the Nauvoo Charter, and the
expansive powers realized by the Mormons by 1843, we need to understand
the importance for the Nauvoo House. It was set to become the Mormon
Ritz. A 5-star hotel with dozens of rooms, staffed by Jo’s younger
beautiful wives to take proper care of the dignitaries who chose to stay
a night or two in the city.

All of this leads to a question, what do rich and powerful politicians,
an elite group of which Jo was steadily becoming a member, want to do
when they go on vacation to a beautiful city like Nauvoo with very
little to do when compared to a large metropolis like DC or New York?
Same thing as wealthy politicians today, party. Sure, I’m painting with
broad brushstrokes here, but it’s the 19<sup>th</sup> century and
wealthy white guys are gunna do what wealthy white guys are gunna do.

Nauvoo was considered a temperate city because one of the first things
Wreck-it Bennett did upon his arrival and the passage of the Nauvoo
charter was to outlaw any alcohol distribution inside city limits unless
for medical purposes or with the express written approval of the Mayor,
Vice Mayor, or an Alderman of the city. This resulted in alcohol being
strictly controlled in the city for the year and a half Bennett was
Mayor, but much like prohibition, alcohol consumption still happened. Jo
himself was frequently seen in Nauvoo public gatherings with other
powerful men quite smashed. If you’ll permit me a bit of a long reading
from one of the most overlooked and fun little books in Mormon history,
Hearts Made Glad by Lamar Petersen. This is beginning on page 166.

> Biographer Harry M. Beardsley met the question of the Prophet’s
> decorum with this rationalization in his *Joseph Smith and his Mormon

> 
> Beardsley continued his picturesque peroration some sixty pages later:
> “At Kirtland many of the new arrivals had been bitterly disappointed

> carriage by Porter Rockwell and an able-bodied assistant.

In summer of 1843, the Smiths and many of Jo’s wives moved into the
Nauvoo Mansion when the Nauvoo House was so far behind schedule and the
city needed a proper place to entertain visitors. In the Nauvoo Mansion,
Jo had installed a bar, which Pistol-Packin Porter Rockwell attended at
bartender after his escape from jail and arrival late that same year. Jo
was apparently very proud of the barroom in the Nauvoo Mansion and when
Emma confronted him about it, this is what Jo said:

> He reminded her that all taverns had their bars at which liquor was
> sold or dispensed—which was true at that day—and again urged that it
> was only for a time and was being done for Porter’s benefit,
> explaining that since porter had been compelled to leave his own home
> and had, in measure, been made a scapegoat for charges that had been
> made against the two of them, he felt obligated to help him.

No hunny, I swear, it’s all Port’s liquor even though it’s our house\!
Besides, people who stay in taverns expect to have their alcohol palate
satisfied, so it’s okay, I promise\! A similar justification was given
by Jo’s nephew, Joseph F. Smith, when he was prophet of the Brighamite
church at the Salt Lake City Hotel was opened in 1912, when he said “The
people who visit us want something to wet up with—and unless it is
provided for them they’ll go somewhere else.” Same justification as his
uncle about the Nauvoo Mansion bar.

What many people would call sin and vice, was and undertone that gripped
Nauvoo. But, it wasn’t just alcohol, because drinking is only one part
of partying that wealthy white guys liked to do in the 1800s, but could
be equally applied to nearly all societies for all times in all places.

We know that a number of brothels operated in the city of Nauvoo. The
largest of which was owned by Wreck-it Bennett, which was uprooted and
tossed into a ravine for unknown reasons in late 1841 or possibly early
1842. However, Jo’s younger brother, Crazy Willy Smith, was operating
his own little prostitution ring, or “spiritual wifery” ring as
historians would call it. He had a smaller brothel on the outskirts of
town. Consider the economic pressures that led to the formation of these
brothels. Nauvoo had no system of major exportation to bring money into
town. One of the only ways money came into Nauvoo was through tourism by
wealthy and powerful men who often held government positions. This meant
that men couldn’t provide for their families and many women, who at the

A fascinating article you’ll find in the show notes goes through the
economic dynamics of sex work in antebellum America, written by Anya
Jabour, titled Women’s Work and Sex Work in Nineteenth-Century America.
Here’s just a little bit from it.

This was the harsh economic reality of Nauvoo and the expected results
in creating a fragile edifice of a city built on speculation, debt, and
fraud. What this eventually created was a system of organization among
the sex-workers of Nauvoo, some of which were also likely taken as
plural wives to Jo and other Mormon elites. Bennett’s expose includes an
entire chapter on the sex work hierarchy that was created within the
confines of Mormon theology as much as out of economic necessity. This
begins on page 217 of History of the Saints; the chapter is titled the
Mormon Seraglio. And, of course, if you’re a subscriber on
patreon.com/nakedmormonism you get access to the audiobook version of
this book with my commentary. It was a long read, but it’s all there and
uploaded if you search for NaMo Book Club on the patreon page for the
show, a little as a buck an episode will grant you access to that wealth
of controversial Mormon history.

> The Mormon seraglio is very strictly and systematically organized. It
> forms a grand lodge, as it were, and is divided into three distinct
> order, or degrees. The first and lowest of these is styled the
> “Cyprian Saints;” the second, the “Chambered Sisters of Charity;”
> and the third and highest degree is called the “Cloistered Saints,” or
> “Consecratees of the Cloister”.

He breaks down these three degrees of Mormon sex workers, attributing
the organizational and initiatory aspects to the Relief Society. For the
first degree, the Cyprian Saints, a woman is picked out when rumors
circulate that she’s “lapsed from the straight path of virtue” after
which she is marked and brought in for a Relief Society {I}nquisition.
According to Bennett, “This body is solemnly organized in secret and
select council, and by its members, the poor, terrified female is
questioned and threatened, until she confesses the crime she has
committed, or perhaps, in her confusion and terror, accuses herself of
what she was never guilty of. She is immediately, by the council,
pronounced a Cyprian, and is excluded from any further connection with
the Relief Society.” After this inquisition, this prospective Cyprian is
cut off from contact with her friends in the Relief Society and “her
name and failing are stealthily promulgated among the *trustworthy*
members of the Church, at whose command she is, for licentious purposes,
forever after.”

This is how a woman goes from nice and wholesome in the Mormon community
of Nauvoo, to being a target when some unfounded rumor circulates about
her chastity. And, according to Bennett, it was common that “Many young
and beautiful females have thus been ruined eternally,”. This was the
first degree that began young and beautiful females on a path towards
full-on sex slavery in Nauvoo. The next degree sounds much worse as the
women seem to become not only victim, but completely shaped by their new
forced profession.

> “The Chambered Sisters of Charity”
> 
> This order comprises that class of females who indulge their sensual
> propensities, without restraint, whether married or single, by the

> 
> Whenever one of the “Saints,” (as the Mormons style themselves,) of

For what interesting purposes might Jo “monopolize” some of these much
more numerous Chambered Sisters of Charity? They’re at the service of
all the highest-ranking Mormon elites, all the way down to the lowliest
Elders of Israel, and I’d bet their services were provided to Gentiles
when the opportunity would arise. Finally, Wreck-it Bennett gets into
the third and final degree of the most favored sisters of the Relief
Society.

> “The Consecratees of the Cloister, Or Cloistered Saints”
> 
> This degree is composed of females, whether married or unmarried, who,
> by an express grant and gift of God, through his Prophet the Holy Joe,
> are set apart and consecrated to the use and benefit of particular

> Church, and participate in the holiness of their consecrated wives.

Consecrated to the church and the designs of Jo and the church, just
like the property of the Gentiles in Missouri. The analogy makes itself
and the results are understandably similar.

There were other logistical constraints beyond merely establishing this
grooming structure to grow the pool of possible wives and sex workers.
Further detail is illuminated by another scathing expose of Jo Smith and
the Mormons, by Joseph H. Jackson, who Jo sent on a mission to break
Pistol-Packin Port out of prison, but Jackson was unsuccessful. He spent
a bit of time in our timeline, but he saw enough of what happened in the
darkest alleys of Nauvoo to shed further light on this superstructure of
hedonism.

On page 12 of his expose, which you’ll find in the show notes, he
describes the scriptural justification for polygamy and how sealings
worked. Then he writes:

> Having an explanation of the doctrine, let us see the application. Joe

Jackson has more strong words for one of these Mothers in Israel, whom
he called Madam Durfee in that previous screed.

Women coercing younger women into sex work, yeah that’s a thorny issue
to deal with. Women coercing younger women into sex work at the
direction of a self-proclaimed prophet who stands to gain the younger
women as his own personal sex workers to carry out whatever he sees fit,
that’s even more troubling. These are the structural day-to-day workings
of the Nauvoo sex worker ring. What does it really look like?

Why must we rely on strictly antagonistic sources for this information?
Is it not trustworthy because there isn’t any faithful corroboration of
this information? Would we expect to find a faithful member recount any
of this when their life held in the balance? There’s also the legality
of this to consider because polygamy was illegal and Sexual Slander laws
were powerful and carried heavy penalties.

As John Dinger notes in his 2018 article, which is nominated for best
article of JWHA this year:

> One of the major problems encountered when studying the beginnings of
> Mormon polygamy is the lack of contemporaneous historical
> documentation. This is because of the secret nature of polygamy and
> the crime of polygamy… “Secrecy itself defined and delineated this

> ‘illegal’ bigamous marriages.”
> 
> Another reason for the lack of contemporaneous documents is the

> 
> Such lawsuits help explain the lack of detail in John C. Bennett’s
> *History of the Saints*, and William and Wilson Law’s *Nauvoo
> Expositor*. While these laws may have helped to protect polygamists,
> they challenge historians studying Nauvoo polygamy.

Because of this dearth of available documentation, antagonistic accounts
must be used to contextualize faithful to form a more wholistic picture
of Nauvoo polygamy. Every historian I’ve asked about Bennett’s claims of
the degrees of wives has been handwaved or considered Bennett just being
Bennett, but it holds explanatory power and forms a basis of
understanding the organizational structure necessary when dozens of
Mormon men, and possibly dozens of powerful and wealthy Gentile tourists
were passing around hundreds of women like a frat-party pocket pussy.

Accordingly, historians have to deal with accusations like this from
Bennett and Jackson, specifically when it comes to the women’s
complicity in the criminal empire of Nauvoo.

And, because of sexual slander laws, the names of these women are not
provided.

The casual visitor of Nauvoo ran into the same limitations historians do
today. This was a criminal empire and operations behind closed doors
were never recorded. The real Nauvoo existed in the shadows of the clean
streets, the cheery-faced merchants, the casual young man whittling with
his bowie knife on the street corner, the beautiful buildings erected in
typical industrious Mormon fashion. The real Nauvoo will forever remain
enigmatic to those of us who study it from nearly 2 centuries in the
future, but that historical blindness is by design of the people who ran
the city and the man who sat atop the criminal empire. If Mormons living
in Nauvoo for years had no idea of the true face of the city that
underlie the mask that covers it, how can we expect to see the face of
the demon now? I think Joseph Jackson is a terrible writer, but this
passage in his 1844 expose stands out as exceptional to describe exactly
what I’m trying to say which applies equally to contemporary visitors,
and historians of today, especially if they believe the pious prophet
apologist narrative of this vile degenerate of a human being.
