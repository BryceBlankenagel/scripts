Ep 162 – Walker v. Hoge; Political Chess

On this episode, we discuss the controversial election of 1843. Jo had
promised his vote, and by implication the Mormon voting bloc, to the
Whig candidate and well-respected lawyer, Cyrus Walker. However, the
Democrats held control of the state militia that represented a constant
threat to the safety of Joseph Smith and the Mormons. Governor Thomas
Ford pulled a dirty trick to get the Mormons to vote for the Democrat
candidate, Joseph Hoge; a grand scheme was carried out to flip-flop the
Mormon vote. When Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith received a prophecy, the
Lord had spoken, let all the world be silent. Back scratching and
political favors negotiated behind closed doors rule the day.

By 1843, Jo had had over 2-dozen run ins with the law that historians
can document. There’s at least one known court appearance that happened
in the 1820s, before the Book of Mormon was published, that historians
don’t know the details of as they seem to have been lost to history. It
wasn’t until the late Kirtland era that Jo ever had legal counsel for
court appearances, and that’s because Jo was poor and the idea of a
public defender wouldn’t be created for another half-century. It was
another 40 years after that when the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution
would be interpreted to include competent legal counsel for any capital
criminal case in Powell v. Alabama.

In Powell v. Alabama, a 1931 case, nine young men of color were accused
of raping two young white women. These young men came to be known as the
Scottsboro Boys. They didn’t have the resources to hire an attorney,
because they were young black men in the 1930s, and weren’t appointed
one by the judge. Instead, the Scottsboro Boys were represented by a
real estate agent and some old guy that hadn’t practiced law in like 20
years. All but one of them was sentenced to death. They appealed and the
Alabama Supreme Court upheld the ruling. They appealed again and it went
to the Supreme Court. The case was overruled and the conviction
overturned because A) there was no evidence it had occurred, and B) the
legal counsel wasn’t considered proper or competent which tainted the
outcome of the original hearing. In this decision, the Supreme Court
ruled that, under the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment, federal AND state
governments are required to appoint competent legal counsel to those who
are unable to afford it. This was narrow in that it only required
competent legal counsel to be appointed in capital crime cases, but
later cases in decades subsequent would continue to expand the ability
of defendants to acquire a public defender. In Gideon V. Wainwright, a
1963 decision that any lawyer worth their salt should be able to recite
by heart, the definition of competent legal counsel was expanded to all
legal matters. Justice Black authored the Supreme Court’s opinion
lamenting the fact that “Even the intelligent and educated layman has
small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with
crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether
the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of
evidence… He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the
proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces
the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his
innocence.”

The idea of a public defender long preexisted Gideon v. Wainwright in
1963. It was first conceived of by Clara Shortridge Foltz, California’s
first female attorney, when she wrote about it extensively in the 1890s
and presented on the subject at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The first
public defender’s office was officially opened in 1913 in Los Angeles. 7
years later, the ACLU was formed as a non-profit organization defending
people’s rights, often pro-bono. The sphere of law in the
mid-19<sup>th</sup> century was enormously less complex than it is
today. In Jo’s day, attorneys often roamed from town to town taking up
cases, camping out in the wilderness and whatnot kind of like
stonemasons in medieval Europe. The current governor of Illinois in our
historical timeline, Thomas Ford, was one of these roaming attorneys.
Abraham Lincoln was a roaming attorney. These roaming bands of attorneys
would go wherever work called them, but it was always a dice-roll when a
person would hire one of them. The American Bar Association wasn’t
created until 1878, so basically anybody could say “I’m a lawyer now”
and would hire out for cases. Law firms existed, but they were only
accessible to the wealthy. The right to legal counsel granted by the
Sixth amendment wasn’t a right, it was a luxury for the wealthy.

For the majority of Jo’s career in the Kirtland era of the church, he
was never wealthy enough to afford legal counsel or deemed the expense
unnecessary. During the 1838 Mormon war in Missouri, Jo’s offenses were
capital and he acquired legal counsel in Alexander Doniphan, one of the
few Missouri government officials and militia officers who was friendly
to the Mormons. Here Jo saw the power held by attorneys. Not only did Jo
escape total conviction, but Doniphan even negotiated the venue change
that created the window necessary for Jo and his buddies to escape from
state custody. During the Nauvoo era, Jo would keep himself on the right
side of the law by surrounding himself with powerful politicians, often
with extensive knowledge of the legal system, and court relationships
with important justices who could navigate the law in a way that favored
the Mormons. Judge Stephen A. Douglas, later presidential candidate
running against Abraham Lincoln, became very intimate with Jo and the
Mormon elite. Josiah Butterfield was an attorney by trade and had been a
member of the church since 1833. Butterfield was appointed as a
president of the Quorum of Seventy and represented Jo in multiple legal
cases.

Not only was Jo beginning to recognize the power held by attorneys, but
he was becoming quite attuned to the general power of the legal system
when handled delicately by expert hands. Jo’s greatest legal troubles
were beginning to catch up with him in 1843. He had multiple outstanding
warrants for his arrest in June from Governors of multiple states. He
was a fugitive from justice of the state of Missouri from all the old
Missouri-Mormon war charges of arson, robbery, and high treason. He was
accused of collusion with Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell in attempting
to assassinate former Governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs. He and Port
had both been arrested in late 1842, but were left with the Nauvoo
constable and weren’t to be found. Port fled to Pittsburgh while Jo
remained in hiding in Nauvoo and the surrounding Mormon cities for
months. Eventually Jo gave himself up for arrest by Wilson Law, then a
Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion and member of the Nauvoo City
Council. This is when Jo and his posse of some 100 dudes, a sour lot of
Danites and ruffians in general, made their way to Springfield,
Illinois, where Judge Pope honored the latest iteration of the writ of
Habeas Corpus and Jo was allowed to go free. Episode 136 is where you’ll
find all the details of this hearing where Josiah Butterfield
represented Jo.

Jo remained safe for a short while through the first half of 1843. Then,
as Jo was visiting some of Emma’s family in Dixon, Illinois, Sheriffs
Reynolds and Wilson, acting on warrants for arrest and extradition
issued by Governors Reynolds of Missouri and Ford of Illinois, arrested
Jo. Episode 144-7 go through the week Jo was arrested and all the legal
troubles created by this chaos. When Jo was first arrested, however,
he’d learned from his previous dozens of legal troubles and decided
that acquiring a powerful and well-known lawyer as soon as possible
would bode well for his long-term wellbeing. As soon as Jo was arrested,
he didn’t know what to expect. He thought, reasonably so, that he’d be
extradited to Missouri. He had no idea if his Danites would find him or
not, but he knew if he was taken over the state line into Missouri, his
life was over.

So, what did Jo do? Well, he sent a messenger to the nearest lawyer who
could accompany him while in the custody of Sheriffs Reynolds and
Wilson. Two lawyers were first petitioned to come help Jo, Edward
Southwick and Shepherd G. Patrick. They both had the door literally
slammed in their face by the sheriffs when they tried to meet with their
client. Jo had sent his scribe, William Clayton, on a steamer to Nauvoo
to tell Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith about Jo’s arrest so Hyrum could send
out the Danites, but another messenger was dispatched to find a man with
a large name in legal spheres and nearly 3 decades of the legal trade
under his belt and suspenders, Cyrus Walker. He’d been a law partner
with Josephus Hewitt and James Conkling after he’d served two terms in
the Kentucky legislature after he’d been an attorney there for about a
decade. This guy, Cyrus Walker, was one of those lawyers with a huge
name who’d gone through the revolving door of law and government a few
times when he was approached by a messenger on behalf of Joseph Smith.
When the messenger told Cyrus Walker who wanted to hire him and for what
purpose, Walker’s response was predictable, as he was currently
attempting to walk again through said political revolving door. Walker
was out electioneering for himself to become a member of the Illinois
state house of representatives. But, the messenger, Stephen Markham,
offered Walker something he couldn’t refuse, the Mormon voting bloc.

HoC Vogel edition 5:471

> Mr. Cyrus Walker, who was out electioneering to become the
> representative for Congress, told me that he could not find time to be
> my lawyer, unless I would promise him my vote. He being considered the
> greatest criminal lawyer in that part of Illinois, I determined to
> secure his aid, and promised him my vote. He afterwards went to
> Markham and joyfully said, “I am now sure of my election, as Joseph
> Smith has promised me his vote, and I am going to defend him.”

And he was\! Cyrus Walker knew that now he could stop electioneering for
himself and devote his attention to Jo’s legal affairs, which he would
for the rest of 1843, and he would still be elected. Walker was running
as the Whig candidate during the death throes of the Whig party. Walker,
along with everybody else, could feel the waning power of the Whig party
which made the future of the Whig party and any of its candidates rather
uncertain. However, any candidate who could curry the Mormon vote in
Illinois had their election made sure, regardless of party. The Mormons
didn’t vote as a party, they voted for whoever Jo told them to vote for.

Walker had been Jo’s legal counsel back in 1841 when Jo was briefly
arrested, but the case was quickly forgotten upon the issuance of a writ
of habeas corpus by the Nauvoo city government. Walker and Jo had forged
a bit of a professional relationship during that case and likely had
mutual respect for one another. When Jo offered the Mormon vote to
Walker, he had every reason to believe that taking this one case would
land him Illinois’ sixth district, which included the Mormon-controlled
Hancock County. The Democrats had taken the Mormon vote for the 1841
election which put Thomas Ford on the Governor’s seat for 1842. The Whig
candidate in that election, Joseph Duncan, swore he would revoke the
Nauvoo Charter and Thomas Ford won with the Mormon swing voting bloc.
Joseph Smith even named his favorite horse ‘Jo Duncan’ so that he could
literally whip his greatest political adversary when riding off to build
the kingdom of god. Unless there were any extenuating circumstances, in
early 1843 the Democrats essentially considered Hancock County and the
Mormon bloc to be the most crucial swing voting bloc in their district.
However, with Cyrus Walker, the most prominent Whig candidate,
representing Jo in a very public and exciting hearing that held the
prophet’s life in the balance, the Democrats likely would have
considered the Mormons to have swung towards the Whigs. Jo coming out
explicitly and telling the Mormons in public settings that Walker had
Jo’s vote was enough of a signal to the Democrats that they’d lost the
Mormon bloc.

But, Walker was amidst campaigning for his own election when he signed
on to defend Jo, and the Democrats were amidst their own campaigning
around Illinois. The Democrats nominated a guy named Joseph P. Hoge to
run against Cyrus Walker. Both were described in Gregg’s 1880 History of
Hancock County as follows from page 291:

> The two candidates were representative men of their respective
> parties, and personally popular. Mr. Walker was an old lawyer of
> distinction in the State, and regarded as the peer of the leading
> lawyers at the capital. Hoge was a younger and newer man, but was
> talented, energetic, and a good stump speaker. He had never been in
> any way identified with the Mormons, residing in a county remote from
> them in the district. Walker was supposed to be in good favor with
> them, and had once or twice acted as counsel for the Prophet.

A limitation of campaigning in 19<sup>th</sup> century America was the
vast distances of a state such as Illinois and the complete lack of
proper rail infrastructure to cover those distances. Campaigning was a
months’ long endeavor of riding no horseback from town to town, making
frequent appearances, holding rallies and speaking to voters, and, of
course, knocking on doors. Gregg summarizes how tough this was along
with a general assessment of the political landscape of Illinois at the
time.

> Soon after the nominations \[of Hoge and Walker\], the campaign of the
> district began with great vigor. To make a thorough canvass in so
> large a district, it required a great deal of time and a great amount
> of physical energy, it being necessary to address the people in at
> least three or four, and often eight to ten, places in a county.
> Irrespective of the Mormon vote, there was a decided Whig majority in
> the district, and the probabilities were strongly in favor of the
> success of the Whig candidate.

So, you’re Cyrus Walker. You’re well-known and highly respected as a
past politician and adept lawyer. You’re campaigning as the Whig
candidate in a Whig majority district in a Whig state with a Democrat
Governor. Whether or not you choose to defend Jo in this controversial
case will likely have an interesting and unpredictable effect on your
campaign. What it certainly did was make for a ton of publicity and that
publicity was achieved with less time on horseback electioneering,
holding rallies, eating terrible tavern food, and knocking on doors
asking for people’s votes. I’d take that deal if I were him. Riding for
hours a day on horseback, staying at taverns, talking to thousands of
strangers and making vacuous campaign promises? That, juxtaposed with
being one dude’s legal counsel who’d been your client before and getting
all the necessary publicity from it to make sure you get elected? Which
would you choose, especially in an already safe election like this one?

There were a few issues that divided candidates and therefore
distinguished voters apart from each other. Most notably, slavery,
annexation of Texas as well as slave laws in newly annexed territories,
American expansionism and the plight of the Native Americans, national
banks, and a few other smaller issues, but these were the big-ticket
items candidates incorporated in their platforms. But Walker now
incorporated a new issue into his platform when he took on Jo’s case;
Mormon rights, which was rather divisive as well.

When the posse of the sheriffs who’d arrested the prophet, Jo, along
with his newly acquired legal counsel, Cyrus Walker, a big group of
Danites all made it to Nauvoo, Walker made an incredible speech on
behalf of Jo and the expansive rights of the Nauvoo city government.
Once again from Gregg’s 1880 History of Hancock County:

> When Smith was arrested it so happened that both Walker and Hoge \[the
> Democrat candidate\] were in the vicinity of Dixon canvassing the
> district. In addition to the two Dixon attorneys, Smith sent for and
> engaged Walker. This gentleman left his appointments, and, as we have
> seen, rode with the cavalcade to Nauvoo, and, it is said, there made a
> three-hours speech in favor of Smith’s discharge by the Municipal
> Court, and contending for its jurisdiction.

But, not to be outdone by his political opponent only a month before the
election, the Democrat candidate, Joseph Hoge, also made Mormon rights
part of his campaign. Thus, we see just how Jo was able to realize and
throw around his political capital in this contested election. Hoge
travelled to Nauvoo and made a similar speech with regards to the
expansive power of the Nauvoo charter’s rights.

> Gov. Ford, in his history, states that both he \[Cyrus Walker\] and
> Hoge, from the public stand in Nauvoo, afterwards declared their
> belief in the existence of the power claimed by the \[Nauvoo
> municipal\] Court. \[meaning the powers of habeas corpus that Jo was
> attempting to exercise\]

Because Cyrus Walker had been so helpful to Jo in all these legal
troubles, Jo took the stand in early July of 1843, while the documents
were still being sorted in the wake of the arrests, hearings, and his
release. This is what Jo said from the pulpit while pointing to Cyrus
Walker who was seated on the stand from which Jo was preaching:

> I have converted this candidate for congress, that the right of habeas
> corpus is included in our charter. If he continues converted, I will
> vote for him.

This was the public declaration from the pulpit that Walker needed to
ensure that he had the Mormon voting bloc behind him in the coming
election the very next month. But the speech was far from over.

Jo continued the speech with a threat of violence, sending powerful
signals to the Mormons in the audience just as much as to Walker and any
other politician or reporter who may attending or receive a transcript
of the speech.

> There is nothing but what we have power over, except where restricted
> by the constitution of the United States… The constitution of the
> United States declares that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
> shall not be denied. Deny me the writ of habeas corpus, and I will
> fight with gun, sword, cannon, whirlwind, and thunder, until they are
> used up like the Kilkenny cats… And the great Elohim has given me the
> privilege of having the benefits of the constitution, and the writ of
> habeas corpus; and I am bold to ask for this privilege this day, and I
> ask, in the name of Jesus Christ, and all that is sacred, that I may
> have *your* lives and all *your* energies to carry out the freedom
> which is chartered to us.

Then he cast a vote to the audience with these words:

Will you all help me? If so, make it manifest by raising the right hand.

Then everybody shouted and cheered with uplifted hands in support of Jo
the Mormon Mahomet. As the crowd cheered, Jo turned toward Cyrus Walker
and spoke just loud enough for the recorder on the stand to hear, but to
escape the audience.

> These are the greatest dupes, as a body of people, that ever lived, or
> \[else\] I am not so big a rogue as I am reported to be.

When the crowd quieted down he gestured toward Walker and announced to
the crowd a statement that has become infamous in Mormon circles when
talking about Cyrus Walker and Joseph Smith’s involvement in law and
politics.

I understand the gospel and you do not,… You understand the quackery of
law, and I do not.

Hoge and Walker openly competing for Mormon rights turned the 1843
election into a race to the bottom of making expansive and unamerican
promises to the Mormon theocracy and its leader. Both Walker and Hoge
made their promises to uphold religious liberty in the face of Missouri
trying to extradite the prophet to finally hold him accountable for the
conflict there in 1838. But, Jo had made a promise to Cyrus Walker that
Walker would have his vote, implying that Walker and the Whigs would
have the entire Mormon bloc. Buuut, Jo made that promise when he was in
dire straits under arrest of two sheriffs with the proper documentation
to extradite him to Missouri and we know that Jo would make all sorts of
promises when his life was in danger, buuuuuuut when it came time to
uphold those promises, could he be counted on? So, how did this all play
out?

Cyrus Walker became the Whig liaison to the Mormons to ensure their
vote, but the Democrats held the state Governor’s office and Illinois
was slowly shifting from yellow Whig to blue Democrat as the Whig party
was dying a slow and painful death. Thomas Ford wasn’t necessarily a
friend of the Mormons, but throughout this fiasco of Jo’s June 1843
arrest Governor Thomas Ford simply let the issue die. He counted the
issue as handled. He’d done everything he planned on doing to get Jo
extradited to Missouri and it didn’t work, so the issue just fell away.
However, this meant that Ford and the Democrats seeking election in 1843
held leverage over the Mormons because the issue was still very volatile
in the minds of Illinois gentiles and anti-Mormons and it was a huge
issue for Missouri democrats who wanted Jo’s head on a pike. This August
1843 election was coming a mere month after the habeas corpus issue was
settled in the Nauvoo courts. The issue of whether or not Jo would be
forcefully taken to Missouri at the hands of an Illinois militia was
still vivid and unresolved in the minds of thousands of people, Jo
included. It was viewed by the public that the Democrats had been
responsible for Jo’s arrest and near extradition. Missouri was a deeply
blue-blooded Jacksonian Democratic state, seeing their neighbors in the
north, Illinois, as the hoity toity Whigs. Thomas Ford summarizes the
political state of affairs in his History of Illinois beginning on page
314.

> Upon this proceeding the whigs founded a hope of obtaining the future
> support of the Mormons. The democratic officers in Missouri and
> Illinois were instrumental in procuring his arrest. He was discharged
> this time by a whig judge; and his cause had been managed by whig

> in the next election.

The Mormons owed a political favor to Walker and the Whigs for Jo’s
escape from the gallows. Not only had Jo declared that he’d vote for
Walker in the next election, but the idea of Whig support had infected
the blood of the Mormon populous. The states of Illinois and Missouri
had Democrat governors to execute the laws and constitution of the land
and were therefore seen as solely responsible for carrying out the
criminal convictions of Joseph Smith. Walker, like many other
politicians, had found how he could be useful to the Mormons and
fulfilled that use. When the Nauvoo court released Jo from this June
1843 arrest, Sheriff Reynolds sought a meeting with Governor Thomas Ford
for militia support. Cyrus Walker was hot on his tail to attempt to
persuade Governor Ford the other direction. This is how Ford reports it:

> \[T\]he Missouri agent immediately applied to me for a militia force,
> to renew it; and Mr. Walker came to the seat of government, on the
> part of the Mormons, to resist the application. This was only a short
> time before the election. I was indisposed from the first to call out
> the militia, and informed Mr. Walker that my best opinion then was,
> that the militia would not be ordered; but as many important questions
> of law were involved in the decision, I declined then to pronounce a
> definite opinion.

After this meeting with the Governor, Cyrus Walker returned to Nauvoo to
report to Jo that Governor Ford probably wouldn’t be calling out the
militia. This meant that Walker’s use had been fulfilled to Jo and the
Mormons, but the looming threat of Jacksonian Democrats pursuing further
action by law still hung over Jo and the Mormons’ heads. What were Jo
and the Mormons to do? What were Illinois politicians to do with the
entire Mormon voting bloc up for grabs only a month from an important
election when the votes were already publicly sworn to Walker? Could Jo
and the Mormons be persuaded to change party fealty with a carrot and
stick approach?

This is what the Democrats did, once again, from Ford’s History of
Illinois:

> However, the democratic managers about Nauvoo, after the usual fashion
> of managing the Mormons by both parties, terrified them if they voted
> for the whig candidate, as they were yet determined, with the prospect
> of the militia being sent against them.
> 
> Backinstos, a managing democrat of Hancock county, was sent as a
> messenger to Springfield to ascertain positively what the governor
> would do if the Mormons voted the democratic ticket. I happened to be
> absent at St. Louis, but I heard some weeks after the election, that
> Backinstos went home pretending that he had the most ample assurances
> of favor to the Mormons, so long as they voted the democratic ticket.
> And I was informed by the man himself, a prominent democrat of
> Springfield,… that during my absence he had given a positive pledge,
> in my name, to Backinstos, that if the Mormons voted the democratic
> ticket, the militia should not be sent against them… Backinstos
> returned only a day or two before the election, and there was only a
> short time for the leaders to operate in.

Election day was two days away. Walker had been publicly declared from
the pulpit to be the Mormon horse in the race. Jo had sworn multiple
times in public that he would vote for the Whig candidate, Walker, but
now there was new information to deal with. Jacob Backenstos came to
Nauvoo and told Jo that he had it on good authority that the Democrats
wouldn’t call out the militia as long as they got the Mormon vote and
Backenstos has been given that information by somebody from Governor
Ford’s office. So, Walker had served his purpose. He’d held up his end
of the bargain and called off his electioneering campaign with the
handshake agreement that he’d get the Mormon voting bloc in a state with
a Democrat governor but largely run by Whigs in lower elected offices.
Now, the looming threat of the militia marching into Nauvoo, just like 5
years ago in Far West and Adam-Ondi-Ahmen, could be completely done away
with if Jo just got the Mormons to somehow vote Democrat. How would Jo
handle this without going back on his word with Cyrus Walker? How could
he do this while not admitting he was wrong and getting all the Mormons
to vote Democrat instead of Whig like he’d prepped them to do for a
month now?

The day Backinstos returned, August 6, 1843, two days before the
election, a public meeting was called in Nauvoo. Jo took the stand with
White-out Willard Richards recording what he said. This was recorded
quickly as Jo was speaking in realtime, so it doesn’t make much sense if
I read the original source document from the Joseph Smith Papers.
Instead I’ll read it from the History of the Church vol 5 where Willard
Richards expanded his notes from the source documentation into a full-on
sermon, adding and editorializing as he saw fit.

> I am above the kingdoms of the world, for I have no laws. I am not
> come to tell you to vote this way, that way, or the other. In relation
> to national matters, I want it to go abroad unto the whole world, that
> every man should stand on his own merits. The Lord has not given me a

> you promised him he could) I am going to give a testimony, but not for
> electioneering purposes: before Mr. Walker came to Nauvoo, rumor came
> up that he might become a candidate for Congress; (it wasn’t a rumor,
> you literally pulled him away from his campaign with your promise to
> vote for him) said I, he is an old friend, and I’ll vote for him. When
> he came to my house I voluntarily told him I should vote for him. When
> I made him acquainted with the ordinances of Nauvoo in relation to
> writs of habeas corpus, he acted in accordance therewith on my
> testimony. The rascals (\[sheriffs\] Reynolds and Wilson) took
> Walker’s and Montgomery’s security when I was arrested; Walker made
> Reynolds come to me and beg my pardon for the abuse he gave me; and
> through his means and influence the pistols were taken from the
> rascals. He withdrew all claim to your vote and influence, if it would
> be detrimental to your interest as a people.

And here it is, the important part of this pre-election sermon:

> Brother Hyrum tells me this morning that he has had a testimony to the

But the meeting wasn’t over just yet. After Jo stepped down from the
podium, Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff himself took the stand and expounded on the
revelation. No record survives of what he said specifically. After Hyrum
finished, William Law, one of the highest-ranking Nauvoo elites, took
the stand in an epic display of insubordination that foreshadows events
lying on our distant historical horizon. Back to Thomas Ford’s History
of Illinois:

> William Law, another great leader of the Mormons, next appeared, and
> denied that the Lord had made any such revelation. He stated that, to
> his certain knowledge, the prophet Joseph was in favor of Mr. Walker,
> and that the prophet was more likely to know the mind of the Lord on
> the subject than the patriarch.

Hyrum took the stand again to respond to what William Law had just said
about Jo being in favor of Cyrus Walker and “repeated his revelation
with greater tone of authority.”

Then Jo took the stand again to clear the air.

Now from Gregg’s History of Hancock County:

455 votes. The fact that Cyrus Walker put his electioneering campaign on
hold to defend Jo against his capital offense criminal allegations and
therefore wasn’t able to campaign effectively didn’t escape him or the
Whig party as a whole. Had Walker turned down Jo’s request to be his
legal counsel, Walker could have continued his campaign and secured the
election in the Whig state of Illinois and never would have lost by less
than 500 votes. Gregg comments on this lost opportunity for Walker and
the Whigs as follows:

> To Mr. Walker and his friends, and the Whig party generally, this

That is absolutely true. If the Mormons had simply abstained from the
election, Walker would have taken the win by a huge margin. Instead,
because Walker put his campaign on hold and this little flip flop Jo and
friends did, Hoge, the Democrat without a snowball’s chance in hell,
took the election in a major swing vote victory. If Walker had continued
electioneering for the rest of July and early August 1843, he could have
rallied up the Whig voters and gotten them to the polls and won even if
the Mormons had voted Democrat. The Mormons were a massive swing vote,
but Hancock was a solid Whig county. This was a dirty trick for Jo and
Hyrum to play, but at least it worked for a whole 9 months until Jo and
Hyrum were assassinated.

Thomas Ford opines on how the Whig politicians and papers had softened
their vitriol against the Mormons in 1843 in hopes of getting their
vote, but renewed their media assassinations of Jo and the Mormons once
they realized exactly what had happened.

This renewed fervor against the Mormons ignited a media firestorm the
Mormons would deal with for the remainder of their time in the state of
Illinois. All the way back in episode 77 we talked about a guy named
Thomas Coke Sharp. He’s gone absent from our historical timeline for
quite a while now, but it’s important to bring him up now. Sharp was one
of the founding members of the anti-Mormon political party in early
1840. Sharp attended the groundbreaking and cornerstone laying ceremony
of the Nauvoo Temple, Talos’ Temple Crown, when the Nauvoo Legion was
out in full force. Sharp noticed a major issue when one religious leader
had so much power and took to printing frequently about the Mormons in
his paper, the Warsaw Signal. Thomas Sharp earned the hated nickname
from Jo’s younger brother of ThomASS Sharp in Crazy Willey’s paper
called the Wasp. This guy was a thorn in the side of the Mormons and he
gave voice to the anti-Mormon political party that was ready to declare
all-out war against the chosen people of god.

Sharp’s Warsaw Signal articles were frequently reprinted in the Quincy
Whig and many other newspapers across the country, which fed into the
Mormon persecution narrative. But, consider the political sphere of 1843
and this hotly contested election. The anti-Mormon political party still
existed, but it fell into the background beginning in early 1843 because
the Mormon voting bloc was up for grabs by either party that year. This
meant that the Whig papers, as Thomas Ford spoke to from the previous
quote, were much less harsh on the Mormons. The Whig papers didn’t want
the Mormons to see the Whigs as their enemies if it meant they could get
the Mormon vote.

Similarly, the Democrat media was rarely anti-Mormon because there were
a lot of Whig Mormons, but they’d vote Democrat if Jo thought it would
be best for the church. The Democrats didn’t want to be seen as
anti-Mormon for the same reason the Whigs didn’t; it could cost them
crucial votes in this controversial 1843 election.

Now, however, all those barriers fell away. The Mormons declared their
fealty through a complicated mess of political chess and the Whigs were
ready for war. The Democrats had landed the Mormons for this 1843
election, but the hold was tenuous at best; the Mormons could flip back
to Whig at any moment. The Democrats were perceived by the Mormons to be
the party that had chased them out of the deeply blue Democrat state of
Missouri. The Democrats had to give the Mormons all sorts of favors to
retain those votes after this heated election, and the next presidential
election was just a year in the horizon. However, Jo did something that
nobody could have predicted, whether they were democrat or Whig. He ran
for president.

But where did Thomas C. Sharp go for 1843? We’ve read a number of his
articles from the Warsaw Signal on this show since episode 77, but he’s
been absent for a long time. Well, it turns out in late 1842 the Warsaw
Signal came into financial difficulties. October 1, 1842 was the last
issue of the Warsaw Signal owned by Sharp and on page two he wrote an
obituary for the paper. But, the Warsaw Signal was resurrected February
14<sup>th</sup>, 1844, with renewed volcanic editorials about the latest
Mormon movements in light of Jo’s declaration. The first resurrected
issue of the Warsaw Signal is amazing.

The following issue of Feb 21, 1844 is such a delight. And, trust me,
Thomas Sharp and his articles in the Warsaw Signal will continue to
occupy an increasing amount of our time moving forward.

Joseph Smith was a man supposedly led by god. He put himself in a
position of moral superiority of everybody else on the planet. I get the
line that he was a prophet but he was still a man and therefore not
infallible. Great, that’s fine, but he was also criminally venal and
nakedly unscrupulous in everything he did; the position he currently
occupies in our timeline is exactly what he was chasing his entire life.
Whether it was religiously, politically, socially, any other angle we
look at this guy, he did what he wanted in life and 1844 is the
culmination of exactly what he aspired his ENTIRE life. Jo had was
nearing the edge of absolute power and he was absolutely corrupt.
