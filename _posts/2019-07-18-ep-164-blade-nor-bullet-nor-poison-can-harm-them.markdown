Ep 164 – Blade, Nor Bullet, Nor Poison Can Harm Them

On this episode, we start with discussing whether or not Emma Smith
poisoned Joseph Smith. If she didn’t, who did? If it wasn’t poison, what
could it have been? Is there enough evidence to conclude that Emma
attempted to kill her first husband? After that we discuss the Christmas
party of 1843 at the Nauvoo Mansion when a drunk, Missouri-lookin’ guy
comes in and crashes the party. Joseph Smith gives a revelation that
came true: “I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that you—Orrin Porter
Rockwell—so long as ye shall remain loyal and true to thy faith, need
fear no enemy. Cut not thy hair and no bullet or blade can harm thee\!”

Preroll:

“I have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of
fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with
that unflinching courage, zeal, and patience, which she has ever done;
for I know that which she has had to endure—she has been tossed upon the
ocean of uncertainty—she has breasted the storms of persecution, and
buffeted the rage of men and devils, which would have born down almost
any other woman.”

\-Lucy Mack Smith

He carried the day, but I had to stay at home, as my father had been
warned by the Prophet to keep his daughter away from there, because of
the blacklegs and certain ones of questionable character who attended
there. His wife Emma had become the ruling spirit, and money had become
her God.

\-Helen Mar Kimball

Main:

The most well-regarded biography of Emma Hale Smith that exists to date
is Mormon Engima, written by Valeen Avery and Linda Newell. When this
book came out in 1984, it turned the realm of Mormon history concerning
Emma Smith on its head. Never before had scholars so unabashedly dealt
with Emma’s perspective of church history, and never had it been
conducted by women prior to this book. This was the 1980s and the field
of Mormon history. Women were just beginning to gain a legitimate
foothold in the field and being recognized for their contributions
beyond just mere tokenism.

The reason I bring this book up is for the title. Mormon Enigma, Emma
Hale Smith. It’s simply perfect. Emma is an enigma in the historical
sense. Her first husband, Joseph Smith, is a phenomenon, but he’s
anything but enigmatic. He’s hard to understand and nail down, but the
documentation that exists about him is so extensive that multiple
biographies have been written, all with slightly differing perspectives,
to create a fairly wholistic perspective of the guy. Emma, on the other
hand, much more is left to mystery and speculation. What historians have
about Emma is a few dozen letters to and from loved ones or prominent
figures, and plenty of second-hand descriptions from those close to her.
Unfortunately, Emma never kept a journal as far as historians are aware.
Her scribe, Eliza R. Snow, had disagreements with Emma concerning the
practice of polygamy and therefore never provided scribal duties to Emma
the way William Clayton or White-out Willard Richards did for Jo.

Somebody as enigmatic as Emma can be molded to fit many differing
historical models. Was she the stonefaced pillar of support for Jo as
many claimed her to be? Or was she prone to flying off the handle in
extreme situations? Was she kind, loving, and praiseworthy, or was she
cold-hearted, shrew and reclusive? Was her marriage to the prophet all
sunshine and roses, or did they fight like rapid chimps even including
physical abuse? Did she fully participate in all the ordinances of the
church at her own behest, or was she cajoled into them by Jo when he
used them as bargaining chips to get more wives? Did Emma try to kill
Joseph Smith?

Due to the simple lack of documentary evidence, quotes can be mined all
day to create a version of Emma that fits into each of these molds. What
complicates matters further when trying to identify the historical Emma
is the way she was slandered and perceived by the Salt Lake church
during and after her life following the schism crisis. Emma and Joseph
III represented the single greatest threat to Bloody Brigham Young’s
claims to prophetic succession. He acted as on would expect somebody who
had everything to lose would act and the propaganda campaign that
destroyed her character persists in Mormon culture to this day.

Needless to say, as a result of all these factors, a lot of lore has
grown around Emma, much of it based on contemporary sources, yet
exaggerated, amplified, and sometimes even fabricated. With this in
mind, we’re going to attempt to discuss the supposed poisoning incident.
In 1866, Bloody Brigham Young said this from the pulpit:

> The sympathies of the Latter-day Saints are with the family of the
> martyred prophet. I never saw a day in the world that I would not
> almost worship that woman, Emma Smith, if she would be a saint instead
> of being a devil. I feel so today. There is no good thing in a
> temporal point of view that I would withhold from her; anything that
> is in my power to do for her, I would willingly do with all my heart,
> and with an open hand.
> 
> There are a few here that knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and some of
> them are apostatizing from the work, which the Lord commanded him to
> found, to run after Young Joseph Smith, the second son of the Prophet,
> who has no more authority to set himself up as a president and teacher
> of a people than any other man has in the sectarian world who
> possessed nothing of the priesthood of the Most High. Young Joseph
> Smith does not possess one particle of this priesthood. The Twelve
> Apostles and the other authorities of this Church would have been
> exceeding glad if the Prophet's family had come with us when we left
> Nauvoo for the valleys of these mountains. We would have made cradles
> for them if they had required them, and would have fed them on milk
> and honey. Emma is naturally a very smart woman; she is subtle and
> ingenious, and she has made all her children believe that myself,
> brother Kimball, and the other members of the Twelve laid the plot
> which terminated in the death of the Prophet. This charge is
> especially laid to myself. At the time that Joseph was killed I was in
> the city of Boston, a number of hundred miles away from the scene of
> the martyrdom. She has made her children inherit lies. To my certain
> knowledge Emma Smith is one of the damdest liars I know of on this
> earth; yet there is no good thing I would refuse to do for her, if she
> would only be a righteous woman; but she will continue in her
> wickedness.
> 
> Not six months before the death of Joseph, he called his wife Emma
> into a secret council, and there he told her the truth, and called
> upon her to deny it if she could. He told her that the judgments of
> God would come upon her forthwith if she did not repent. He told her
> of the time she undertook to poison him, and he told her that she was
> a child of hell, and literally the most wicked woman on this earth,
> that there was not one more wicked than she. He told her where she got
> the poison, and how she put it in a cup of coffee; said he, "You got
> that poison so and so, and I drank it, but you could not kill me."
> When it entered his stomach he went to the door and threw it off. He
> spoke to her in that council in a very severe manner, and she never
> said one word in reply. I have witnesses of this scene all around, who
> can testify that I am now telling the truth. Twice she undertook to
> kill him…
> 
> JOSEPH HIMSELF TESTIFIED BEFORE HIGH HEAVEN MORE THAN ONCE THAT SHE
> HAD ADMINISTERED POISON TO HIM. THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN PRESENT TODAY
> WHO CAN BEAR WITNESS that more hell was never wrapped up in any human
> being than there is in her. She gave him too heavy a dose and he
> vomited it up and was saved by faith.

Consider the context in which this sermon was given by Bloody Brigham
Young. The dude was always jealous and outspoken about his tenuous
claims to the mantle of prophet. This was given in 1866, barely half a
decade after Joseph III took the mantle of prophet of the Reorganized
church. Alexander Smith, Emma’s second to youngest son, had just visited
the Utah territory to bring people from the Brighamite church into the
RLDS. Jo 3.0 may have been prophet, but Emma had a heavy hand in
everything that happened in the church. She was the matriarch of the
religion and was treated with respect and reverence by the RLDS folk,
which meant she was treated with vitriol and vilification by Bloody
Brigham.

So that’s the accusation from 22 years after Jo was assassinated, but is
there any contemporary source for Emma poisoning Joseph? Sort of, but
it’s not clear cut. Jo’s journal from 5 Nov 1843 reads as follows, and
we’ll parse out some possible interpretations after reading it.

Could this have been a poisoning? It’s plausible, but not very probable.
Let’s discuss why. This discussion is about to go a bit morbid for the
next few minutes so please bear with me.

First, was there anybody close to Jo during that dinner who may have
wanted him dead? Yes, absolutely. Jo had a lot of enemies in late 1843
Nauvoo, including Emma to some extent. It’s not really a matter of if
somebody had motive, but who of many possible suspects was it that had
access to his food or coffee without his notice. Emma had plenty of
motive to get rid of her husband with everything she was dealing with.
Her feelings toward Jo had shifted by mid-1842. She’d threatened divorce
multiple times and Jo considered the threat to have merit. She had
enough of Jo’s property in her name that she was going to be fine
financially if he was removed so there’s really nothing that could have
held her back from dosing him aside from love, but love can be a
double-edged sword in these matters.

A conversation about somebody poisoning Jo isn’t complete without
enumerating a few more possible suspects. The Laws were on their way
from stalwart faithful members to hated enemies of the church at this
time. Joseph H. Jackson could have tried it but he strikes me as too
dumb to pull it off. The Higbee brothers, who later became copublishers
of the Nauvoo Expositor, suspected at this time that Jo had their father
poisoned, and Jo had just preached that funeral sermon only a month
prior to November 1843, so the timing matches up. John C. Wreck-it
Bennett certainly wanted Jo dead, but he didn’t have access to Jo’s food
or drink at this time because he was mostly living in Missouri by late
1843. Sidney Rigdon certainly wanted Jo gone long before late 1843, but
he doesn’t strike me as somebody who would be so subversive as poisoning
Jo, in spite of his warlike sermons during the Mormon war in Missouri 5
years prior. However, Rigdon had a fairly solid claim to the throne once
Jo died, so that’s plenty motive in and of itself. Another half dozen
other people had gone mysteriously missing or died under unexpected
circumstances in Nauvoo and they all had families, some of which
certainly suspected foul play and wanted to retaliate. Add in to this
the entire line of people who had some level of rightful claim to the
throne beyond Rigdon and the list of people who wanted Jo dead is nearly
as long as a rap sheet of his crimes. Hell, Bloody Brigham himself is
just as likely a suspect for poisoning as Emma.

The motive and suspects are there for this to be a poisoning, what about
the substance and symptoms? The most likely potential substances are
strychnine, cyanide, arsenic, or atropine. Each of these individually
propose possibilities. Strychnine was often mixed with hard liquor and
sold to Natives as firewater. However, the symptoms don’t match because
strychnine causes seizure-like symptoms with spasms, back arching,
appendage rigidity, paranoia, stuff like that. However, it can cause a
person’s jaw to lock up, which Jo may have misconstrued as his jaw
dislocating, so that sort of fits. But a dosage that would affect him so
quickly also would have sent him into a coma in half an hour which
doesn’t fit with him going to the prayer meeting that same evening.

What about cyanide? Cyanide is actually a better candidate. The onset is
immediate and symptoms include violent vomiting, possibly even to the
point of fresh blood as Jo’s journal states, but the other symptoms
don’t seem to be there. He didn’t say anything about feeling otherwise
ill with symptoms that might lead to cyanide poisoning like chest pain,
abdominal pain, paranoia and anxiety, skin rashes, etc.

What about arsenic? Arsenic has been widely used as a poison since
before the fall of the western Roman empire. In white powder form,
arsenic is often referred to as “inheritance powder” because of its
frequent use to remove powerful people from their positions of power
without any trace. Onset takes 30 minutes, which fits with the timeline
from when Jo ingested the candidate to when he was vomiting fresh blood.
Headaches, confusion, diarrhea, excess saliva and sweating, convulsions,
stomach cramps and vomiting are all symptoms of arsenic poisoning,
usually sending the target into convulsive shock and then coma before
death. Basically, Joffrey Lannister without the bleeding eyes. If Jo had
been hit with enough arsenic to cause him to vomit blood, he wouldn’t be
going to prayer meeting that evening.

What about the final candidate, atropine? Atropine is distilled from the
nightshade family. The berries of belladonna are juiced and crystallized
which makes it water-soluble without any scent or trace. Belladonna was
widely used as a medicine in herbal medical books of the day. Here’s
Jacob Bigelow’s section on it from his 1822 Materia Medica published in
Boston:

> The Atropa Belladonna has bell-shaped flowers of a brownish or dusky
> colour, yellow at base on the inside. The berries are of a dark purple
> colour. The leaves have a nauseous subacrid taste, without smell… A
> peculiar akali has been announced by M. Brandes, as existing in this
> plant, and which he calls *atropia*. It is white, shining,
> crystallizable in needles, insipid, little soluble in water or
> alcohol, and capable of neutralizing a considerable quantity of acid
> to form salts. It is highly powerful, and even its vapour is
> injurious. The whole of the plant is poisonous, producing, in large
> doses, intoxication, attended with thirst, nausea, insensibility of
> the retina, causing a dilated pupil, constriction of the throat, coma
> or delirium, convulsions, and the other dangerous symptoms of
> narcotics. In fatal cases the stomach and bowels are found inflamed
> and gangrenous, and the whole body becomes swollen and highly
> purtrescent.

Belladonna was widely-known to be a deliriant and poison of the day, as
were its cousin plants like datura and potatoes. It was common knowledge
that the nightshade family of plants, which includes nearly 3,000
species, contain nasty stuff that can get you really high or kill you.
Bigelow’s Materia Medica even says to dose carefully beginning with “the
commencing *dose* is a grain, to be gradually increased till its effect
on the stomach and head becomes perceptible, by nausea and vertigo.” Jo
vomiting his guts up fits with atropine poisoning, but he didn’t mention
anything of vertigo or delirium, although I would postulate he was quite
well-acquainted with these effects long before 1843 and would have known
how to deal with them, probably not finding them notable enough to
include in his journal entry for that day, especially if he was headed
to prayer circle that night where other deleterious substances may have
been present. Still, enough atropine to cause an immediate fit of
vomiting likely would have sent him to bed with visions of angels
dancing on pinheads for the night, which didn’t happen so it’s not a
perfect fit. Besides, anybody with a passing knowledge of botanical
medicine, of which there were plenty in leading roles in Nauvoo
Mormonism, had the expertise to distill and crystallize the stuff.

My point is, there were plenty of candidate poisons Jo could have been
hit with. There were also plenty of people who wanted him dead, both
enemies and perceived friends who actually had access to his food or
coffee. All three criteria of means, motive, and opportunity are present
for this to be a poisoning with intent to kill. It’s completely and
totally plausible.

Now the question is, how probable is it that Jo was poisoned, whether by
Emma or any of the other dozens of people who wanted him dead? The
probability increases with each and every person added to the list that
wanted him dead and had access to him. Remember, we’re only 6 months out
from when he was actually assassinated. Judging the probability simply
requires introducing other plausible conclusions.

Now that my search history has the NSA following me, right Kerry? What
about other less salacious explanations? Well, food poisoning is one.
Food thermometers weren’t really a thing and undercooked pork or chicken
was a common affliction in 19<sup>th</sup>-century America. This easily
could have caused the immediate bout after eating. He may have even had
some undercooked bacon for breakfast and it hit him during this lunch
when he thought he was poisoned. Violent vomiting along with diarrhea
sure fit the entry in his journal and once he got it out of his system,
he could have been well enough to attend prayer meeting that night.

What about a medical explanation? Turns out that Jo was under a lot of
stress at this time in his life and also had a lot of partners he was
physically active with. The bacterium that causes peptic ulcers can be
transferred orally through a loving kiss shared by one of his dozens of
wives and the stress of running a church, a city, guarding against
assassins from within and without high church ranks, wanted by two
states, among many other pressures could have lowered his immune
system’s resilience. He gets an ulcer from all of it, then pukes up
blood after eating some spicy food.

Myriad explanations have been explored to remove any probability of Emma
actually poisoning Jo. Linda King Newell, one of the authors of Mormon
Enigma, wrote a Dialogue article in 1989 titled “The Emma Smith Lore
Reconsidered,” in which she attempts to dispel some myths that have
grown around Emma as a result of the anti-Emma anti-RLDS propaganda from
the Brighamite church. Here’s Newell’s take on the situation:

> Joseph would subsequently experience periodic bouts of sudden nausea
> and vomiting. Many ailments could cause such symptoms, including acute
> indigestion, food poisoning, ulcers, gallstones, but only poisoning,
> bleeding ulcers, or (rarely) food poisoning would have led to such an
> acute episode. Moreover, the 1844 poisons strong enough to cause
> hemorrhaging in the stomach as rapidly after ingestion as Joseph's
> diary indicates, would not leave the victim well enough to attend a
> meeting just a few hours later. According to Joseph's diary, "domestic
> concerns" kept him busy the next morning.26 Perhaps Emma was able to
> convince her husband that she had not attempted to poison him. The
> previous evening, according to Brigham, Emma had cried when Joseph
> lashed out at her. Tears rather than an open defense are in keeping
> with at least one other occasion when she endured a public rebuke from
> Joseph. When Joseph was suffering from violent vomiting the next
> month, he reported that Emma "waited on me, assisted by my scribe,
> Willard Richards, and his brother Levi, who administered some herbs
> and mild drinks. I was never prostrated so low, in so short a time,
> before; by evening was considerably better."

Valeen Avery, the other author of Mormon Enigma also interviewed two
physicians at the time they were writing Mormon Enigma who said they
couldn’t diagnose a patient who’s been dead for 140 years but that Jo’s
symptoms are most consistent with ulcers “considering Joseph’s stress
during this period.”

Did Emma try to poison Joseph Smith? We can’t know for sure. Some of his
symptoms are consistent with poison, but can be better explained
medically without the need for poison. But is the fact of whether or not
he was actually poisoned by Emma what really matters here? Does it
actually matter if Emma really put the inheritance powder in his coffee?
At face value these seem like big questions, but I think there’s a more
important discussion at the root of this conversation.

It may be helpful to reframe the question. What set of circumstances
would have led to Joseph Smith suspecting his own beloved first wife to
have poisoned him? The loving Emma, who’s been by his side through thick
and thin for nearly 17 years by this point, trying to kill her husband?
I don’t think any rational person could conclude that Emma was happy in
her marriage by late 1843. If that was the case, what was her exit
strategy?

The truth is, Emma, and every other woman in antebellum America, didn’t
have much control over their own lives. If they found themselves in a
situation that made them miserable, there wasn’t much they could do
without serious and unpleasant consequences. Being a divorced mother in
America today holds a stigma and society has come a long way since the
1840s. During this Nauvoo period, a woman couldn’t legally sign
contracts. She could be gainfully employed, but women made so little
compared to men that it was hard to provide for children. Legally
speaking, divorce put the children into the custody of the husband.
Children always had to have a male guardian. If Emma divorced Jo, that
would mean her children, Julia (13), Joseph III (11), Frederick G
Williams (8), and Alexander (5), would all be given to Jo by the state.
Not only did Emma want out of the situation herself, but she wanted her
children safe from the criminal kingpin. If she filed for divorce, that
would take away any legal ability she might have give them a better
life. Divorce was out of the question, even though she threatened it
multiple times.

Another option she had would be to run away. But Jo had friends who
would bring her and the kids back, they wouldn’t get out of the state
before his boys found her; then how would Jo punish her for trying to
leave? He had total control over her and such insubordination would
threaten his power; she wouldn’t be treated well. Emma was Skylar White;
she had no way out and nowhere to turn. Every person in Nauvoo she might
turn to was under Jo’s control or was one of his spies. She was an
island.

The final option would be to have Jo removed. If he died, yes the
children would be legally given to one of his brothers, but Emma could
likely make a hell of an argument that her surviving older brother,
Alva, should be the custodian of the children. She could move back to
Pennsylvania and continue to raise her children, find another nice man
to wed so she could legally be the guardian of her own children again
and life would go on.

Out of all these options, Joseph Smith dying presented the best possible
option for Emma to get her and her kids out of this dangerous situation.
At the end of the day, Jo probably had stomach ulcers. But the fact that
a reasonable person could conclude that Emma poisoned her own husband
means the situation was so far beyond salvageable or reasonable for her.
The Overton window of her life and the possible decisions she could make
had been dragged so far in the direction of insane by Joseph Smith that
poisoning him was a reasonable option. Beyond that she was poised in a
financial situation that she could feed the kids for years even if Jo’s
income from the church suddenly dried up.

However, Emma wasn’t completely powerless. She was still the elect lady
of Mormonism. She still held sway in the Relief Society. She watched out
for the welfare of polygamous wives and other women in Nauvoo,
especially her fellow elites. Even in the home she held a certain amount
of power, even if Jo only begrudgingly ceded ground. An interesting case
where this power dynamic is revealed has to do with the Nauvoo Mansion
and the bar Jo kept on the ground floor. This bar was for entertaining
dignitaries and visitors as well as his closest friends who could bend
the word of wisdom rules at their leisure. When it became too rowdy one
evening in early 1844 Emma requested Jo close the bar, which he did in
order to keep the peace. There were enough nearby grogshops for the
Mormons and visitors to satisfy their palate so the bar was removed and
Emma could no longer bother Jo with incessant requests to have it taken
out.

The Smith family had moved into the Nauvoo Mansion around August of
1843. There’s some evidence to indicate that they were living there
part-time as early as March of that year, but it isn’t included in Jo’s
journal that they moved until early August. One of the first
installations into the completed home was this bar because it was set to
be the Nauvoo Marriot with all the amenities expected of any nice hotel
in any major city.

The Nauvoo Mansion continued as a successful hotel business for the
months of September through December with the bar intact. Christmas day
festivities brought together a large gathering of friends and family,
which is recounted in the History of the Church. I’m reading from the
2015 Dan Vogel edition where it begins telling about some inconsiderate
Christmas carolers who showed up on the doorstep of the Nauvoo Mansion
at 1 in the damn morning\! The lovely Christmas festivities are
interrupted by a brawl with a faceless drunkard in the late evening.

Pistol Packin Porter Rockwell decided to crash the Christmas party in
the Nauvoo Mansion. As soon as Jo realized who this long-haired drunkard
was, he was elated to see his childhood friend here in Nauvoo instead of
continuing to languish in a Missouri prison where he’d spent nearly a
year. Why was he in a Missouri jail? Well the state suspected him in the
assassination attempt on former Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. Go back to
episode 109 where we discussed the documentation linking Port with the
assassination attempt. Then Port went into hiding for about 9 months to
keep from arrest and extradition to face the broken Missouri legal
system. All the while, the Bennett Meltdown transpired as Wreck-it
Bennett published articles about Jo and the Mormons while he collected
affidavits from citizens of Nauvoo. Port confronted Benentt in that same
episode 109 to try and get Bennett to stop publishing his accusations
that Jo sent Port to Missouri to kill Boggs. After hiding out for those
9 months, Port finally let down his guard in episode 142 and was
unexpectedly arrested as he attempted to board a ferry to Nauvoo. Since
early 1843 he’s been caught in the cogs of the Missouri legal system. Jo
sent Joseph H. Jackson to break Port out of prison in Spring of 43 but
the mission wasn’t successful. Now, Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell was
somehow here in Nauvoo, drunk, smelly, unkempt, and looking for a brawl
if anybody steps between him and the bar at the Nauvoo Mansion.

But how did he get here? What happened? Well, because the Mormons were
and still are incessant record keepers, after the party started back up
and Port had a few more in him, then slept off the hangover, he was put
down in front of a scribe to tell his story.

He tells of how he was arrested in St. Louis as he was boarding a ferry
to take him to Nauvoo. He then was put in a jail for two days with iron
hobbles around his ankles. During the journey from St. Louis to
Jefferson City, a guy was behind Port in the stagecoach was being
annoying and poking him in the back with something. When Port reacted,
the man’s wife whispered something in his ear, probably telling him he
was bothering the guy who shot Lilburn Boggs, and the man immediately
ceased his operations. Apparently the coach driver was so drunk he ran
them into a tree and a ditch, so Port eventually took over for him. Then
he tells about their arrival to Independence where a preliminary hearing
was held to ascertain whether or not the state had enough evidence to
move forward with a case against Port. He was committed to the
Independence Jail for safekeeping because the Judge expected a mob to
form and lynch ol Port.

Here in Independence, Pistol Packin’ Port tried his first escape attempt
when a guy was committed to his same cell with his saddle bags.

Port’s escape attempt failed. The excited crowd that gathered knew who
he was. This is the guy who tried to kill their hero, Lilburn Boggs. The
same Boggs who got rid of the Mormon problem; these people loved Boggs.
A guy named Smallwood Nowlin was the first guy to call for lynching. The
same sheriff who would arrest Joseph Smith in June of 1843, Sheriff
Reynolds, saw the crowd’s excitement.

The people knew that Port wasn’t going to go to the gallows without a
fight. Sheriff Reynolds took him to the upstairs of the jail and asked
for the tool Port used to cut off his ankle irons. The angry mob
followed them up the stairs and filled the small jail room. It was time
to lynch public enemy number one.

Whatever transpired in this tense situation, the historical record is
unclear because we only have Port’s recounting of the events. He claims
the crowd simply dispersed. I would be willing to bet that Sheriff
Reynolds stepped forward and said that Port is a prisoner in the custody
of the state of Missouri and will have a fair trial before we put him to
the gallows. But, Sheriff Reynolds was an avowed enemy of the Mormons
and I wouldn’t expect Port or any Mormon scribes to include such a
favorable thing coming from him. Port somehow evaded a mob lynching that
night, but Sheriff Reynolds wasn’t messing around anymore. He hobbled
Port by locking his right arm to his left ankle and left him like that
for a month before his next trial.

The next trial was hearing the criminal suit against him for breaking
out of prison. When asked if Port had any legal counsel, he selected
Alexander Doniphan, long-time friend of the Mormons who represented Jo
and the other Mormon elites in their November 1838 Court of Inquiry.
Doniphan had Port transferred to Liberty Jail, close to his home, making
it much easier for Doniphan to meet with Port periodically through his
forthcoming legal troubles. He spent about ten days in Liberty Jail,
which was more accommodating than every other jail he’d been in before,
although it was still horrible. But it wasn’t long-lived because after
those ten days he was remanded back to Independence for his hearing.

Port spent the next two months in the Independence Jail. This was spring
of 1843. Sheriff Reynolds paid Pistol Packin’ Porter a visit in the jail
to gloat about a new set of documents he had in hand that would get Jo
legally arrested and extradited to Missouri. This was in late June of 43
and Reynolds was about to leave for Nauvoo to arrest Jo. He thought that
maybe he could get Port to do his dirty work for him with a little offer
in exchange for Port’s freedom.

> then I won’t.”

Of course Port wouldn’t sell out his childhood friend and religious and
military leader, but Reynolds was smart to give it a try. Jo trusted
very few people with his life, but Port was one of them. If Sheriff
Reynolds could just get Port to take Jo to the right place at the right
time, it would make his job of extraditing Jo to Missouri much easier.
But, understandably, Port was loyal and refused to sell out Jo. The
feelings of powerlessness and inevitability overcame him. But, Port’s
feelings were allayed when he saw a sign he interpreted as divine.

Pistol Packin’ Porter continued to languish for another 2 months in the
Independence Jail when he was then conveyed back to Liberty Jail. While
there, he received a very kind visit from his mother, who gave him $100
so he could pay Doniphan’s legal fees.

In Liberty, Port attempted his next escape, not the first Mormon to try
to break out of Liberty Jail. Instead of trying to dig through the walls
like Joseph Smith had attempted, Port instead removed the smoke stack
from the potbelly stove in the dungeon and crawled through the exhaust
hole. Unfortunately for him, though, he could barely fit through the
hole to the main floor, but couldn’t break out the door. He gave up and
laid down on the floor of the main story and waited for the jailers to
find him there the next morning. They did and “it caused quite an
excitement.”

Port’s final trial was scheduled for two weeks in the future. Somebody
appeared in the night and offered him freedom, but Port decided it best
to stick it out for the two weeks and go to trial instead of escaping
jail and continuing to have the state of Missouri on his tail. This was
a good decision. Yes, Port had to stand trial for trying to break out of
jail, but the state simply didn’t have any evidence that he pulled the
trigger on Boggs back in May of the previous year. All the state had was
Boggs affidavit that pointed the finger at Port and Jo, but Boggs didn’t
see the assassin, he was just sitting in his study and bullets crashed
through the window unexpectedly. He was struck in the head and neck by
the buckshot and never saw who was on the other side of the window.
There was no hard evidence connecting Port to the attempt, and Port knew
that. His legal counsel, Doniphan, knew that. The state prosecutor knew
that the state didn’t have proof. He was best to just deal with being in
jail for another 2 weeks.

His trial came, and this is how Pistol Packin’ Port tells the story.

> The trial came according to my last notification; I was tried for
> breaking Independence jail; and although the law of Missouri reads
> that in order to break jail, a man must break a lock, a door or a
> wall, still Judge King ruled that it was breaking jail to walk out
> when the door is open, and under this ruling the jury brought in a
> verdict of “five minutes” imprisonment in the county jail, but I was

> made to get up some other charge against me.

Why did the court find that five minutes of jail time was a fitting
punishment for trying to break out of jail? Why did it simply decide to
let Port go? The answer is simple, mob law. Orrin Porter Rockwell was
public enemy number one of Missouri and he was in state custody. Once he
was released, he had a journey of a few hundred miles before he reached
the safety of Illinois, and the people knew that. He’d have to travel
home upon his release which provided plenty opportunity for the mob to
catch up and have their way with him. Sure, Port wasn’t found guilty,
but the court of public opinion had ruled the death sentence for Port a
year and a half ago. They’d certainly enforce their own ruling as soon
as he was out of state custody. This sentiment was not lost on Port or
his legal counsel, Doniphan.

Port continued his journey. He traveled largely by night and never on
well-traveled roads. He stayed with some nice people, gave them 50 cents
here and there for boarding him for the night and providing him with
food. A nice man even provided Port with some whiskey for one of his
nights. He occasionally hired drivers and people with horses to carry
him some distance, which he says “was a very great relief to my weary
feet.” He also popped in to Haun’s mill to pay his respects to his
fallen brothers in the covenant. After two weeks of walking and riding
back roads towards Nauvoo, his journey through hostile territory finally
came to its end.

What a glorious reunion on Christmas day this was. Jo’s primary enforcer
was now free from the Missouri mobocrats. He’d spent a year and a half
away from the Kingdom on the Mississippi, over 9 months in various jails
all over Missouri, facing trials, attempting to escape, evading lynch
mobs against all odds, and now, Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell made his
triumphant return. He was unkempt, dirty, and undernourished. While what
we read was recorded the day after Port’s return to Nauvoo, he was the
center of the Christmas party when his return was discovered. He
recounted the above story to everybody in attendance while the drinks
flowed freely.

When he concluded his regaling, Jo pronounced a prophecy that has become
iconic when discussing Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell in Mormon history,
and it’s one of Jo’s few prophecies that actually came true in spite of
all odds.

> “I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that you—Orrin Porter
> Rockwell—so long as ye shall remain loyal and true to thy faith,
> need fear no enemy. Cut not thy hair and no bullet or blade can harm
> thee\!”

The exact wording of this prophecy was never recorded in any official
church publication, but Port carried those words with him to his grave
in Utah decades later and frequently told friends and family of the
prophecy placed upon his head. This turned Pistol Packin’ Port into the
Samson of Mormonism. He went through the rest of his life, through many
altercations, dozens of assassinations, frequent battles with Native
Americans, and he was never shot or stabbed his entire life after this
prophecy was given. He died an old man in 1878, an outlaw, a bastard,
with a bloody life behind him. He only cut his hair once before his
death in order to make a wig for Agnes Coolbrith Smith, widow of Don
Carlos and Joseph Smith.

Now, if anybody, Emma or anybody else, tried to poison or harm the
prophet in any way, they would once again fear a midnight visit from the
destroying angel of Mormonism.
