Ep 166 – Joseph Smith’s POTUS Platform

On this episode, we read Jo’s POTUS campaign pamphlet. On Jan. 29, 1844,
JS was nominated for President of the United States. What immediately
followed was his calling for various church leaders to canvass high
population areas to electioneer and commissioning William W. Phelps to
write out his campaign platform. We read it top to bottom and discuss
the historical importance and context for each paragraph. After that
we’re joined by Mary and Shelly of Latter-day Lesbian Podcast to talk
about their show and do a FUMPOTD. Check out their show in the links
below. Also, if you’re in the SLC area or are going to Sunstone
Symposium this weekend, come hang out at Club 90 this Friday 8/2/19\!

The Mormons had a lot of trouble with the legal system. This was a
running motif through all of Jo’s leadership of the religious sect, they
were rarely on the right side of the law. Whether we focus on Kirtland,
Ohio, Far West, Missouri, or Nauvoo, Illinois, the major headquarters of
the church were constantly at battle with the legal system in one way or
another. Missouri in 1838 was the most overtly lawless and
anti-government period of the church.

After the Mormons were removed from Missouri due to the war, their
surrender, and Governor Boggs’ extermination order, they decided to be
lawless within the confines of the law. One of the first items on Jo’s
to-do list upon his escape from jail in 1839 was to collect dozens of
affidavits from various members and leaders of the church petitioning
the federal government for redress. The Mormons wanted to be paid for
their mistreatment. These initial petitions were taken by Jo, Hingepin
Rigdon, Pistol Packin Porter Rockwell, and Doctor Bob the Builder Robert
D. Foster to the federal legislature. Jo met with President Martin Van
Buren and was denied. Van Buren claimed if he did anything to help the
Mormons out of their perilous situation “he would come into contact with
the whole state of Missouri,” which was an accurate assessment.
According to Jo, the president told him “your cause is just, but I can
do nothing for you.”

Van Buren had to weigh in the balance his next election. Jo, angry with
the outcome of their meeting, returned to Commerce, Illinois, soon to be
Nauvoo, and proclaimed along his trip home that Van Buren was corrupt
and wouldn’t help the Mormons achieve justice. He called Van Buren “a
fop or fool,” said he thought that Van Buren was “without boddy or
parts, as no one part seems to be proportioned to another.” He declared
repeatedly “We do not say the Saints shall not vote for him, but we do
say boldly,… that we do not intend he shall have our votes.”

Van Buren’s treatment of the Mormons didn’t really have an effect on his
campaign, although it certainly didn’t help. The nation was in turmoil
following the Panic of 1837 and the following recession. Many voters
were extremely upset with how Van Buren carried out Jackson’s Indian
Removal Act and his general treatment of many native tribes. The Whigs
took the seat of president with a grassroots movement in the 1840
election. The backcountry hero of Tippecanoe, William Henry Harrison,
sat as president for a month before he died in office, which promoted
John Tyler, a member of the wealthy elite of Washington. This was one of
the death knells of the Whig party.

Americans, Mormons included, were looking for a fresh face in the 1844
election. The main issues which divided the parties of the day were
slavery and territorial expansion. There were many other issues that
comprised, unified, or divided the Whigs and the Democrats, but these
were the hotbutton issues of 1844.

The Mormons all had their own political and social leanings, but more
than anything they would vote for anybody who would grant the most
leniency and privileges to their religious society. Accordingly, it was
time for the Mormons to put up their favorite person as presidential
candidate for 1844, even the prophet Joseph Smith. The History of the
Church includes Jo’s journal entry for Jan 29, 1844, which reads as
follows:

> Monday, 29.—… The Twelve Apostles, together with my brother Hyrum and
> J\[ohn\] P. Greene, met at the Mayor’s office, to take into
> consideration the proper course for this people to pursue in relation
> to the coming Presidential election.
> 
> The candidates for the office of President of the United States at
> present before the people are Martin Van Buren and Henry Clay. It is
> morally impossible for this people, in justice to themselves, to vote
> for the re-election of President Van Buren, a man who criminally
> neglected his duties as chief magistrate, in the cold and unblushing
> manner which he did, when appealed to for aid in the Missouri
> difficulties. His heartless reply burns like a firebrand in the breast
> of every true friend of liberty, “*Your cause I just, but I can do
> nothing for you*.”
> 
> As to Mr. Clay, his sentiments and cool contempt of the people’s
> rights are manifested in his reply, “*you had better go to Oregon for

> privileges, from supporting him at the ballot-box.
> 
> It was therefore moved by Willard Richards, and voted unanimously,
> “that we will have an independent electoral ticket, and that Joseph
> Smith be a candidate for the next Presidency; and that we use all

One doesn’t just run for president and then magically get elected. Some
business had to be attended to in order to make this nomination
official.

> “I dictated to brother Phelps the heads of my pamphlet, entitled,
> “Views on the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United
> States.”

Let’s discuss this. We’re getting into 1844 in our historical timeline
and things begin to accelerate very quickly this year, if we weren’t
already sitting at breakneck pace with interesting history. Nauvoo was
seen as the place from which the Mormon President could rule the nation.
Captain White saying “may Nauvoo become the empire seat of the
government” reveals the ideology behind this presidential nomination. Jo
had quite a few irons in the fire. Talos was nearing completion; the
Mormon war machine was close to booting up and waging total destruction
on any opposed to the Mormon theocracy.

The simple fact remains that a person can’t overthrow a nation without
some powerful organizations underneath them to keep everything
organized. Organized crime is more effective than one guy holding up a
gas station with a gun. The Mormons needed a proper system of
organization to govern America once Jo took the election, or took the
nation by military force; the peaceable option was preferred. The
Council of Fifty was organized barely a month after Jo announced his
presidential candidacy. The Council of Fifty will be our next special
multi-part series because it’s so crucial to understanding the remainder
of Nauvoo history, which we’ll begin in two weeks.

For today, however, let’s discuss the inciting incident that created the
Council of Fifty, Jo’s bid for the country’s presidency. We’re going to
read his campaign pamphlet top to bottom. Why read the whole thing?
Well, if you ever want to know what his campaign platform was on
specific issues, you have to read the whole thing and listening to me
read it is just as good as reading it for yourself. Plus, we get to
discuss what everything means within the context of the 1840s and where
Jo was trying to plant his various platform flags. Yes, there will be
superfluous information in this podcast, but y’all have probably come to
expect that by now from yours truly. I try to make this show useful as
reference material, even if my commentary of the sources is usually
terrible. I find it’s better to be over rather than underinformed.
You’ll find a link to this in the show notes. Stick around after we
read through this to hear a special little segment with two guest I’m
very excited to have on the show.

Born in a land of liberty, and breathing an air uncorrupted with
the sirocco of barbarous climes, I ever feel a double anxiety for the
happiness of all men, both in time and in eternity. My cogitations like
Daniel’s, have for a long time troubled me, when I viewed the condition
of men throughout the world, and more especially in this boasted realm,
where the Declaration of Independence “holds these truths to be self
evident; that all men are created equal: that they are endowed by their
Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” but at the same time, some two
or three millions of people are held as slaves for life, because the
spirit in them is covered with a darker skin than ours: and hundreds of
our own kindred for an infraction, or supposed infraction of some
over-wise statute, have to be incarcerated in dungeon glooms, or suffer
the more moral penitentiary gravitation of mercy in a nut-shell, while
the duellist, the debauchee, and the defaulter for millions, and
other criminals, take the uppermost rooms at feasts, or, like the bird
of passage find a more congenial clime by flight.

(Populism, rallying up the poor masses against the powerful criminal
elite)

The wisdom, which ought to characterize the freest, wisest, and
most noble nation of the nineteenth century, should, like the sun in
his meridian splendor, warm every object beneath its rays: and the main
efforts of her officers, who are nothing more or less than the servants
of the people, ought to be directed to ameliorate the condition of all:
black or white, bond or free; for the best of books says, “God hath made
of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the
earth.”

Our
common [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#1925206849113032440) presents
to all men the same advantages; the same facilities; the same prospects;
the same honors; and the same rewards: and without hypocrisy, the
Constitution when it says, “We, the People of the [United
States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#3568066490990242408),
in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure
tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the
general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the [United
States of
America](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#1314440570156709754),” meant
just what it said, without reference to color or condition: ad
infinitum. \[p. \[3\]\] The aspirations and expectations of a virtuous
people, environed with so wise, so liberal, so deep, so broad, and so
high a charter of equal rights, as appears in said Constitution, ought
to be treated by those to whom the administration of the laws are
intrusted, with as much sanctity, as the prayers of the saints are
treated in heaven, that love, confidence and union, like the sun, moon
and stars should bear witness,

(For ever singing as they shine,)

“The hand that made us is divine\!”

Unity is power, and when I reflect on the importance of it to the
stability of all governments, I am astounded at the silly moves of
persons and parties, to foment discord in order to ride into power on
the current of popular excitement; nor am I less surprized at the
stretches of power, or restrictions of right, which too often appear as
acts of legislators, to pave the way to some favorite political schemes,
as destitute of intrinsic merit, as a wolf’s heart is of the milk of
human kindness: a Frenchman would say, “prosque tout aimer richesses et
pouvoir:” (almost all men like wealth and power.)

(Once again, pitting the poor masses against the wealthy elite. It’s a
populist dogwhistle coming from Joseph Smith, one of the wealthiest men
in Illinois, Mayor of his own city, religious leader to over ten
thousand, and commander-in-chief of his own militia.)

I must dwell on this subject longer than others, for nearly one
hundred years ago that golden patriot, Benjamin Franklin, drew up a
plan of union for the then Colonies of Great Britain that now are such
an
Independent [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16416796132939792271),
which among many wise provisions for obedient children under
their father’s more rugged hand, had this:—“they have power to make
laws, and lay and levy such general duties, imports, or taxes, as to
them shall appear most equal and just, (considering the ability and
other circumstances of the inhabitants in the several colonies,) and
such as may be collected with the least inconvenience to the people;
rather discouraging luxury, than loading industry with unnecessary
burthens.” Great Britain surely lacked the laudable humanity and
fostering clemency to grant such a just plan of union—but the sentiment
remains like the land that honor’d its birth, as a pattern for wise
men to study the convenience of the people more than the comfort of the
cabinet.

And one of the most noble fathers of our freedom
and [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#14973383535381356766)’s
glory: great in war, great in peace, great in the estimation of the
world, and great in the hearts of his countrymen, the illustrious
\[George\] Washington, said in his first inaugural address to Congress:
“I behold the surest pledges that as, on one side, no local prejudices
or attachments, no separate views or party animosities, will misdirect
the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great
assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the
foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and
immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of
free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the
affections of its citizens, and command the respect of the world.”
Verily, here shines the virtue and the wisdom of a statesman in such
lucid rays that had every succeeding Congress followed the rich
instruction, in all their deliberations and enactments, for the benefits
and convenience of the whole community and the communities of which it
is composed, no sound of a rebellion in South Carolina; no rupture in
Rhode Island; no mob
in [Missouri](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8627333597831969067) expelling her
citizens by executive authority; corruption in the ballot boxes; a
border warfare
between [Ohio](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#13318235974655078460) and [Michigan](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#15755048901408377664):
hard times and distress: oubreak upon outbreak in the principal cities:
murder, robbery, and defalcation, scarcity of money, and a thousand
other difficulties, would have torn asunder the \[p. 4\] bonds of
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#7931314922794669505):
destroyed the confidence of man; and left the the great body of the
people to mourn over misfortunes in poverty, brought on by corrupt
legislation in an hour of proud vanity, for self aggrandizement. The
great Washington, soon after the foregoing faithful admonition for
the common welfare of
his [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#15699220762492851180),
further advised Congress that “among the many interesting objects which
will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence
will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the most
effectual means of preserving peace.” As the Italian would say: Buono
aviso, (good advice.)

(Tread lightly and carry a big stick, and never cease to care for the
veterans)

The elder \[John\] Adams in his inaugural address, gives national pride
such a grand turn of justification, that every honest citizen must look
back upon the infancy of the [United
States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#6621027716381962808) with
an approving smile and rejoice, that patriotism in the rulers, virtue in
the people, and prosperity in
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#3421094125886459630),
once crowned the expectations of hope; unveiled the sophistry of the
hypocrite and silenced the folly of foes: Mr. Adams said, “If national
pride is ever justifiable, or excusable, it is when it springs not
from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of
national innocence, information and benevolence.” There is no doubt such
was actually the case with our young realm at the close of the last
century; peace, prosperity, and union, filled
the [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#13309550048280979641) with
religious toleration, temporal enjoyment and virtuous enterprize; and
gradually, too, when the deadly winter of the “Stamp Aact,” the “Tea
Act,” and other close communion acts of royalty had choked the growth of
freedom of speech, liberty of the press, and liberty of conscience, did
light, liberty and loyalty flourish like the cedars of God.

(Patriotism has always been a battle cry of presidential hopefuls. Many
presidential candidates today could plagiarize this word for word and it
would mean just as much today as it did in 1844.)

The respected and venerable Thomas Jefferson, in his inaugural
address, made more than forty years ago, shews what a beautiful
prospect an innocent, virtuous nation presents to the sage’s eye, where
there is space for enterprize: hands for industry: heads for heroes: and
hearts for moral greatness. He said, “A rising nation, spread over a
wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with the rich
productions of their industry, engaged in commerce with nations who feel
power and forget right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach
of mortal eye; when I contemplate these transcendant objects, and see
the honor, the happiness, and the hopes of this
beloved [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#1354820463481619767) committed
to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the
contemplation, and humble myself before the magnitude of the
undertaking.” Such a prospect was truly soul stirring to a good man, but
“since the Father’s have fallen asleep,” wicked and designing men, have
unrobed the government of its glory,—and the people, if not in dust
and ashes, or in sack cloth, have to lament in poverty, her departed
greatness: while demagogues build fires in the north and south, east and
west, to keep up their spirits till it is better times: but year after
year has left the people to hope till the very name of Congress,
or State Legislature, is as horrible to the sensitive friend of his
country, as the house of “Blue Beard” is to children; or “Crockett’s”
Hell
of [London](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#2685215634040568752),
to meek men. When the people are secure and their rights properly
respected, then the four main pillars of prosperity, viz: agriculture,
manufactures, navigation, and commerce, need the fostering care of
government: and in so goodly
a [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8327594352029529347) as
ours, where the soil, the climate, the rivers, the lakes, and the sea
coast; the productions, the timber, the minerals; and the inhabitants
are so diversified (as long as you’re white), that a pleasing
variety accommodates all tastes, trades, and calculations, it certainly
is the highest point of subversion to protect the whole northern and
southern, eastern and western, centre and circumference of the realm, by
a judicious tariff. It is \[p. 5\] an old saying and a true one, “if you
wish to be respected, respect yourselves.”

(This was an amazing passage coming from a demagogue who was actively
subverting the U.S. Constitution.)

I will adopt, in part, the language of Mr. \[James\] Madison’s inaugural
address, “To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations,
having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality
towards belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion
and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an
appeal to arms; to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities,
so degrading to all countries, and so baneful to free ones; to foster a
spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others, too
proud to surrender our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudicies
ourselves, and too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to
hold
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#12936945246786697560) of
the States as the bases of their peace and happiness; to support the
constitution, which is the cement of
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#18037370752337059909),
as well as in its limitatons as in its authorities; to respect the
rights and authorities reserved to the States and to the people, as
equally incorporated with, and essential to the success, of the general
system; to avoid the slightest interference with the rights of
conscience, or the functions of religion, so wisely exempted from civil
jurisdiction; to preserve in their full energy, the other salutary
provisions in behalf of private and personal rights, and of the freedom
of the press;” as far as intention aids in the fulfilment of duty, are
consummations to big with benefits not to captivate the energies of
all honest men to achieve them, when they can be brought to pass by
reciprocation, friendly alliances, wise legislation, and honorable
treaties.

(Once again, this passage only applies if you’re a country of white
people, even to this day. Had this philosophy been applied to various
Native American tribes, American history would look very different
today.)

The government has once flourished under the guidance of trusty
servants; and the Hon. Mr. Munroe \[James Monroe\] in his day, while
speaking of the Constitution: says, “our commerce has been wisely
regulated with foreign nations, and between the states; new states have
been admitted into
our [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#12166627414890092103);
our teritory has been enlarged by fair and honorable treaty, and with
great advantage to the original states; the states respectively
protected by the national government, under a mild paternal system
against foreign dangers, and enjoying within their separate spheres, by
a wise partition of power, a just proportion of the sovereignty, have
improved their police, extended their settlements, and attained a
strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholsome law well
administered. And if we look to the condition of individuals, what a
proud spectacle does it exhibit? who has been deprived of any right of
person and property? (Uhhh… Native Americans. African Americans. Chinese
Americans. Catholics from Ireland and Italy. Really anybody who wasn’t
white Protestant was deprived of rights at this time.) who restrained
from offering his vows in the mode in which he prefers, to the Divine
Author of his being? It is well known that all these blessings have been
enjoyed to their fullest extent; and I add, with peculiar satisfaction,
that there has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted
on any one for the crime of high treason.” What a delightful picture, of
power, policy and prosperity\! Truly the wise man’s proverb is just:
“Sedàukauh teromáin goy, veh-ka-sade le-u-méem khahmàut.”
Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

(Capital punishment has never been served for the crime of high treason…
That’s only true in the civil sense because people were executed as a
result of court martials all the time when they committed treason. This
is just vacuous nonsense and a mountain of lies we expect to come from a
politician, especially one who had committed treason and was running for
president.)

But this is not all. The same honorable statesman, after having had
about forty years experience in the government, under the full tide of
successful experiment, gives the following commendatory assurance of the
efficiency of the magna charta to answer its great end and aim: To
protect the people in their rights. “Such, then, is the happy government
under which we live; a government adequate to every purpose for which
the social compact is formed; a government elective in all its branches,
under which every cit \[p. 6\] izen may, by his merit, obtain the
highest trust recognized by the constitution; which contains within it
no cause or discord; none to put at variance one portion of the
community with another; a government which protects every citizen in the
full enjoyment of his rights, and is able to protect the nation against
injusice from foreign powers.”

Again, the younger [\[John Quincy\]
Adams](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#17081549225601089158) in
the silver age of
our [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9149113278131001581)’s
advancement to fame, in his inaugural address, (1825) thus candidly
declares the majesty of the
youthful [Republic](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#14797223857166440183),
in its increasing greatness, “The year of jubilee since the first
formation of
our [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#14994693367555234039) has
just elapsed; that of the declaration of Independence is at hand. The
consummation of both was effected by this constitution. Since that
period, a population of four millions has multiplied to twelve. A
territory, bounded by
the [Mississippi](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8397938420693566319),
has been extended from sea to sea. New states have been admitted to
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16032958660738460700),
in numbers nearly equal to those of the first confederation. Treaties of
peace, amity and commerce, have been concluded with the principal
dominions of the earth. The people of other nations, the inhabitants of
regions acquired, not by conquest, but by compact, have been united with
us in the participation of our rights and duties, of our burdens and
blessings. (This was literally 6 years after the Trail of Tears…) The
forest has fallen by the axe of our woodsmen; the soil has been made to
teem by the tillage of our farmers: our commerce has whitened every
ocean. The dominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the
invention of our artists. Liberty and law have walked hand in hand. All
the purposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively
as under any other government on the globe, and at a cost little
exceeding, in a whole generation, the expenditures of other nations in a
single year.\[”\]

In continuation of such noble sentiments, Gen. \[Andrew\] Jackson, upon
his ascension to the great chair of the chief magistracy: said, “As long
as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is
regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of
person and property, liberty of conscience, and of the press, it will be
worth defending; and so long as it is worth defending, a patriotic
militia will cover it with an impenetrable aegis.”

General Jackson’s administration may be denomiated the acme of American
glory, liberty and prosperity, for the national debt, which in 1815,
on account of the late war, was $125,000,000, and lessened gradually,
was paid up in his golden day; and preparations were made to distribute
the surplus revenue among the several states: and that august patriot,
to use his own words in his farewell address, retired leaving “a great
people prosperous and happy, in the full enjoyment of liberty and peace,
honored and respected by every nation of the world.”

(There you go, leave it to a Democrat to balance the damn budget.
Jackson was a horrible human being who led a controversial presidency
and he was responsible for genocide, but hey, the account books looked
really good when he left office so it’s all good. Panic of 1837? What?
Nah let’s forget that too.)

At the age, then, of sixty years our
blooming [Republic](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9831431747432026684) began
to decline under the withering touch of [Martin Van
Buren](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16729630867444112392)\!
Disappointed ambition; thirst for power, pride, corruption, party
spirit, faction, patronage; perquisites, fame, tangling alliances;
priest-craft and spiritual wickedness in high places, struck hands, and
revelled in midnight splendor. Trouble, vexation, perplexity and
contention, mingled with hope, fear and murmuring, rumbled through
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#15090142516888606866) and
agitated the
whole [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#5016514226138109821) as
would an earthquake at the centre of the earth the world, heaving the
sea beyond its bounds, and shaking the everlasting hills: So, in hopes
of better times, while jealousy, hypocritical pretensions, and pompous
ambition, were luxuriating on the ill- \[p. 7\]gotten spoils of the
people, they rose in their majesty like a tornado, and swept through the
land, till General \[William Henry\] Harrison appeared, as a star among
the storm clouds, for better weather.

(Van Buren inherited a nation on the brink of financial collapse. The
Republicans put measures into our economy that insured the collapse of
2008 that Obama inherited; the same happened with the transition of
Jackson to Van Buren. People at this time hated Van Buren because they
refused to see what Jackson had done that actually caused the Panic of
1837.)

The calm came; and the language of that venerable patriot (Harrison), in
his inaugural address, while descanting upon the merits of the
constitution and its framers, thus expressed himself. “There were in it,
features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a
simple representative democracy or republic. And knowing the tendency of
power to increase itself, particularly when executed by a single
individual, predictions were made that, at no very remote period, the
government would terminate in virtual monarchy. It would not become me
to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized. But
as I sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men’s
opinions, for some years past, has been in that direction, it is, I
conceive, strictly proper that I should take this occasion to repeat the
assurances I have heretofore given, of my determination to arrest the
progress of that tendency if it really exists, and restore the
government to its pristine health and vigor.” This good man died before
he had the opportunity of applying one balm to ease the pain of our
groaning [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16080288759490346631),

be the judge, whether General Harrison, in his exalted station, upon the
eve of his entrance into the world of spirits, told the truth or
not: with acting [president \[John\]

three years of perplexity and pseudo whig democrat reign, to heal the
breaches, or show the wounds, secundum artum, (according to art.)
Subsequent events, all things considered, [Van

self-sufficient turn to the whole, go to shew, as a Chaldean might
exclaim: Berám etái eláuh beshmayáuh gauháh rauzéen: (Certainly there is
a God in heaven to reveal secrets;

(The world was on the brink of collapse in 1844 just like it is today.)

No honest man can doubt for a moment, but the glory of American liberty,
is on the wane; and, that calamity and confusion will sooner or
later, destroy the peace of the people. Speculators will urge a
national bank as a savior of credit and comfort. A hireling puseudo
priesthood will plausibly push abolition doctrines and doings, and
“human rights,” into Congress and into every otner \[other\] place,
where conquest smells of fame, or opposition swells to popularity.
Democracy, Whiggery and Cliquery, will attract their elements and foment
divisions among the people, to accomplish fancied schemes and accumulate
power, while poverty driven to despair, like hunger forcing its way
through a wall, will break through the statutes of men, to save
life, and mend the breach in prison glooms.

(We’re still kind of waiting for this to happen, at least some talking
heads in the media or politicians are…)

A still higher grade, of what the “nobility of nations” call “great
men,” will dally with all rights in order to smuggle a fortune at “one
fell
swoop:” mortgage [Texas](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9406093475747735935),
possess [Oregon](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8164620807411475720),
and claim all the unsettled regions of the world for hunting and
trapping: and should a humble honest man, red, black, or white, exhibit
a better title, these gentry have only to clothe the judge with richer
ermine, and spangle the lawyer’s fingers with finer rings, to have the
judgment of his peers, and the honor of his lords, as a pattern
of honesty, virtue and humanity, while the motto hangs on his nation’s
escutcheon: “Every man has his price\!”

(Yes, the rich get richer. Power begets power. And the little guys foot
the bill. These trends have always existed in every single government
across the world for as long as we have history. What’s even more
interesting about it is when somebody like Joseph Smith, a wealthy elite
at this time, is using these buzzwords and talking points to rally up a
populist groundswell to support him. Everything is horrible, all the
rich people are taking your money and you’re paying all the taxes. But,
elect me, yet another rich white guy, and I’ll make all your problems go
away.)

Now, oh\! people\! people\! turn unto the Lord and live; and reform
this [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8188486767918109983).
Frustrate the designs of wicked men. Reduce Congress at least one half.
Two Senators from a state and two members to a million of popu \[p.
8\]lation, will do more business than the army that now occupy the halls
of the National Legislature. Pay them two dollars and their board per
diem; (except Sundays,) that is more than the farmer gets, and he lives
honestly. Ourtail \[Curtail\] the offices of government in pay, number
and power, for the Philistine lords have shorn
our [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#11435566539158781644) of
its goodly locks in the lap of Delilah.

(Small government is such a platform issue, but I would argue that
rarely are major societal ills made better when government is reduced.
There’s a reason we wait for 3 hours in line at the DMV to fill out and
turn in one form proving we are who we say we are. There’s a reason why
all of our government agencies lag behind all our private companies in
nearly every possible metric; because they’ve been shrunken through
systematic vilification as a political platform. But hey, if we just
remove all regulation, things always get better for everybody, right?\!
Hollow assurances to a slave or a 4-year-old coal miner at this time.)

Petition your state legislatures to pardon every convict in their
several penitentiaries: blessing them as they go, and saying to them in
the name of the Lord, go thy way and sin no more. (That is truly an
appalling platform. Pardon every criminal, that’ll make society great\!)
Advise your legislators when they make laws for larceny, burglary or any
felony, to make the penalty applicable to work upon roads, public works,
or any place where the culprit can be taught more wisdom and more
virtue; and become more enlightened. Rigor and seclusion will never do
as much to reform the propensities of man, as reason and friendship.
(I’m all for reforming our criminal justice system and abolishing
for-profit prisons. Very little actual rehabilitation happens in our
current system and I’m sure it was much worse in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century. But, just letting everyone go and telling them to be nice is
absolutely insane.) Murder only can claim confinement or death. Let the
penitentiaries be turned into seminaries of learning, where
intelligence, like the angels of heaven, would banish such fragments of
barbarism: Imprisonment for debt is a meaner practice than the savage
tolerates with all his ferocity. “Amor vincit omnia.” Love conquers all.

Petition also, ye goodly inhabitants of the slave states, your
legislators to abolish slavery by the year 1850, or now, and save the
abolitionist from reproach and ruin, infamy and shame. (We discussed
last episode Jo’s fluid morality on the question of slavery. He could
see the writing on the wall. Jo could tell where the world of politics
and slavery was headed, anybody with their head screwed on the right
direction could tell slavery was on its way out. It’s important to
realize that he was taking this stance because it was politically
better; whether or not his own morals played into this platform item is
the subject of speculation only. His methods of abolishing slavery are
quite interesting.) Pray Congress to pay every man a reasonable price
for his slaves out of the surplus revenue arising from the sale of
public lands, and from the deduction of pay from the members of
Congress. (So…. All the land us Americans are stealing from the Natives…
sell it at a good price and buy the slaves back from slave owners, just
so they’re fairly compensated for their troubles of owning people as
property. This isn’t robbing Peter to pay Paul; this is committing
genocide on Mexicans to put Africans on probation. I can scarcely think
of a more deplorable way to fix the 19<sup>th</sup>-century societal
issue of slavery than doing it Jo’s way.) Break off the shackles from
the poor black man, and hire him to labor like other human beings; for
“an hour of virtuous liberty on earth, is worth a whole eternity of
bondage\!” Abolish the practice in the army and navy of trying men by
court martial for desertion; if a soldier or marine runs away, send him
his wages, with the instruction, that his country will never trust him
again; he has forfeited his honor. Make HONOR the standard with all men:
be sure that good is rendered for evil in all cases: and the
whole [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9973847762635347470),
like a kingdom of kings and priests, will rise up with righteousness:
and be respected as wise and worthy on earth: and as just and holy for
heaven, by Jehovah the author of perfection. More economy in the
national and state governments, would make less taxes among the
people: more equality through the cities, towns
and [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#17341013955969599172),
would make less distinction among the people; and more honesty and
familiarity in societies, would make less hypocrisy and flattery in all
branches of community; and open, frank, candid, decorum to all men, in
this boasted land of liberty, would beget esteem, confidence, union and
love; and the neighbor from any state, or from any country, of whatever
color, clime or tongue, could rejoice when he put his foot on the sacred
soil of freedom, and exclaim: the very name of “American,” is fraught
with friendship\! Oh\! then, create confidence\! restore freedom\! break
down slavery\! banish imprisonment for debt, and be in love, fellowship
and peace with all the world\! Remember that honesty is not subject to
law: the law was made for transgressors: wherefore a Dutchman might
exclaim: Ein ehrlicher name ist besser als Reichthum, (a good name is
better than riches.)

(All of those words arranged in that order meant absolutely nothing. It
sounds so nice, be honest, make America great, less hypocrisy, more
equality. Those are just platitude that don’t mean anything coming from
a person who has absolutely no plan or idea to actual enact any of these
high-minded ideals. I gotta say, as a politician, Jo is swingin par for
the course.)

For the accommodation of the people in every state and territory, let
Congress shew their wisdom by granting a national bank, with branches in
each state and territory, where the capital stock shall be held by
the [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#11974026700361288763) for the
mother bank: and by the states and territories, for the branches:
and whose officers and directors shall be elected yearly by the people
with wages \[p. 9\] at the rate of two dollars per day for services:
which several banks shall never issue any more bills than the amount of
capital stock in her vaults and the interest. The nett gain of the
mother bank shall be applied to the national revenue, and that of the
branches to the states and territories’ revenues. And the bills shall be
par throughout
the [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9179123638858112746),
which will mercifully cure that fatal disorder know in cities,
as brokerage; and leave the people’s money in their own pockets.

(A federal bank was a major hotbutton issue of the early 1800s.
President Jackson vehemently opposed a national bank, vetoed the charter
renewal bill, removed the federal funds from the national bank, and
signed the specie circular, all moves that collapsed the economy and
sent America into a massive depression. The first national bank had been
established by George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, but the board
who ran it were all industrialist businessmen with tons of political and
social power, which helped subjugate lower class Americans and
slave-owning farmers. Jackson made his opposition to a federal bank a
rally cry and formed this anti-federal bank into the original platform
of the Democrat party. Jo planted his flag firmly in favor of a federal
bank, which was the Whig position and therefore the position of the
wealthy industrialist folk, of which Jo was a part.)

Give every man his constituttional freedom, and the president full
power to send an army to suppress mobs; and the states authority to
repeal and impugn that relic of folly, which makes it necessary for the
governor of a state to make the demand of the president for troops, in
cases of invasion or rebellion The governor himself may be a mobber and,
instead of being punished, as he should be for murder and treason, he
may destroy the very lives, rights, and property he should protect.
(This, obviously, was a result of Mormon treatment in Missouri. Jo
wanted the President to call in a militia to reinstate the Mormons to
their claimed property in Missouri, but President Van Buren refused to
help. Jo wanted himself, as president, to have the power to call a
national militia to a given location, even if the Governor of that state
opposed.) Like the good Samaritan, send every lawyer as soon as he
repents and obeys the ordinances of heaven, to preach the gospel to the
destitute, without purse or scrip, pouring in the oil and the wine: a
learned priesthood is certainly more honorable than “an hireling
clergy.”

As to the contiguous territories to the [United

Columbia; thus may union be strengthened, and foreign speculation
prevented from opposing broadside to broadside.

(Jo took a hardline expansionist view of American territory annexation.
The annexation of Texas was one of the greatest political issues of the
mid 1840s. Jo, in this campaign pamphlet, not only encourages the
annexation of Texas, but of Canada and Mexico too. That’s pretty
sweeping, but also understandable. If he was to be president, he wanted
to be president of as much territory as humanly possible.)

Seventy years have done much for this goodly land; they have burst

blessed [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#13116160975183227235)?
The southern people are hospitable and noble: they will help to rid
so free a country of every vestige of slavery, when ever they are
assured of an equivalent for their property. (Uh, no, they wouldn’t.
America literally fought a war over the question of slavery.)
The [country](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9778278886987156299) will
be full of money and confidence, when a national bank of twenty
millions, and a state bank in every state, with a million or more, gives
a tone to monetary matters, and make a circulating medium as valuable in
the purses of a whole community, as in the coffers of a speculating
banker or broker.

The people may have faults but they never should be trifled with. I
think Mr. \[William\] Pitt’s quotation in the British Parliament of Mr.
\[Matthew\] Prior’s couplet for the husband and wife, to apply to the
course which the king and ministry
of [England](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8295765902123327487) should
pursue to the then colonies, of the now [United
States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#4023785191513003636),
might be \[p. 10\] a genuine rule of action for some of the breath
made men in high places, to use towards the posterity of that noble
daring people:

“Be to her faults a little blind;

“Be to her virtues very kind.”

We have had democratic presidents: whig presidents; a pseudo democratic
whig president; and now it is time to have a president of
the [United States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#6857018469085917095); and
let the people of the
whole [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#11650227293356295462),
like the inflexible Romans, whenever they find a promise made by a
candidate, that is not practised as an officer, hurl the miserable
sycophant from his exaltation, as God did Nebuchadnezzar, to crop the
grass of the field, with a beast’s heart among the cattle.

[Mr. Van
Buren](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16327722444353915138) said
in his inaugural address, that he went “into the presidential chair the
inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt, on the part of
Congress, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, against the
wishes of the slave holding states; and also with a
determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with
it in the states where it exists.” Poor
little [Matty](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9716144089421288162) made
his rhapsodical sweep with the fact before his eyes, that the state
of [New-York](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#17150966989267803693),
his native state, had abolished slavery, without a struggle or a groan.
Great God, how independent\! From henceforth slavery is tolerated where
it exists: constitution or no constitution; people or no people; right
or wrong;
vox [Matti](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16294166102739918879);
vox Diaboli: “the voice
of [Matty](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#10952103746588905066)”—“the
voice of the devil;” and peradventure, his great “Sub-Treasury” scheme
was a piece of the same mind: but the man and his measures have such a
stricking \[striking\] resemblance to the anecdote of the Welchman and
his cart-tongue, that, when the constitution was so long that it allowed
slavery at the capitol of a free people, it could not be cut off; but
when it was so short that it needed a Sub-Treasury, to save the funds of
the [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#8761359257989743415),
it could be spliced\! Oh, granny, granny, what a long tail our puss has
got\! As a Greek might say, hysteron proteron: the cart before the
horse: but his mighty whisk through the great national fire, for the
presidential chesnuts, burnt the locks of his glory with the blaze of
his folly\!

(Now, finally, Jo gets to his own campaign promises after such a long
treatise on how great all the past presidents were… except for that fop,
Van Buren\!)

In the [United
States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#16791512047350074702) the
people are the government; and their united voice is the only sovereign
that should rule; the only power that should be obeyed; and the only
gentlemen that should be honored; at home and abroad; on the land and on
the sea: Wherefore, were I the president of
the [United States](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#1893141212058486724),
by the voice of a virtuous people, I would honor the old paths of
the venerated fathers of freedom: I would walk in the tracks of the
illustrious patriots, who carried the ark of the government upon their
shoulders with an eye single to the glory of the people: and when that
people petitioned to abolish slavery in the slave states, I would use
all honorable means to have their prayers granted: and give liberty to
the captive; by paying the southern gentleman a reasonable equivalent
for his property, that the
whole [nation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#3814145232058347844) might
be free indeed\! When the people petitioned for a national bank, I
would use my best endeavors to have their prayers answered, and
establish one on national principles to save taxes, and make them the
controllers of its ways and means; and when the people petitioned to
possess the teritory
of [Oregon](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#9262792889787948075) or
any other contiguous teritory; I would lend the influence of a chief
magistrate to grant so reasonable a request, that they might extend the
mighty eforts and enterprize of a free preople from the east to the west
sea; and make the wilderness blossom as the rose: and when a neighboring
realm petitioned \[p. 11\] to join
the [union](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#14224911010552433031) of
the sons of liberty, my voice would be, come: yea
come [Texas](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#6556308177971824929):
come [Mexico](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#6699824212731147090);
come [Canada](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#3621089400968934783);
and come all the world—let us be brethren: let us be one great family;
and let there be universal peace. Abolish the cruel custom of prisons,
(except certain cases,) penitentiaries, and court-martials for
desertion; and let reason and friendship reign over the ruins of
ignorance and barbarity; yea I would, as the universal friend of man,
open the prisons; open the eyes; open the ears and open the hearts of
all people, to behold and enjoy freedom, unadulterated freedom: and God,
who once cleansed the violence of the earth with a flood; whose Son laid
down his life for the salvation of all his father gave him out of the
world; and who has promised that he will come and purify the world again
with fire in the last days, should be supplicated by me for the good of
all people.

With the highest esteem, I am a friend of virtue, and of the people,

JOSEPH SMITH.

[Nauvoo](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/transcript/general-smiths-views-of-the-powers-and-policy-of-the-government-of-the-united-states-7-february-1844?print=true#11328068645049024710),
Illinois, February 7, 1844. \[p. 12\]

Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done. This was Jo’s
platform. This is what he wanted to accomplish as President of the
United States. What’s very interesting here is that in everything he
said, none of it was revolutionary. Nothing in this pamphlet actually
sets him apart from the other candidates other than this is merely a
synthesis of frequent campaign pamphlets contemporary with his time. He
did invoke God and Jesus more than Henry Clay, but otherwise this was
pretty standard. Now comes the question, does a campaign pamphlet like
this a serious presidential candidate make? No. Joseph Smith was never a
serious contender for the office, in spite of what he and his fellow
Mormon leaders thought. However, an important distinction needs to be
made here. Just because Jo wasn’t actually a viable candidate, that
doesn’t mean that he didn’t treat the issue like he wasn’t a viable
candidate. Jo had many goals in his life. He achieved many with
relatively few negative consequences. More power, more control, more
people looking to him as their leader; this was Jo’s gluttony. Because
the presidency was actually unattainable, that made Jo want it even
more, and he wasn’t one to give up on his deepest personal desires.
Truly, the forbidden fruit is the sweetest.
