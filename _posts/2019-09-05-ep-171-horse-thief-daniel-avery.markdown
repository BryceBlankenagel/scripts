Ep 171 – Horse Thief Daniel Avery

On this episode, we begin with discussing the arrest and extradition to
Missouri of Mormon horse-thief Daniel Avery. He suffers for 2 weeks in a
Missouri jail and is let off on a writ of habeas corpus to return to
Nauvoo and swear out an affidavit detailing what happened. The
Anti-Mormon political party becomes more aggressive in its opposition to
Mormon political power and the Nauvoo City Council responds with
enacting an ordinance which would allow them to arrest any officer of
the law attempting to arrest a Mormon and throw them in prison for life.
The Anti-Mormon party reacts in outrage and drafts their own resolution
to run any Mormons out of Carthage and Warsaw, as well as send a copy of
the new Nauvoo ordinance to the Governors of Missouri and Illinois. We
wrap the episode with briefly discussing last week’s episode and some
listener mail.

Now that our Council of Fifty series has concluded, it’s time to rewind
the podcast back to early 1844 to jump into our historical timeline.
From the feedback I received on the last episode, it’s become clear to
me that I need to address a few things and I’ll do so after the main
segment today.

Our timeline is just getting into 1844. We jumped ahead to talk about
the Council of Fifty because we’ll see events and factors play into its
foundation by the time we hit March of 1844 when it was actually
organized. The tendencies for creating a new theocratic government had
been present in Mormonism since its foundation, but never had reached
the fever pitch like in early 1844 where our timeline rests.

We’re going to take our time. 1844 is a woefully complex year of Joseph
Smith’s ministry, many would agree the most controversial and
complicated year of his entire life. We have a lot to discuss from
scandals and high-profile excommunications, to political maneuvers and
the looming threat of the Nauvoo Charter being revoked, to the King
Follett discourse, to the Nauvoo Expositor, to the rolling back of
polygamy and sex rings; we have a busy period ahead of us to cover the
rest of 1844 with the Council of Fifty cloud hanging over our heads.

Jo successfully evading the law in July and August of 1843 revealed how
criminally corrupt Nauvoo really was. The citizens of Illinois and
Missouri were becoming drained by the constant scandal and cover ups in
the kingdom, but one person exemplified the corruption that ran so deep
through the kingdom of God. This is the story of Daniel Avery, and his
son, Philander. These guys came into contact with a leading anti-Mormon
named Levi Williams, arrested them. Levi Williams is an important
anti-Mormon name to remember because he stood on trial for the
assassination of Joseph and Hyrum after the Carthage shootout. Daniel
Avery was a Mormon horse thief during the Missouri-Mormon war in 1838,
and had garnered a reputation of being a member of Jo’s secret cabal of
criminals. This is how Marvin Hill and Dallin Oaks wrote of Levi
Williams arresting the Averys in their book Carthage Conspiracy:

> If Thomas C. Sharp was the leading spokesman of the anti-Mormon cause,
> then Levi Williams was probably the leading actor. His activities made
> him well known to the Mormons. In December, 1843, Williams rode at the
> head of a mob that forcibly kidnapped a Mormon named Daniel Avery and
> his son at gunpoint near Warsaw, threatened them with knives, bound
> them in chains, and took them into Missouri, where they were briefly
> imprisoned on horse-stealing charges and then released.

So, what actually happened here when this leading anti-Mormon arrested
Daniel and Philander Avery? Levi Williams was a member of the Illinois
militia and, indeed, an anti-Mormon for understandable reasons. Most of
the citizens of the towns surrounding Nauvoo could be classified as
anti-Mormons by late 1843. But the crucial point here is reminiscent of
what happened with the Missouri State militia during the 1838
Missouri-Mormon war. Members of the state militia were citizens of the
state, which were the people impacted by the Mormons who harbored the
strongest grudges against them to begin with. It was impossible to
gather an impartial militia to execute the due process of law when the
militias were comprised of people who owned property the Mormons had
stolen or held a note against the Mormons that was 2 years overdue. It
was impossible for a militia and the commanding officers of said militia
to remain objective and impartial to the Mormon problem. The result of
Governor Boggs calling the militia out against the Mormons in 1838 was
everything getting dramatically blown out of proportion and the only
solution was to kick the Mormons out of the state. The Governor of
Illinois, Thomas Ford, knew this same problem hampered his abilities to
deal with the Nauvoo Mormon problem. If he called out the Illinois state
militia, they’d be just as mad at the Mormons as the Missouri militia
was in 1838 and armed conflict would be the inevitable result. Only the
Mormons in Nauvoo were far more terrifying than the Mormons in Missouri
because they had their own state-sanctioned militia, which was larger
than the Illinois state militia, and they were armed by Illinois state
armory. Even if Thomas Ford wanted to put down the Nauvoo Mormon problem
by militia force, the size of army he could call out would be
outnumbered and outgunned by the Mormons.

With these forces at play, Levi Williams acted of his own volition in
arresting Daniel and Philander Avery and took the initiative of
extraditing them to Missouri to answer for horse-theft, a charge which
didn’t infrequently result in hanging. Daniel and his son were released
and upon their return to Nauvoo from Missouri, Daniel made an affidavit,
which is included in the History of the Church vol 6. The whole ordeal
was labeled as kidnapping, but to be clear, Daniel Avery had an arrest
warrant in the state of Missouri, but there’s no evidence that a writ of
extradition was ever signed by Governor Thomas Ford of Illinois
authorizing Levi Williams to arrest the Averys in Illinois for
extradition to Missouri. So, technically it was sort of kidnapping, but
Daniel Avery was a fugitive from justice while residing in Illinois and
was likely carrying on his horse-theft practice while in Illinois and
was protected by the municipal government of Nauvoo from any
prosecution. One of the men in the arresting posse was a person from
whom Avery had stolen the horse; a guy named McCoy. Here’s a few
extracts from his affidavit issued on 28 December 1843 to Joseph Smith
himself:

Vogel HoC 6:162

> … Daniel Avery before me, Joseph Smith,… saith that… he was unlawfully
> arrested by force and arms, and kidnapped at Doty’s Mill… by Col. Levi
> Williams, his son John Williams,… John Elliot,… William Middleton, and

> They forced me into a skiff and bound me, and five men put me across…

Just to briefly comment before reading a few more excerpts. The last
thing Avery wanted was to be taken across the Mississippi to Missouri to
face old horse-theft charges. A Mormon in Missouri didn’t stand a chance
of getting a fair and balanced trial as we discussed earlier. However,
the last thing the posse wanted to do was remain in Illinois because the
Danites could have a search party out for Avery. The posse was in
control of the situation, but the fact that they traveled under the
cover of nightfall reveals that they knew, even if they had the proper
documentation, that they’d be used up by the Mormon mob in a second if
the Danites saw one of their brothers in the hands of Missourians. The
same principle governed the conduct of Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds when
they arrested Joseph Smith in Dixon and tried to get him to Missouri.
They took back roads and often traveled by night so the Danites couldn’t
find them and spring Jo free and leave the sheriffs for dead. They were
unsuccessful, but they escaped Nauvoo with their lives so luck was on
their side. This posse that arrested Daniel and Philander Avery knew
every minute they spent on the Illinois side of the Mississippi was
borrowed time against their lives. Understandably, Avery didn’t want to
be tried in Missouri, but maintained his innocence through this whole
ordeal the way any arrested person should. The posse got him across the
river that night and sent messengers to the Clark county seat, where the
trial was to be held against Daniel Avery. The sheriff came to see him
at the tavern where the posse stayed the remainder of the night.

Avery asked if he could be interred in the Monticello jail with his son,
but was denied. They removed him to the Palmyra jail where the
blacksmith “ironed me to the middle of a great chain that was fast to
the floor, where I remained in the horrid gloom of a Missouri prison two
weeks.”

To be chained to the floor of a dungeon for two weeks in December in
Missouri, if there’s a hell on earth that would be it, but all things
considered Avery got off pretty easy. People didn’t infrequently spend
their lives in dungeons like this. Hell, even Pistol Packin’ Porter
Rockwell spent months not only chained to the floor but with his right
wrist chained to his left ankle. This is basically corporal punishment
doled out over an extended period of time. This was torture, but, it was
better than the gallows that might await a convicted horse thief.

Daniel Avery had his initial indictment based on the affidavit given by
his son under duress.

I was informed that Middleton and McCoy procured an indictment against
me, by giving bonds to the amount of some two or three hundred dollars,
that they would hunt up testimony to the point for next court, there
being nothing against me but the affidavit of my son before alluded to,
and so the grand jury found a bill.

Ellison, my lawyer, deceived me, and put over my case for six months,
because, as I suppose, I being kidnapped had no fees for him. I objected
to having my trial put off six months; I did not fancy the dungeon of
Palmyra prison. The court concluded to let me to bail under bonds of
$1,000, but this I could not obtain: subsequently it was reduced to
$500, but all in vain, for I was unacquainted with the people.

Good thing America’s legal system has worked out all these injustices
and stuff like this never happens anymore. You know, stuff like plea
bargains signed under threat of harsher sentences, unreasonable bond for
nonviolent criminals who aren’t a travel risk with no means to pay them,
general mistreatment and lack of human decency provided to the prisoner.
Whew I’m glad we got past this stuff. Well, none of it really mattered,
because Daniel Avery spent the weekend in jail and on Monday he sued out
a writ of habeas corpus. Since the court only had Daniel’s son’s
affidavit and the accusation by McCoy of stealing the horse, they didn’t
have sufficient evidence to continue holding him in state custody and he
was released the next day. I will add that the end of his affidavit
sworn to Jo is quite interesting. Upon his return to Nauvoo on that
Tuesday afternoon, when he made his affidavit, he said “To those who
assisted your said affiant to obtain his release from bondage, he
tenders his grateful acknowledgements.”

He was just over the river from Warsaw. This whole ordeal, spanning 2.5
weeks, happened just 20 miles down the Mississippi from Nauvoo. He was
released Tuesday morning and made the journey on foot home and arrived
that same evening. Even though this happened in Missouri, it happened
just barely in Missouri, well within the confines of the jurisdiction of
the criminal empire. Not legally speaking because Nauvoo government had
no power outside the confines of the city, but well within the crime
family territory. So, who knows what really happened here, but Daniel
Avery initially had a bond of $1,000 put on his head, then the next day
he walks, possibly pointing to something beneath the surface that no
documentation would ever reveal.

This ordeal was branded as a kidnapping at the time and as you can see
from that passage I read from Marvin Hill’s and Dallin Oaks’ book, the
narrative persists to this day as propaganda often does. The guy who
made the arrest is infamous in Mormon history circles, Levi Williams.
Williams and Thomas Sharp are two of the most outspoken and prominent
anti-Mormons in all of Nauvoo history.

But what does that term mean, Anti-Mormonism? It’s a weaponized term
used to suffocate thought and stifle critical thinking today, but it
hasn’t always been this way.

Anti-Mormonism has been a near-constant presence in our timeline since
the church was founded. Whether it was the Ezra Booth letters or
Mormonism Unvailed, anti-Mormons have always filled the role of
necessary adversary to galvanize the Mormons against a common enemy.
Since their presence in Illinois following their expulsion from
Missouri, anti-Mormonism became a codified system of political power for
the sole purpose of opposing the overreach of Mormon political power.
The old citizens of Hancock and nearby counties in Illinois began the
Mormon refugee settlement era with sympathy. They felt pity for the poor
deluded religious fanatics. However, as Mormon power grew and the Nauvoo
Legion became an increasingly imposing force to be reckoned with,
anti-Mormonism grew in correlation.

Anti-Mormon is a divisive term. Today it means anybody who speaks out
against the church for any reason. It’s used as a demonization tactic,
and it’s incredibly effective. Sam Young, the guy trying to bring an end
to bishop’s worthiness interviews is considered an anti-Mormon. He tried
to make it so dentists and car salesman are no longer allowed to ask
teenagers about their masturbation habits, but alas, he spoke out
publicly against the church and held multiple public demonstrations
against bishop’s interviews and was excommunicated for it. Will you be
in Salt Lake City this upcoming October 5<sup>th</sup> for the next
march? Will I see you there? Information’s in the show notes. I’d love
to see you there.

Anti-Mormon can also mean anybody who tries to use the belief system of
the church to make their own church like Denver Snuffer, Chris Nemelka,
any Fundamentalist sect leader or any of the leaders of any other group
of Mormons outside the authority of the SLC headquartered church. All of
them are anti-Mormons according to the downtown SLC corporate entity.

Anti-Mormon can also mean people like yours truly who publish content
about Mormon history which falls outside the correlated narrative the
institution creates. Anti-Mormons like Kay Burningham sue the church for
fraud based on falsely representing their own history. Anti-Mormons
attend Sunstone Symposium and John Whitmer Historical Association and
present their research on church history and culture that sheds a
troubling light on controversial information. Some are excommunicated,
some ignored, some vilified. Each individual represents a unique case of
anti-Mormon.

My point is, the term anti-Mormon today has such an expansive definition
within the minds of believing folk and it’s used as a bludgeon to hide
information, quell insurrection, and shut down necessary societal
reforms. But it hasn’t always been this way.

Anti-Mormon during Joseph Smith’s lifetime had a more pointed definition
than today. An Anti-Mormon in the 1830s and 40s was a person who opposed
the church for any reason, but did so through active participation in
groups who opposed the church. A single person, like Eber Howe or John
C. Wreck-it Bennett, may be an anti-Mormon, but they were figureheads of
larger movements who opposed the growing power of Jo Smith and the
Mormons. Anti-Mormons were a codified group, not a label slapped on
anybody who doesn’t agree with the religious tenets.

Thomas C. Sharp was a well-known anti-Mormon out of Warsaw, Illinois; a
town about 20 miles south of Nauvoo along the Mississippi. His
attendance at the Nauvoo Temple cornerstone ceremony in 1841 engendered
feelings of absolute fear in his mind. He saw the Nauvoo Legion out in
full force with one thousand armed volunteers in full battle regalia.
Prominent politicians attended the parade; thousands of Mormons shouted
hosanna in the streets as the prophet spewed anti-American theocratic
dog whistles. Thomas Sharp could see this was a problem in its early
stages and the Mormon regime was a worthy cause to oppose. He formed the
anti-Mormon party in Warsaw which had vigorous support from nearby
Carthage; the old citizens of Illinois, just like the old citizens of
Missouri, had to do something to combat the growing threat.

They had reasons outside of the growing political threat to oppose the
Mormons. It turns out, the Mormons were bad neighbors.

You see, the anti-Mormon political party was working its best within the
confines of the law to roll back the ever-expanding power of the Mormon
political machine. We might view these things as a flame war before
twitter, but these meetings and resolutions had real effect and merited
real responses from the Nauvoo municipal government. There was, however,
a power imbalance when we compare the Mormon political party to the
Anti-Mormon. The Anti-Mormons could pass resolutions, but didn’t have
the binding power of a city charter which put the resolutions in place.
They were little more than sternly-worded letters. However, the city of
Nauvoo and its criminal empire could pass actual resolutions that were
recognized by the governor of Illinois as legally binding.

These meetings in late 1843 were held in response to Jo evading the law
once again when Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson arrested him and the Nauvoo
Municipal court released him on a writ of habeas corpus. The old
citizens of Illinois wanted Jo to answer for his crimes as they saw it
was the only reasonable way to curtail the expansive power of the Mormon
kingdom. You cut off the head of the demon and it dies, right? Little
did they know that this demon was actually a hydra, but they’d learn
that in less than a year.

These non-binding resolutions meant that the citizens of Carthage and
Warsaw were willing to call in the militias from Illinois and Missouri
to affect the long-awaited arrest of the tyrant. But, once again, these
are sternly worded letters declaring intent and desire, they weren’t
binding and had no real effect if Governors Ford and Reynolds of
Illinois and Missouri weren’t willing to go along. Regardless, a
response was required from the Nauvoo government with Jo chairing as
mayor of the city. They called a public meeting to pass a new resolution
on December 7, 1843. This meeting was called and the resolution passed
once the city had learned that Daniel Avery was arrested and taken to
Missouri. When the Nauvoo resolution talks about kidnapping, the Avery
situation is what it’s referring to. They were afraid a similar
“kidnapping” fate may befall other members of the church or even the
prophet himself and decided to make an actually binding resolution
preemptively to insulate church leadership.

I know that was kind of a long reading, but it’s important to capture
the mentality of the meeting during which this resolution was passed and
I did cut a fair amount to spare you undue boredom. That ordinance is
incredibly important though. The anti-Mormons could pass resolutions all
day but those didn’t actually amount to anything more than a wagged
finger and a printed outlet for their frustrations to be sent to
Governor Thomas Ford of Illinois.

The Mormons, on the other hand, had complete and total control of
Nauvoo. When they passed resolutions and ordinances, they had legal
effect, even if they were blatantly unconstitutional, like imprisoning
officers of the law for life for merely serving arrest warrants.

This new ordinance was published in the Nauvoo Neighbor of 13 December
1843 and was quickly circulated to nearby cities. The anti-Mormon
political party decided this was a step too far and chose to hold their
own meeting in the final days of December 1843, which was published in
the Warsaw Message of 3 January 1844. The Warsaw Message was what the
Warsaw Signal turned into when Thomas Sharp sold it, and it would revert
back to the Warsaw Signal when he took the helm of editing duties again
in February 1844.

Basically, the anti-Mormon political party knew this new Nauvoo
resolution had far-reaching and dire implications. It essentially made
anybody in Nauvoo completely immune from the criminal justice system.
This was a long-running trend in Nauvoo. A Jo crony would commit a
crime, he’d be arrested, then witnesses would be produced and Jo would
chair the municipal court hearing and they guy would be let off without
even a slap on the wrists. That’s how Nauvoo kept faithful members of
the church out of the criminal justice system of Illinois and Missouri
and it was effective and employed daily. Now, because of this new
resolution, there was yet another layer of protection for these
criminals. If a Mormon stole somebody’s property anywhere and a sheriff
or member of the Illinois or Missouri militia came into Nauvoo and
attempted to arrest the suspect, that sheriff of militiaman would
themselves be arrested and have to plead their case before the Nauvoo
municipal court. If, for any reason, their actions were seen as
unjustified by the Nauvoo Mormon leadership, that officer of the law
would be committed to the Nauvoo jail for a life sentence. This was
understandably terrifying for anybody on the receiving end of these
draconian mafia laws.

Accordingly, the citizens of Warsaw and Carthage decided to take
measures to simply keep the Mormons out of their towns. The power
granted by this resolution extended beyond the confines of Nauvoo. If a
Mormon committed a crime in Warsaw and Carthage, like stealing a man’s
horse, and that Mormon was arrested, the Nauvoo Legion could march into
the town, storm the jail where the Mormon was confined, and put him and
the arresting officer in their custody and bring them to Nauvoo for a
hearing, which could result in the arresting officer being thrown in
jail for life. The rest of the points in this resolution made it so
Mormons seen in Carthage and Warsaw would be removed by the citizens.

The Mormons had a ton of power and the anti-Mormons acted reactively to
attempt some kind of mitigation of said power, even if that meant they
simply chased any Mormons out of their towns by calling them spies or
bad characters. Mormonism was the one infringing on people’s rights and
an opposing force was necessary to restore and maintain those rights.
That’s the overall point here, anti-Mormonism is purely reactionary. It
exists because Mormonism is a force of nature to be dealt with somehow.
That’s just as true of the 1840s to combat Jo’s criminal regime as it is
today’s anti-Mormons combatting the Salt Lake City criminal regime. A
tax-exempt organization that takes and takes and takes from the world
community while giving nothing back, while making billions of dollars a
year in shadow money with no transparency, covering up sex abuse and
trafficking, holding to doctrines of religious, sexual, and racial
supremacy, all while never admitting fault or apologizing for bigotry,
inciting hatred, and committing genocide and waging political warfare on
the world stage where it doesn’t belong; the modern church is guilty of
far greater atrocities than Joseph Smith ever committed.

Anti-Mormonism wouldn’t exist if Mormonism didn’t do things worth
opposing. Mormonism is the aggressor in this equation, both in Joseph
Smith’s ministry and the modern church. Mormonism itself is the problem
and the blatantly immoral way in which the leadership conducts the
church’s activities and direction is what creates anti-Mormonism.
Anti-Mormon isn’t anti-Mormons. The vast majority of Mormons are great
people, they’re my family and friends. MormonISM is the problem here and
what anti-Mormon people oppose. It’s the religion that’s the problem,
not the people sitting in the pews.

Maybe one day, Mormonism will stop infringing on the rights of people
and common decency and anti-Mormonism will be obsolete. Maybe one day
anti-Mormonism will no longer have to fight FOR equal rights and AGAINST
religious and racial supremacy. Maybe anti-Mormonism will have the wind
taken out of its sails because Mormonism no longer tells LGBTQ people
they’re less than human or aren’t normal. Maybe anti-Mormons won’t have
to rely on leaks to see face of the financial demon hiding behind the
granite edifices with no accountability. Maybe one day Mormonism will
give 10% of its billions to charity like it requires of all its members
and a whole renaissance of new hospitals, schools, low-income housing,
and public works projects will spring up all over the planet. Maybe one
day Mormonism will help secular authorities prosecute rapists in the
leadership instead of comforting them by draping the shroud of
Kirton-McConkie’s legal safety blanket over their shoulders and telling
them everything will be fine if you just keep your mouth shut and let us
handle it. Until then, if somebody calls you an anti-Mormon, maybe,
instead of treating it as a slight, it’s time to consider that a badge
of honor.

C segment

I wanted to address last week’s show about the Council of Fifty. If you
didn’t catch it or this is your first episode, it was an alternative
history. We’ve done alternate history twice in this podcast before. The
first time was the interview with Mark Hoffman, the second was the
History of Liverpool by Jonas Pierce back on episode 127. I still get
emails about that episode from people who thought it was real. Look at
the release date and google Samhain. It’s a Gaelic tradition when the
divisions between the natural and supernatural are thinnest and it’s
celebrated by storytelling; Samhain is what Halloween is based on.

I’ve long pondered what American history would look like if Joseph Smith
didn’t die in Carthage and lived long enough to see his wildest dreams
come true. What if he’d escaped Carthage? What if Congress granted him
his request for 100,000 soldiers to march across the country and conquer
the remaining wilderness? What if he was elected president? A few people
have reached out in the past and ask if an alternate history like this
exists or what my version might look like. I’m not aware of any
alternate history with Joseph surviving Carthage, although I’m sure a
few are out there. As for my own version of Joseph Smith’s alternate
history, it’s so dependent on so many variables that nearly any version
of alternative history can be imagined. The version I constructed in
last week’s show is completely impossible, but that’s the joy of
historical fiction, it can be whatever we want it to be.

I chose to construct a version of American history that experienced
Joseph Smith’s wildest dreams coming true. I disagreed with Historian D.
Michael Quinn about his high-level assessment of the Council of Fifty
because I felt he based his judgement on its result more than its
intention. The alternative history I created was based solely on the
intention of the Council of Fifty and if it were actually used the way
Jo had intended it from its inception. Besides, what do you expect the
Utah years of this podcast to look like?

That leaves a few interesting questions up for speculation. How far were
we realistically away from that version of history happening? To what
degree did it not happen through bad lawmaking and sheer incompetence
alone? How far are we from it today? Jo had grand plans he was often
terrible at executing, but what if he had the Midas touch and his career
turned out how he wanted? What would an American Mormon theocracy look
like? What would the system of Moronite law look like? Would
non-believers have a place to exist under such a system? What modern
systems of theocracy closely resemble what could be expected of an
American Mormon theocracy?

Today’s episode was an illustration of the necessity of anti-Mormonism.
On a personal level, I vehemently oppose Mormon political power. I
oppose all religion, but Mormonism particularly is the single wealthiest
religion in America and is vastly overrepresented by sheer number of
Mormon politicians with respect to the non-Mormon population. Today we
run a pretty low risk of America devolving into a Moronite law Mormon
theocracy, but people living in 1844 watching Jo run for president
didn’t have the luxury of historical hindsight we enjoy today. The
idea of a Mormon theocracy was a far more prescient and realistic threat
to them in the 1840s than it is to us today.

Painting a picture of history requires capturing the mindset of the
people who lived through it. Not only did I include quotes from
contemporaries, but I did my best to put myself in the mindset of myself
living in a dystopian Mormon theocratic future. This was revealed
through subtle hints throughout the episode referencing the limited
information we have and not being able to trust information before the
last few minutes where I talked about my families, the Nauvoo Legion in
present terms, and the division of the three kingdoms of what used to be
the United States and all of that. That’s why I tried to use the terms
“Lamanites” and “Descendants of Cain” outside of reading quotes
because in an alternate reality indigenous people and African-Americans
today could be referred to by those terms.

Most importantly, the episode was an exercise in the importance of
context. Every time I said quote on the episode, those were real quotes;
almost exclusively quotes I’ve read on the show before in their proper
historical context. Think back and try to remember; when did it hit you
that the show was a fabrication? Was it when I talked about the
publishers of the Nauvoo Expositor being thrown in labor camps? How
about when Rigdon campaigned and collected signatures to speak before
Congress to pass the 100,000 soldiers bill? Maybe when it passed June
1844 and Jo wasn’t in Carthage Jail and certainly didn’t die? Was it as
late as when Jo was actually elected president? How about when the South
seceded in 1845 instead of 1860?

That disharmony or cognitive dissonance hitting your brain happened
because you have a passing familiarity with American and Mormon history
so you could detect the forgery. To someone who knows nothing of either
subject, it could be mostly plausible, or at least tough to tell what
was real and not. But upon critical examination it was so clearly
fiction. The characters were one-dimensional. Crucial details were
lacking. The military campaigns were quickly done away with in a
paragraph or two when military history is arguably one of the most
fascination subfields of history BECAUSE it’s so complex. All the Native
American tribes were just fish in a barrel when, in reality, colonialism
was far messier and more disturbing than what I described. Frankly, a
lot of it read like the Book of Mormon with the nearly invincible Nauvoo
Legion and overwhelming military victories with minimal casualties and
Bloody Brigham and Lyman Wight holding their posts perfectly, millions
of people resettling in new locations, entire cities burned to the
ground with no mercy. Those are all points of historical context and
that’s one of the main points I wanted to get across in making the
episode.

History without context means nothing. That’s how apologetics work.
Apologetics come from all angles. Believers claim that exMormons or
anti-Mormons take quotes out of context to build a case that the church
is false and exMormons claim that believers refuse to understand
historical context because it would inevitably destroy their testimony.
Context cuts all directions and it’s important to recognize that.
Whether it’s FAIRMormon or the CES letter, those are by no means
equivalent (don’t mistake the point I’m making here), both resources
lack perspective and context. From the beginning, I’ve tried my best to
give you that all-important historical context in this podcast.

I used this historical fiction to paint a portrait of Mormon beliefs,
because what I described were the blueprints to its foundation. Because
Jo was a hopeless failure at many things he tried to accomplish, the
episode was historical fiction. But the analogy I made still holds. If a
guy kills somebody that’s horrible. If a guy attempts to kill somebody
but is thwarted by either intervention from outside forces or his own
incompetence, the intent is the same. Last episode was a historical
fiction built squarely on the intent of the religion from its inception.
We have plenty of grounds to judge Joseph Smith’s Mormonism based on
what it accomplished but I would argue it’s far more important to judge
it on the grounds of what he envisioned that it could become. We can’t
prove a person’s intent when they’ve been dead for over a century and a
half, but we can make informed speculation based on their actions.

I’ve called Jo evil on this show before and that’s admittedly too
simplistic. The reality is, Jo was a complex guy who challenged
everything. He pushed every social construct to the point of breaking
and then kept pushing. He was unrelenting in his aspirations but too
impotent or lazy to bring them to reality and the world is better for
it.

So, when I’m tagged in social media threads of somebody trying to
understand the “real” reason Jo was shot in Carthage, all I can think of
is how did he survive for so long with tens of thousands wanting him
dead for the majority of his career? You want to know the real reason
Joseph Smith was assassinated, how long ya got? Because we’re going to
be talking about this for hours before you have a solid contextual
foundation for what happened that day in Carthage.

If there’s one lesson to take away from 171 episodes of this show, it’s
that context is everything.
