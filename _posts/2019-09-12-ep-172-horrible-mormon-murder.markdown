Ep 172 – HORRIBLE MORMON MURDER

On this episode, we tap into over a dozen news articles to get a finger
on the pulse of 1844 America when it came to the Mormons. People across
the nation loved to read headlines about the Mormons and papers with
those headlines sold like hotcakes. Newspapers ramped up the headlines
to sell more copies, which, in turn, made everybody even more frenzied
about the deluded religious fanatics that were going to take over the
country. A new scandal breaks and Jo deflects everybody’s attention by
calling out John C. Calhoun on his complacency toward the plight of the
Mormons.

By early January 1844, the Mormons were in a state of political flux. Jo
had yet to declare himself candidate for president but it was at the
forefront of his mind. Like any senator who doesn’t run for reelection
because next year is the Presidential election, but still waits to
formally declare their candidacy, that’s where Joseph Smith was in the
first month of 1844.

Like any presidential candidate, Jo wanted to make his debut on the
public stage with reasons. He had White-Out Willard Richards draft his
campaign platform while Jo set about writing letters and reading various
articles from papers around the nation that were written about the
Mormons.

Yes, Mormons were the talk of the nation. Unfortunately, the History of
the Church wasn’t kind enough to print each of those articles for us to
see, it merely references them. So, I decided to do a little digging
myself on a few newspaper archive sites.

Just a brief digression before reading these. Today’s show really
illustrates how the internet has fundamentally shifted the social
science of history. Until very recently, and I mean extremely recently,
within the last 10 years, access to hundreds of thousands of newspapers
would have required a person’s entire life of travelling to various
local historical societies and reading each edition of each paper
individually. I’ve collected a dozen stories about the Mormons and it
took me a couple days of searching and reading. For a historian to
collect all of these 10 years ago would have been weeks of travelling,
making phone calls to archivists, reading faxed copies, throwing away
most of them because they aren’t relevant, and weeks or months beyond
that to verify an actual holograph copy of these to ensure accuracy of
transcripts. Today, I can do a search of multiple databases of indexed
newspapers with high-resolution scans of the originals, and find exactly
what I’m looking for among so many other gems.

With that in mind, I did my best to find a representative set of
articles here. You may hear the general tone of the majority of these is
either negative or benign towards the Mormons, but the fact of the
matter is, the media generally didn’t like the Mormons, which fed the
hungry readers who wanted to hear about the latest happenings in the
Mormon Empire. This only shaped people’s prejudice even more, which, in
turn, made them even more excited to buy the next issue of the paper
that reported on the next Mormon scandal. It was a feedback loop that
shaped the minds of Americans and the Americans who bought the papers
shaped the articles with their purchasing power. Very little of this
feedback loop was supportive of Jo and the Mormons. Even outlets that
were largely sympathetic to the Mormons were printing and reprinting
articles about troubling aspects of how the city was being run, often
with large excerpts from the Times and Seasons or the Nauvoo Neighbor,
the Mormon periodicals. But the truth is, Nauvoo Mormonism in 1843 and
44 didn’t do much that was viewed as good. What happened that the
national media could report positively on? New businesses cropping up?
New buildings being dedicated? “New brick foundry built by the Mormons”
doesn’t sell papers. “Horrible Mormon Murder,” “General Joseph Smith’s
Special Privileges,” “Mormon Massacre”; those headlines sell paper
subscriptions. The point is, the Mormons and Joseph Smith specifically
didn’t really do anything headline-worthy that was good.

This feedback loop of media feeding the public apocalyptic narratives
and the public feeding the media through clicks and subscriptions, it’s
nothing new, it’s always existed, and anybody who says it started in
recent memory or in their lifetime should have their perception checked
because this ouroboros has existed a long time. These feedback loops
have real-world impact as well. The public went crazy over the latest
Mormon scandal, the Mormons reacted by deflecting or manufacturing
another scandal which kept the people whipped up and talking about the
Mormons until the next scandal broke and city resolutions were passed in
Nauvoo as a response. Then the public outrage begins over the latest
resolution or ordinance and the whole cycle repeated at the next
heightened level of chaos. This is fuel to a persecution narrative. The
outrage machine only benefits those who drive it.

So, with that out of the way, let’s see what the national media was
saying about the Mormons. I’ve transcribed a bunch in no particular
order and I’ll comment as we go along.

Using Mormons as an example of how crazy folk can be:

Mel Johnson, who wrote Lyman Wight’s biography, couldn’t corroborate
this and this isn’t something that would slip under the radar of Mormon
historians, so it’s most likely fake news.

With only 2 exceptions, these are all headlines from just the three
weeks of December 23 1843 to January 6 1844. Simply put, the Mormons
were the talk of the nation and any headline with Mormon or Joe Smith in
it quickly sold. People also knew that Jo was going to be running for
president because he’d put himself in the public position for the past 4
years he’d been building his kingdom on the Mississippi. It was the
perfect time for another Mormon scandal to make its way into the public
consciousness.

New York Daily Herald, picked up from England papers from a month prior.

> HORRIBLE MORMON MURDER.—A horrible occurrence took place at, Keeve,
> Cheshire (where there are a great many Mormons) on the 23d November
> last. The priest of the order is a blacksmith, of the name of
> Cartwright, and among the devotees is a fanatic of the name of
> Pugmire, also a smith or engineer. The latter was married to a
> respectable woman of about thirty years of age, who had borne him
> three children, and was within three months of her next confinement.
> She had steadily refused to adopt the fanatical opinions of her
> husband, and much altercation had ensued in consequence. Worn out,
> however, with his repeated solicitations, and his continued
> declarations that unless she submitted to be baptized into the order,
> she would be eternally lost, she declared her intention to one of her
> neighbors to obey her husband’s wishes, being satisfied, as she said,
> that unless she did so she would never have any more peace with him.
> On Thursday, the 23d ult., at eight o’clock at night, the poor,
> worn-out creature was taken by her husband and the blacksmith priest
> down to the river below the works, was denuded of all her clothing
> except a small flannel singlet, and, notwithstanding her interesting

> plunged her into the stream. The night was dreadfully cold and dark,
> and, in consequence of the late heavy rains, the river was running at

> hold of her naked arm, unfortunately let go his grasp, and the current
> running like a mill race, immediately carried her away, and it being
> pitch dark, she was instantly overwhelmed by the boiling flood and
> drowned. The husband walked home with the greatest deliberation and

> adding “that it was the wickedness of her faith that caused it, but
> that he was now satisfied that she was in glory.” That body was

How was this scandal handled? Like every other scandal in Joseph Smith’s
history, deflection. John C. Wreck-it Bennett is publishing exposes
about polygamy? Look at how much we were persecuted by Missouri\! The
Prophet is the chief suspect in the assassination attempt of a former
Governor? Have you seen our collection of mummies and papyri? Oh, a
pregnant woman died getting baptized into our church? Look at how much
of a dick that slave-driver John C. Calhoun is\!

Jo’s reply is perfectly expected. He used fiery language and emotive
arguments to destroy Calhoun’s political character. It’s a long read but
it’s very entertaining.

It’s important to understand the mentality of the Mormons and the
religious leaders at this time. The Mormons had suffered a lot in the
nearly 14 years they’d been a religion. From mobs chasing them from town
to town and destroying their property, to multiple arrests of the
prophet and high-ranking church leaders, to lawsuits, to the more overt
perceived persecution in Missouri. In Missouri the Mormons had come
against their most powerful enemies to that point, supremacist
Missourians. The Missourians didn’t like the Mormons, the Mormons didn’t
like the Missourians, the Missourians killed a bunch of Mormons, the
Mormons killed a few Missourians, and then the Missourians won because
the Mormons were violently removed from the state. That horrible time
for the Mormons in Missouri was a bottomless well to draw from in order
to reinforce the Mormon persecution complex.

And that’s the underlying trend in all of these incidents, the Mormon
persecution complex. You simply can’t be a powerful religious leader if
you don’t have an enemy to galvanize your people against. For most
American religions at this time, those threats were ethereal, Satan, the
powers of evil ruling the world. But a person can only fight an unseen
force by using their own unseen forces of prayer and piety. This
narrative works for most religions, but others need a more temporal and
tangible enemy. Small religions, in particular, thrive on having a
common enemy. Instead of Satan being the enemy, it’s Satanists or
atheists. Instead of the family being torn apart, it’s the gays that are
tearing families apart. Instead of the forces of darkness ruling the
unenlightened world, it’s communist Russian that’s going to take over,
unless they helped your favorite candidate get elected then we’re
totally cool with Russia again.

Having a common enemy is one of the constituent pieces to a successful
religion. That piece is integral. That “otherizing” is required for a
religious group to work. You have to have an evil “them” to have a
chosen “us”. Far from mitigating these human tendencies, Joseph Smith
capitalized on them. He stoked the flames of religious supremacy in his
group and inferiority of the rest of the world. He exacerbated the
problem because it benefitted him and made his followers more devout.

But where does this end? You begin to vilify anybody who doesn’t like
your religion, you eventually arrive at a point where you have to vilify
anybody who isn’t a member of your religion; those who aren’t possible
investigators anyway. Eventually, any person who speaks ill of your
religion, even from the inside, is a traitor, a heretic, an apostate.
Then anybody they talk to are colluding with the apostates and can never
be forgiven for their treason. Then the whole world is evil and only
your religion is acceptable and all other religions are evil
abominations. All news reports that are favorable are to be enjoyed,
anything in opposition is slanderous fake news. Eventually the
government is trying at every turn to destroy your religion and if not
for the free exercise of religion the government would march into your
religious town and massacre every single member of the “us”. It’s not a
slippery slope fallacy if the slippery slope is real and this is exactly
what happened with the Mormons and the rest of the world in the
19<sup>th</sup> century.

This results in a big question. Was the persecution narrative calculated
or sincerely believed? Humans are programmed for efficiency and rarely
consider their own beliefs through a skeptical lens because it takes
mental resources. I believe Jo floated out the persecution narrative in
New York because he genuinely believed he was being persecuted, even if
the primary “persecutors” were his friends and fellow magicians just 3
years before the religion began. The persecution narrative worked then
and I think he simply ran with it and never questioned whether or not it
was a good idea. As a religious leader, he spewed from the pulpit
supremacist ideas and the followers grew, the tithing income increased,
and people began to swear their lives to the cause. It’s very organic
and needn’t an explanation in malice.

It was incredibly effective. Tap into the Mormons’ collectively shared
trauma anytime the will of the prophet is opposed by anything or
anybody, including the due process of law, and instantly the majority of
Jo’s sycophants are goose-stepping in line behind their supreme leader.
What couldn’t be accomplished with 15,000 who were willing to die for
their beliefs? What couldn’t be accomplished with 7 million who are
willing to follow the prophet through thick and thin without asking
questions? The same persecution narrative that was organically crafted
by the founder of the church survives and thrives today. The escalation
we see in the 1840s never ratcheted down; the heat on this boiling pot
of religious persecution was never turned down. Rational actors and
critical voices have no place inside the persecution narrative. Any
effort to diffuse the situation results in the person who feels
persecuted thinking they’re being persecuted even more. Persecution is
used by leaders to control members and those same leaders have been
hearing the narrative their whole lives so of course they perpetuate it.

The more this happens, the more civil discourse dies. We have ex-mormons
screaming at apologists about historicity and anachronisms. We have
apologists screaming at ex-Mormons supposedly committing crimes when
they write CESletter.org on the cover page of the Book of Mormon when
they stay at a Marriot. It only escalates. Escalation in this
irrationality fosters anger, hatred, and frustration in the minds of all
those who participate and this escalation has its roots in the very
foundation of the church. The worst part of this escalation is its
causal relationship otherizing. We’re locked in a race of Mutually
Assured Dehumanization and that’s a trend which pervades every single
aspect of our culture and day-to-day life. So, when an apologist writes
a blog post that’s flippant in its generalizations or an exmormon says
that Mormonism is a cult, don’t buy into the MAD doctrine of Mormonism.
PSA from yours truly here: we all commit logical fallacies, we all see
our interlocutors as idiots, we’re all quick to champion somebody on our
side and dehumanize somebody on the other, we all wait with bated breath
for the next smackdown or gotcha, but none of these things are good.
Because guess what, we’re all humans. We’re all working with the same
equipment here. We all have stuff going on in our lives that we take joy
from or is stressing us out. We all have things and people we love and
hate. All our brains operate in fundamentally the same way just with
different information. The more we play into this Mutually Assured
Dehumanization, the more we fall into the same patterns that exiled
Brigham Young’s Mormons to Mexico where they committed genocide with
impunity. We can never learn from history if we keep repeating the
patterns that caused it to be the way it is. I applaud people who post
thoughtful articles or blogs that are meaningful and thought provoking,
believer or not, but for every one of those there are 15 slams from one
side against the other. This escalation only drives us all closer to
MADness.
