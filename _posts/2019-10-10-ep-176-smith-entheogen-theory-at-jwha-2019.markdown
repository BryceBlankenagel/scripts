Ep 176 – Smith-entheogen Theory at JWHA 2019

On this episode, we air a presentation given for the John Whitmer
Historical Association conference on psychedelics in early Mormonism. If
my inbox is any indicator, many of you have been waiting on the newest
research related to the Smith-entheogen theory; the wait is over. This
presentation focuses specifically on the likely presence of the
nightshade family of plants in Mormonism within the
19<sup>th</sup>-century medicinal and occult context. If this
presentation isn’t enough, consider listening to the Patreon-exclusive
edition which is nearly 3 hours’ worth of extended research used to
create the presentation, along with a few stories from the conference
itself and some audience reactions. That’s my way of saying ‘thank
you\!’ to our financial supporters who made this research and
attending the JWHA conference possible\! Next week we’ll jump back into
our historical timeline.

What you’re about to listen to is a presentation on the Smith-entheogen
theory I recently gave at John Whitmer Historical Association conference
in Fairport, New York. My co-presenter, Brian Kassenbrock presented on
Hermetic influences in the Burned-over district and the Book of Mormon,
which constitutes the first roughly 18 minutes of the presentation.
After that, I take the stand and present the most recent developments in
my research on psychedelics in early Mormonism. I was unable to attain
permissions to video the presentation as it required releases from all
in attendance should they be seen on the video; however, John Whitmer
Historical Association was kind enough to give me permission to air the
audio of the presentation here on the podcast.

If you’re hearing this on the regular feed, you’ll get the entire
presentation as well as a few final remarks about how the presentation
was received. However, because I was able to make the trip and conduct
all the underlying research thanks to my fantastic supporters on
patreon.com/nakedmormonism, I want to do a little something extra for
those supporters. If you’re hearing this on the patreon feed, it’s about
twice the length, and here’s why:

I put a lot of research and work into this presentation and the strict
time limit necessarily required a lot of culling away important
information. I want all that information on the patreon broadcast in
order to further contextualize the information within the presentation.
I want to piece together a more holistic presentation of the evidence
for the Smith-entheogen theory and my way of saying thank you for
supporting the show is by aggressively expanding this broadcast to the
presentation I would have given if I had the entire hour block to give
it.

Quick heads up for both the patreon and the regular feed listeners,
during the Q\&A portion of the presentation, the audience wasn’t
provided with a microphone. I’ve done my best to work with the audio
provided but it might be tough for some of you audiophiles to hear
because the audio isn’t perfect.

After the presentation I’ll cut back in with a few additional notes as
well as some of the reactions of attendees after the presentation was
given. If you’re dying to hear the newest research on psychedelics in
early Mormonism, like my inbox reveals, today is the day for that
update.

So, without further ado, here’s one small aspect of the Smith-entheogen
theory in its most updated form. And, of course, I want to thank John
Whitmer Historical Association, especially the past-president Rachel
Killebrew, as well as Jason Smith for giving permissions and providing
the audio respectively.

T+6:21:

Hey patrons, let’s take a minute to discuss this point. I put a bit of
research into collecting modern trip reports from people but the strict
time limit of the presentation didn’t allow for further exploration,
instead only allowing for brief allusions to what I’ve found. Here are a
few reports from people who specifically used Datura, which you’ll soon
learn is the central focus of the presentation. These trip reports are
mostly anonymous and self-reported, but the nature of studying these
illegal plant medicines requires these limitations. These two trip
reports are kind of long, but I want you to vicariously experience what
a Datura trip is like through the eyes of these experienced users.

This trip report is titled Discovering Delerium by Jason Goyer, likely a
pseudonym:

> We carefully counted out 75 seeds for each of us and ate them as they
> were. This was followed by another period of waiting that lasted for
> another hour. Once again the concencus was that there was no noticable
> effect. This prompted the eating of 75 more seeds, bringing the total
> to 150.  
>   
> At this point we decided to walk to a mutual friends house, and share
> some of the seeds we had with him. It was on the walk that the Datura
> started to show effects. I felt a bit warmer than usual, and I was
> having light hot flashes that travled up my body from feet to head. (I
> later found that this may be caused by the vasculardialating
> properties of the Atropine) I didn't have any trouble thinking, and my
> motor skills were unaffected.  
>   
> As time progressed the effects became more intense, and I noticed that
> I had stopped sweating and my mouth was quite dry. I felt as though I
> should be sweating from the heat radiating off my body, and I queryed
> my partner as to whether he felt the same. He confirmed that he did,
> and he also suggested that we find some shade and rest a bit. We
> stopped at a 7-11 store, and checked the time for records sake and saw
> it was 1:30pm. It was when we stopped that I noticed my heartrate was
> well above normal. I took my pulse and got it at around 120bpm. We got
> some large drinks, and sat in the store drinking, and wondering if it
> was such a good idea to be out in the heat. The temperature outside
> was reaching close to the 100 degree mark.  
>   
> After a 20 minute rest at the 7-11 we started off again to our
> destination. In only 10 minutes of walking I started to feel the
> beginning effects of heat stroke, and so did my friend, so we once
> again had to stop and rest. The total period of time we layed in the
> shade is unknown to me. When we felt that it was safe to continue, we
> walked the rest of the way. Although it was less than a quarter mile,
> we felt as if we had walked across the Sudan. The effects had not
> intensified much more with the exception of the dry mouth. It was as
> if every last drop of water had been sucked from my body (which it
> had). It hurt to swallow, and I was in desperate need of some water.  
>   
> We got into our friends house at just 2:05pm, and rehydrated
> ourselves. We counted out 150 seeds for our friend and took 100 more
> ourselves. The same effects we had expirenced before got a bit more
> intense as time slipped by, and I noticed a definate dialation of my
> pupils. I also had trouble reading small print, or seeing smaller
> objects any distance. The waves of heat were pulsing through my body
> at a comfortable rate, and they made me feel at peace with myself. My
> friend and I had both assumed layed out positions on our back and were
> resting well.  
>   
> At around 2:45, I consumed 50 more seeds (no one else took any more).
> The same effects continued for a good three hours, and I still noticed
> no change in mindset or motor control. However, at around 6:00pm I
> started to have problems with my fine motor control. I found it
> difficult to move my fingers, and pick up small objects. My eyesight
> had become a bit worse, and I definitely started to notice a major
> change in perception. In particular there was a nail sticking out of
> the wall in the room that seemed to be moving through the grain up and
> down, then side to side. This only lasted for 2 minutes or so, however
> the naps of the carpet began to twich furiously. At this point I began
> having to use the restroom constantly, this being the diaretic
> properties of the datura. I couldn't keep much water in my body, so I
> resorted to drinking gatorade.  
>   
> I don't have much memory of waiting for the sun to go down, but I do
> remember waiting for that to happen. The next clear memory I have is
> looking out the window and seeing that the sun was down. My state of
> mind had obviously moved towards a lack of judgment because I decided
> it was safe to walk home. The time of my departure from my friends was
> around 9:00pm. I was no longer feeling the body high, either I had
> become used to it, or it had just gone away. My heart was racing at an
> ungodly rate, but I didn't notice unless I specificaly checked. When I
> reached about a quarter of the way home I began to talk to my friend
> who had been with me earlier in the morning as I walked. We were
> having an indepth conversation on a topic which I can not remember,
> when he suddenly veered off and layed down in a patch of grass. This
> alarmed me because I knew that Datura may have sever adverse effects
> on the body causing coma and or death. I started walking to over to
> him so that I might get him up or carry him to the nearest place we
> could get help when he just disappeared. I must have looked and yelled
> around for him for about 30 minutes. I finally gave up and decided it
> was best to head to my house.  
>   
> It was then that I started to notice flashes of light in the
> periphrieals of my vision. I looked around to discover the source of
> the flashes and could not find one, so I continued walking. I saw a
> large white puffy object that resembled a mushroom of some variety I
> had never seen. When I approached it, it was very large. The top had a
> diameter of about 4 inches, and it had a very stubby stock. This,
> however was not what caused me to walk over. It was the flashes of
> light inside the cap that interested me. It looked almost like a video
> of neurons firing in someones brain. It was very real to me, I could
> touch it. It was not untill much later that I even realized that I had
> been hallucinating. Everything was real to me. I had no more
> hallucinations on the way to my house. I did however start to have
> major motor control problems. My hands were almost twiching out of
> control, and it felt as though my knees were going to give out at
> times. I began to worry, and almost panicked at the fact that my knees
> were coming out from under me. It took all the concentration I had
> just to keep walking. At this point I felt that if I had fallen I
> would not have been able to get back up. However I did make it safely
> back to my house.  
>   
> Upon arrival at my home I immediatly checked the time, and was
> flabbergasted to see it was 11:20pm. A walk that usually takes no
> longer than 20 minutes took me over two hours. I forgot about the time
> when my stomache rumbled loudly and quickly went to make myself a nice
> cool bowl of cereal. As I was making my cereal I remember listening to
> an episode of Drew Carey on the TV. It was the April fools episode
> with all the pop-ups like from Pop-up video. The show was coming to an
> end as I walked into the livingroom and sat down to eat. I ate several
> spoon fulls of cereal and looked up to see what was comming on next.
> The TV was not even on. It was at this point that I finally made a
> separation, and realized that I had been hallucinating. I finished
> eating quickly, took a long cold shower, and went to bed.  
>   
> Now as for lasting effects, the only one that plauged me was the fact
> that my pupils remained completely dialated for a week, and I could
> not read any small print, or street signs from a distance. As for my
> friend who went to sleep in the grass, I called his house to see if he
> had made it home, and he answered the phone. The first words out of my
> mouth were, 'Oh good you made it back, you have no idea how relived I
> am about that.' His reply stunned me, as it still does every time I
> think about it.... 'I never left the house last night.' We argued for
> a long time, because in my mind it really happened. He was there, he
> layed down. And then I couldn't find him. But It was confirmed by the
> people who live there, that he never left the house with me that
> night.  
>   
> I will never do Datura again. It is definitely not a recreational
> psychedelic. In fact it is not a psychedelic at all, it causes your
> body to go into a near death delerium, by raising your body
> temperature to dangerously high levels, Raising your heartrate to
> equally high levels, and drying every moisture producing gland in your
> body. I found it to be dangerous, and very un-spiritual. They are real
> hallucinations, meaning that you can not tell the difference between a
> hallucination and whats real. I do not recommend that anyone ever try

This account, anonymously published in 2000 by a male user, is
remarkable and entirely consistent with many others I found. We
typically understand hallucinations from psychedelics to be flashes of
light, blurred vision, and tracers at low dosages, then increasing to
fractal patterns, movement of static objects at mid-range doses, and
ending in pure whiteness and complete dissolution of any real images at
high doses. Nightshade hallucinations are completely different. The user
sees things which aren’t there and completely mistakes them for reality.
Hallucinations from acid or psilocybin are clearly seen as
hallucinations, the user understands that what they see isn’t real and
usually recall that they’re tripping, but that’s not how nightshades
work.

Nightshades contain three psychoactive alkaloids, 2 of which are used in
medicine today. Atropine, commonly used as an anesthetic, and
scopolamine, commonly used to reduce the symptoms of sea-sickness, and
hyoscyamine, which I’m not aware of any medicinal uses. These three in
combination work on similar receptors to completely alter how the person
experiences the world around them. Combined at high doses, they produce
what are called anti-cholinergic effects, which you’ll hear me discuss
briefly in the presentation, which include everything described in that
trip report along with many more severe symptoms including partial
paralysis, coma, and death. Nightshade plants are not to be messed with.

This anonymous person’s experience shows that time loses all meaning,
people you believe to be near you and even interact with aren’t there,
and their mind even imagined they were watching a tv show when the tv
wasn’t even powered on. In the presentation I called this non-ordinary
reality or altered states of consciousness, which is the only fitting
and indeed, academic, description of the perception of the user.

I want to read another Datura trip report because it reveals the
necessity for a babysitter. A shaman is a practiced babysitter who can
help the user see and experience what the shaman directs, but a
babysitter is usually just a friend who can help calm the user down when
the line tethering them to reality seems to snap.

This trip report is titled Truly the Devil’s Weed written by user
Chimpanzee. It’s particularly useful in that it includes timestamps kept
by the babysitter:

> One of my friends told me he had gone to stay with his grandparents
> for a week and noticed a plant near their house that looked a lot like
> Datura, so he went over to it and sure enough he saw the small, spikey
> pods growing near the bottom of the plant. He himself didn’t want to
> try any because he always feared any sort of hallucinogen because of
> the risk of a bad trip, but knew I had been wanting to try it for
> quite some time, so he picked one of the magical pods and wrapped it
> up in cellophane and brought them back for me. The bastard wouldn’t
> hand them over unless I paid him 20 bucks, but I figured it would be
> well worth it.  
>   
> I couldn’t wait to try them. First thing I did was found someone who
> would be a sitter for me, and that sitter was the most trustworthy
> friend I know (lets call him Steve). I asked my mom if he could sleep
> over and she said it was fine. So the next day, Steve came over around
> noon, and I got the seeds out of the pod and counted 37. I heard it
> only took like 10 or 15, and I wanted to have more so I could trip
> another time or sell them, so I decided to take 15.  
>   
> T:00.00 - Me and Steve went up to my room to take them. We put on some
> music and sat down in my bean bag chairs. I was feeling confident that
> things were going to go smoothly, mostly just because Steve was there
> with me, he was a very responsible person who I felt very safe and
> secure with. Of course I had a little butterflies in my stomach
> because I was taking something new, but it was mostly excitement, a
> total 'I can’t wait' feeling. As Steve and I talked, I decided it was
> time, and pulled the sandwich baggie out of my pocket. I got all the
> seeds in my palm and looked at them, little teardrop shaped things,
> darkish brown, almost black. I thought to my self 'here goes nothing'
> and licked my palm to get all the seeds stuck on my tongue, chewed ‘em
> up a bit, and swallowed. As they went down I got this overwhelming
> feeling of 'finally'. I have finally taken this crazy Datura, and in
> time I will be experiencing it. All I could do now is relax, keep the
> best state of mind I possibly could, and wait for things to kick in.  
>   
> T:00.30 - Went down to the kitchen with Steve to get a drink of water,
> and then went to the bathroom. No noticeable effects. Steve suggested
> we play video games while we wait for it to kick in. We went back to
> my room and played Mario Kart 64 and snacked on some doritos.  
>   
> T:00.50 - Starting to feel different. A lot like when you need to
> stretch really bad, but in my whole body. Mouth is getting dry, very
> similar to the cottonmouth after smoking a thick blunt. Steve is
> winning the game and I am loosing my grip on the controller, and I
> can’t seem to keep the A button pushed down. After about 10 minutes
> I feel much different, very intense, and I’m wondering why Steve is in
> my room playing video games. He reminds me that he is sleeping over to
> watch me because I took Datura. Right after he says this a wave of
> shock and fear run down my body like goosebumps, for I had completely
> forgotten the reason he was there, and that I had taken anything,
> although I do recall it, I am needless to say in shock at what just
> happened with my brain. I look at Steve and say 'calm me down', and
> somehow, Steve knew exactly what to do. He just smiled at me in this
> reassuring smile and said 'don’t worry man, you’re gonna have a blast'
> this made me feel incredibly better, and my mood shifted. After this,
> things seem to go back to normal, and I ask Steve to stop playing
> video games and go downstairs with me. We go downstairs into my
> kitchen and I pull a full pitcher of cherry kool-aid from the fridge.
> Steve got 2 glasses, then we went into my living room and sat down on
> the couch. I pour the both of us a glass and we sip it while watching
> tv. Afer I finish my glass I pick up the pitcher and gulp it down
> halfway. I am very thirsty, but the drink doesn’t seem to quench my
> thirst at all, it seems to glide over the surface of my mouth, leaving
> it dry still. I now just try my best to ignore it, and continue
> watching tv.  
>   
> T:01:30 I tell Steve I’ll be right back, and walk to the bathroom.
> While I piss I look at this picture above my toilet. It’s a cartoon of
> a polar bear lying on its back in the water, holding a wine glass like
> it fell asleep from being drunk. The concept makes me want to laugh,
> it seems like the dumbest cartoon in the world to me, and its location
> is just as random as its contents. I think to my self 'why the f\*\*\*
> do we have a picture of a drunk polar bear in our bathroom'. For some
> reason, this seems near hysterical to me.  
>   
> I walk out of the bathroom and go back to the couch with Steve. As
> soon as I sit down, my mom walked out of the kitchen and tells us
> she’s going to work and to behave, she’ll be back around 10. Steve
> and I say good bye and she leaves. Perfect. Now we have the house to
> ourselves.  
>   
> T:02:00 - Nothing much more seems to be happening. I have finished the
> pitcher of kool-aid and gone to the bathroom 2 more times. Steve says
> to go in the kitchen and refill the pitcher with water in case I feel
> like I’m going to dehydrate. It seems like a responsible idea so I go
> into the kitchen and refill it with water and put ice cubes in it. I
> walk back into my living room to find Steve has left, and the tv has

> go back on, but the screen is blank, and I hear Steve saying 'hey I’m
> over here'. I realize that he’s calling me from out in my backyard, so

Let’s get back to the presentation.

T+ 10:34

Let’s discuss this book briefly and why it’s important. Primitive
Physick, as stated in the presentation, was written by one of the
cofounders of Methodism. Materia Medica and herbal remedy books were
incredibly common at the time and Primitive Physick is John Wesley’s
proprietary version. In this book, it describes over 300 ailments with
over 800 herbal cures for them. One I found quite notable was for
“Vigilia, Inability to Sleep” or insomnia. One of the cures listed for
this ailment on page 111 is “a Poultis of *Henbane* and *Poppy-Seed*,
beaten together”. Opium puts the user to sleep while the nightshade,
Henbane, will certainly give them incredible dreams and keep them under
for many hours longer than the opium itself. Wesley was also really into
cold-bathing and electrification; electricity being such a mysterious
force of nature in the mid-1700s. I would also like to point out that
Wesley’s Primitive Physick includes a section on abortions, how to cause
and how to prevent them, as was common in almost all of these herbal
remedy books. That bears significance when we consider Nauvoo and the
need for concealing the practice of polygamy. Ability to induce
abortions via herbal toxins wasn’t an unknown practice until John C.
Wreck-it Bennett came along, half a dozen church leaders were just as
capable of inducing them as Bennett was. Notably as well, many of the
herbal remedy books also contains salves and ointments for relieving
symptoms of STIs, which would have come in handy particularly in the
Nauvoo-era of Mormonism. Notably, counselor to Joseph Smith, Frederick
G. Williams, had a proprietary herbal remedy he titled “bachelor’s
delight,” although I’m unable to find the ingredients to know if it was
most likely used to alleviate burning genitals or as an intoxicant to
put women who were resilient to the practice of polygamy into a more
suggestible state of mind.

I want to take a second to talk about this History of Drugs books by
Pierre Pomet from 1748. This book is absolutely incredible. You can find
a copy on archive.org and I highly recommend it. The book is simply
beautiful. What I find notable about this book isn’t just that it
includes extensive descriptions and pictures of various herbs, but that
herbal remedies are only one section of the book. It also includes a
massive section on animals from around the globe with artist’s
representations. There are hand-drawn pictures of alligators, goats and
unicorns, elephants and rhinos, skinks, even whales, which are
hilarious, and a dozen other animals that were mysterious to western
cultures and readers. But, the most notable section of the History of
Drugs includes the medicinal and practical properties of metals and
minerals. In the section about stones, it lists the “Nephritick stone”
spelled very similar to Nephi. The medicinal properties of the
Nephritick stone apparently helped with “gravel in the kidneys,” kidney
stones, and the user hangs the Nephritick stone near their thigh and it
apparently draws out the kidney gravel. But, one of the visual
descriptions of the stone is remarkable. “Of latter Years there is
brought into Use for the same Diseases, a brown smooth, shining Stone,
which they call, from its great Virtues, the *Divine Stone*;”

The books describes other healing properties of the Nephritick stone and
its use in divination or scrying, but I find it remarkable that the
visual description matches closely with the smooth chocolate-colored
stone used for scrying by Joseph Smith. Once again, this History of
Drugs books is absolutely remarkable

Let’s get back to the presentation.

T+ 16:26

Brief pause here. This is a point I tried to drive home during the
original Sunstone presentation on the Smith-entheogen theory. When Cody
had done his portion of the presentation, he and I crafted a game
together where we alluded to and played with some of these codenames. I,
in my ignorance, introduced the game in a way which was dismissive of
the world of herbal remedies, but the central point of the game still
remained intact. This is possibly the most important point in the
presentation you’re listening to now, specific herbs and roots could
only be identified by codenames which were only known by initiates who
had studied under the watchful eye of an adept herbal remedy
practitioner. Sacred words for sacred knowledge.

Let’s get into the occult:

T+ 23:10 First off, that joke was terrible but that’s what happens when
I go off script. What I really want to take note of here is the passage
from Agrippa. Due to time constraints of the presentation, I cut a
significant portion of that passage, but there’s so much incredible
information there when read through the eyes of mycovision.

> Let no man wonder how great things suffumigations can do in the air,
> especially when he shall with Porphyrius consider that by certain
> vapors, exhaling from proper suffumigations, airy spirits are
> presently raised, as also thunderings and lightnings, and such like
> things… There are also suffumigations under opportune influences of
> the Stars that make the images of spirits forthwith appear in the air
> or elsewhere… Also it is said, that a fume made of the root of the
> reedy herb sagapen, with the juice of hemlock and henbane, and the
> herb tapsus barbatus, red sanders, and black poppy, makes spirits and
> strange shapes appear; and if smallage be added to them, the fume
> chaseth away spirits from any place and destroys their visions. In
> like manner, a fume made of calamine, peony, mints, and palma christi,
> drives away all evil spirits and vain imaginations.

Here is where Agrippa seemingly jumps into codenames for certain plants
and herbs, although some could be literal. It’s tough to know for sure
without being a 17<sup>th</sup>-century occult practitioner what he’s
really saying with this next passage.

> Moreover, it is said that by certain fumes certain animals are
> gathered together and also put to flight, as Pliny mentions concerning
> the stone liparis, that with the fume thereof all beasts are called
> out. So the bones in the upper part of the throat of a hart, being
> burnt, gather all the serpents together; but the horn of the hart,
> being burnt, doth with its fume chase them all away. The same doth a
> fume of the feathers of peacocks. Also, the lungs of an ass, being
> burnt, puts all poisonous things to flight; the fume of the burnt hoof
> of a horse drives away mice; the same doth the hoof of a mule; with
> which, also, if it be the hoof of the left foot, flies are driven
> away. And, they say, if a house or any place be smoked with the gall
> of a cuttle-fish, made into a confection with red storax, roses, and

> taken away; and that spirits shall continually keep it, and if any one
> shall endeavor to take it away he shall be hurt by them and shall fall
> into a frenzy.

I know this is all tough to listen to, and I promise, it’s even harder
to decode, but essentially Agrippa is saying that a person who is
attempting to conceal buried treasure will do so by suffumigating
coriander, saffron, henbane, smallage, and opium, all mixed together in
the juice of hemlock. By doing so, they invoke a protection spell over
their buried treasure. In other places in this book along with other
occult books, it describes how these binding spells are broken by
similar methods along with magic circles using iron or witch-hazel rods
in the ground around the supposed location of the buried treasure, which
is found by a diviner or scryer using their magic implements. This whole
system of occult and treasure digging is internally cohesive, and I make
the argument that much of the mindset is driven by suffumigations and
the ritualism that provides the set and setting for the suffumigated
dosage to take proper effect.

I want to read a small portion from 2 chapters ahead, chapter 45 page
187 titled “Of Collyries, Unctions, Love-Medicines, and their Virtues.”

He begins with talking about unguents (ointments or salves) and
collieries (eye-drops) providing the psychoactive effects of the plants
used to make them.

> Moreover, collieries, and unguents, conveying the virtues of things
> natural and celestial to our spirit, can multiply, transmute,
> transfigure, and transform it accordingly, as also transpose those
> virtues which are in them into it; that so, it cannot act only upon
> its own body, but also upon that which is near it, and affect that by
> visible rays, charms, and by touching it with some like quality… Hence
> by the touch sometimes sickness, poisonings, and love is induced; some
> things, as the hands or garmets, being anointed. Also by kisses, some
> things being held in the mouth, love is induced;…

This is troubling if we think of the ramifications of the practices
Agrippa is here detailing. He’s literally talking about date-rape drugs
that are held in the mouth and transferred through a kiss, kept on the
tip of a finger whereby the predator touches their prey and the effect
is transferred by transdermal application, or just by rubbing some of
the oil on their clothes, thereby anointing them to be charmed by the
Love-Medicine. Why were witches so feared by learned men? They could put
the men under their spell and cause them to do all sorts of things. What
did Jo do when one of his teenage wives wasn’t fully on board with
becoming one of his wives? Met with them and told them they would
receive a spiritual confirmation, after which they would go home and
have visions of angels with swords or conjured spirits. When we think of
the term aphrodisiac, sure it can mean something that lulls somebody
into a state of fiery passion, but it can also mean something that puts
them in a suggestible hypnotic trance where they lose all their rational
faculties and no longer suffer from those pesky Victorian sexual ideals.
If you think Joseph Smith was above drugging women for his own personal
gain, you and I have a very different Joseph Smith living in our minds.
Agrippa provides an example of a witch using hypnotic herbs to seduce
men.

> The same opinion was of Austin of, for, he saith, whilst he was in
> Italy, he heard of some women that by giving sorceries in cheese to
> travelers, turned them into working cattle, and when they had done
> such work as they would have them, turned them into men again; and
> that this befell a certain priest called Prestanitius.

This chapter is full of incredible stuff. He talks about suffumigations
or unctions that cause men to speak in their sleep, to walk and do
things which are done by men that are awake; “and sometimes to do those
things which men that are awake cannot or dare not do.” He continues to
describe various hallucinations induced by these powerful plants.

> Some there are that make us to hear horrid or delectable sounds, and
> such like. And this is the cause why maniacal and melancholy men
> believe they see and hear those things without which their imagination
> doth only fancy within; hence they fear things not to be feared, and
> fall into wonderful and most false suspicions, and fly when non
> pursueth them; are also angry and contend, nobody being present, and
> fear where no fear is.

These all read to me like symptoms of nightshade hallucinations. People
fearing where there is nothing to fear. People see and hear things only
their imagination fancies within. People fall into false suspicions and
run away from something only they can see. These hallucinations aren’t
typical of most psychedelics, but fit perfectly within the profile of
the hexing herbs known as the nightshade family. One final reading from
Agrippa:

> Such like passions also can magical confections induce, by
> suffumigations, by collyries, by unguents, by potions, by poisons, by
> lamps and lights, by looking-glasses, by images, enchantments, charms,
> sounds and music. Also by divers rites, observations, religions and
> superstitions; all which shall be handled in their places.

Agrippa acknowledges what’s known by users of entheogens today. A person
can get into these altered states of consciousness through ritualism he
calls “divers rites, observations, religions, and superstitions, but
psychedelics provide a shortcut. This is a point I failed to make in the
presentation for lack of time, but Cody wonderfully illustrated during
his portion of the 2017 Sunstone presentation, which, of course, you can
find in the backlog or the video of it on YouTube.

Let’s get back to the presentation.

T+ 30:22

I’ve done my best to massage and work the audio to make these questions
audible. It may be tough to hear and understand everything and the audio
fluctuates a bit, so I’m sorry about that, but please stick around for
the Q\&A section because it provides the opportunity to dive deeper into
the context and evidence for the theory. The first person asking a
question is a scholar named Clyde Forsberg who flew to New York from
Kyrgyzstan just for the John Whitmer Conference. Asking you listeners to
travel to St. George for next year’s conference isn’t too much to ask,
right? I’ll most certainly be presenting an update to this update on the
Smith-entheogen theory at next year’s St. George, Utah conference.

That does it for the update on the Smith-entheogen theory after it
resting for nearly 2 years since the Sunstone presentation by Cody
Noconi and yours truly. Of course, this was merely a high-level overview
of all the data going in to the Smith-entheogen book that will come out
when I finish it, whenever that might be. A paper about all of this will
be coming out in the Journal of Psychedelic Studies soon and I got some
amazing feedback from this presentation that will allow me to focus and
retool a working draft of another paper for submission to the John
Whitmer Journal. The social science of history happens by degrees and
moves at a glacial pace, but hopefully you can tell from the Q\&A
section that many people are looking forward to academic journal papers
and the book on this provocative subject.

The immediate feedback was great. Everybody in attendance was super
engaged and after the presentation Brian and I were surrounded by a gang
of folks with dozens of questions. The resounding conclusion of
everybody who talked to me afterwards was telling me to get this
research out there because they want to see it.

A small anecdote for all the listeners, Dan Vogel attended the
presentation which made me very happy to see. For those of you who don’t
know the name, Vogel is one of the current foremost scholars on Joseph
Smith. I read from his source and text critical edition of the History
of the Church nearly every episode and few people have done more to shed
light on the life of Joseph Smith through original documents than Dan
Vogel has. Notably, Dan is quite skeptical of the Smith-entheogen theory
and of my work in general because he doesn’t think Mormon history is a
story to be told, so much as a rigorous academic battlefield on which
he’s been a general for over 3 decades. It’s fun, though, because he’s
so incredibly skeptical but I believe he has a morbid fascination with
the Smith-entheogen theory, even if he doesn’t believe there’s much
merit to it. His feedback to me after the presentation was that I’m a
good presenter, but that he wishes I picked a different subject, which
made me laugh. Vogel is a fierce academic and my presentation walk fine
lines of academic mixed with entertainment value, which I believe he
thinks degrades the sanctity of the field. My overall point in telling
about Dan is that I’m very excited for the future of publishing on the
Smith-entheogen theory because I have reason to believe that Dan, as a
fellow atheist, may be one of the harshest critics. Good. I welcome
criticism because so far the only criticism on the theory, in general,
that I’ve received is that I haven’t published it in an academic journal
yet. I need somebody like Dan to take the theory seriously and contend
with it critically so it can truly experience the rigor of the academic
field necessary to cull away the weak evidence and spotlight the strong.
I also quipped to him that if he tried a psychedelic once it might
change his mind… he laughed, whether it was at the remark or at me, I
couldn’t tell.

One of the people who asked a question during the Q\&A was Barbara Jones
Brown, the executive director of the Mormon History Association, a
well-renowned historian, a BYU and UofU journalism and historian
graduate respectively, and a believing historian who’s worked with Rick
Turley and many other official historians for the church on various. She
and I had a wonderful conversation after the presentation and she gave
me some fantastic ideas to help substantiate the theory. I’m excited to
tell all of you about it but that’s only going to patrons of the show
over at patreon.com/nakedmormonism as my way of saying thank you for
providing the resources necessary to research and present this
information. Patrons will also get a story about a super-secret special
history tour I attended during the conference. Knowing the right
historians certainly has its perks.

To wrap up today, I just want to say that the John Whitmer Historical
Association is truly a remarkable conference. The caliber of historians
and scholars who comprise the majority of attendees makes it an amazing
academic experience, and the presentations are fascinating.

Here are a few of the sessions during this year’s conference:

Frederick Douglass & Joseph Smith III: The Memoir Revisited by Kevin W.
Bryant, Joseph Smith’s Courting: Plural Marriage in Nauvoo by Susan
Staker, The Art of Polygamy by Kelly McAfee, The Spirit, like a Fire: A
World for Joseph Smith by Rick Grunder, and the Family That Built Canals
by my personal friend and moderator of the presentation you just
listened to, Vickie Speek. This is the absolute cutting-edge of Mormon
history research and if you wonder where I get my history from to bring
to the show, it’s from the articles, books, and presentations provided
by this body of unequalled historians and scholars. These people provide
the foundation for the narrative you listen to every week on the show
and I’m forever indebted to all of them for their tireless efforts and
decades of constant, unwavering research.

Next year, in late September, JWHA will be in St. George, Utah. I know a
lot of you listeners live in Utah and probably some of you even live in
St. George. I implore you to consider attending next year, or at least
keep the possibility of attending in the back of your mind. If you
listen to this show, you have enough of a historical foundation of
Mormonism to understand the presentations in proper historical context
and why each session is important. You’ll likely meet some of the
historians whose work I frequently cite on this podcast. Maybe you’ll
bring your copy of their books with you to get autographs or buy a copy
from one of the book retailers there to have the author sign. JWHA is a
great gathering of the greatest minds in Mormon history and it’s
completely unbounded by the correlated Brighamite narrative most of us
were taught beginning in our childhoods. Maybe I’ll see you there next
year.

Thanks for tuning in, I hope to talk at you next time, here, on the
Naked Mormonism Podcast.
