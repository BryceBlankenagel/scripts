Ep 178 – William Judas Law; Rat Patrol

On this episode, we discuss the Nauvoo Police Force and the perpetuation
of the Danite system of law. Joseph Smith was afraid there may be a
Judas or Brutus in the ranks of Mormon leadership and pointed the finger
at William Law. Law becomes the focus of an assassination attempt, which
he became aware of through a Danite who didn’t keep his mouth shut. An
inquisition is held to determine if William Law is the “dough-headed”
traitor in the ranks while spiritual wifery and Daniteism are discussed
openly behind the closed door. How will William Brutus Marks fair in his
tribunal? Tune in next week to find out\!

Have you heard a politician make a speech about rooting out corruption?
They’re going to get elected and fight the entire system of corruption
and restore power back to the people\! It’s an old yarn we’ve listened
to for a long time but rarely seems to go anywhere in spite of people
generally wanting less corruption. We may disagree about the means to
attain less corruption, but most of us would agree that it’s a good
thing.

The Nauvoo Kingdom on the Mississippi had a corruption problem.
Religion, politics, and money flowed all directions and many people were
living in quite comfortable means by ill-gotten gains. The city,
however, was led by an incorruptible white night who spoke for god.
While Joseph Smith may have been a man, he was so much more than a man.
He was an icon of perfection. He communed with Jehovah and secured the
political power enjoyed by the Mormons for the past 5 years. He worked
endlessly not for himself, but for the common good of the Mormon people.
And all of those were lies that Jo worked very hard to keep true in the
minds of ten-thousand Mormons living in the area.

However, there were others. Jo’s hold on power hadn’t come from being
born into a royal family or owning many large businesses to buy himself
into the highest caste of society, he’d hooked and crooked to claw his
way to the top of his little criminal empire. Others who saw his rise
and understood the darker human side of the prophet could turn traitor
if the opportunity for their own rise opened.

Jo jealously guarded the power he’d worked for a decade and a half to
obtain. Like any mafia villain, when he power was threatened or somebody
close to him knew too much for their own good, only a few options
existed for Jo to employ in order to keep his power comfortably in his
own hands and keep from rumors about the criminal side of the
Mississippi Kingdom from going public.

One of the greatest threats to Jo in early 1844 was William Law. A lot
of conjecture exists about what happened, but William Law was the
replacement in the church presidency for Freddy G. Willey when he died
back in 1842. At that point, Law was raised to the highest-ruling body
of church authority while holding the office of General of the Nauvoo
Legion. When he attained this high position, he was allowed to learn
about the greatest mysteries of Mormon theology, including polygamy.
Something happened between William Law and his wife, Jane, and Jo and
Emma. The record doesn’t tell us exactly what happened, and first-hand
accounts conflict, but it’s reasonable to conclude that a deal was
brokered between Jo and Emma that she could take William as a spiritual
husband if Jo got Jane as a spiritual wife. The deal soured and the
relationship between the Smiths and Laws was forever destroyed.

From that point forward, William and Jane Law increasingly became
enemies of Jo’s criminal empire. They knew too much for their own good.
Could they be trusted? Jo didn’t think so and devised a plan to have
William put out of the way.

William was tipped off about the Danite plan to feed him to the
Mississippi catfishes and he entered a complaint against the prophet. A
special counsel was called in early January 1844 to determine if Jo had
sworn out a secret oath with some of the Nauvoo police force to make Law
disappear. This sets our scene for today as we’re going to read through
the council minutes of what transpired. This special council meeting
reveals so much of Nauvoo Mormonism and the way Jo conducted his
criminal empire. We’ll discuss each event and the importance of it as
each testimony is given and each person is called to the stand. This is
the hearing to figure out if William Law was the dough-headed traitor Jo
feared him to be. Dough head is a term we’re going to run into a lot
today, but it doesn’t mean idiot like intuition would imply. Dough head
or dough face back then referred to a person who’s head or face was made
of dough and therefore pliable or moldable, especially politicians.
Northern politicians who accepted slavery were seen as dough heads
because their morals were moldable, usually with a little doe, meaning
money. Jo trying to find out who the dough head here is him trying to
root out the traitor who he saw as moldable to the directions of the
Missourians, or any of Jo’s enemies for that matter, who wanted to
arrest and execute him for being a tyrant.

> The Mayor directed the marshal to notify William Law and John Snyder
> that the council was in session, and informed the council that William
> Law had said to his brother Hyrum that the police had been sworn by
> him secretly to put Law out of the way.

A brief pause here to queue us in to the military aspect of Nauvoo. The
Nauvoo Legion was the state-sanctioned militia Jo had been able to have
approved by the Illinois State Legislature. But the Legion was just a
militia and there was no reason to have them act as a police force
unless Nauvoo was under martial law, which happened from time to time.
The Nauvoo Police force was Jo’s personal uniformed bodyguard squad.
I’ve talked to many people who say they are descendants of one of Jo’s
personal bodyguards. I’m even a descendant of one of his bodyguards.
Being Jo’s bodyguard merely meant members of the city police force whose
primary job was to make sure nobody messed with Jo, you know, like it
was a dictatorship or something.

The crux of the complaint filed by William Law was that Jo had made a
secret pact with just a few of the Nauvoo City police force that they
were practicing Danites, the shadow military from the Missouri-Mormon
War era of 1838. As part of this secret oath, Law suspected Jo told them
to kill him and never reveal to anybody that there was a secret group
within the police force that operated outside the bounds of their
regular duties.

Here’s Jo’s response to Law’s accusation:

> “I have had no private conversation with any of the police, but the
> high policeman, Jonathan Dunham, and that was to request him to have
> especial care of my personal safety, as I apprehended attempts to
> kidnap me by the Missourians.”

So, Jo denied having made any secret pact with the Danite policemen, but
to prove it he called on the policemen in attendance at the meeting.

> He called on the policemen to say, if they had received any private
> oath from him, when they all said No\!

Because of course they’d say no. Jo being a criminal kingpin was
literally the issue underpinning this complaint by William Law and the
police force wasn’t going to rat him out. They’d sworn oaths to stand by
their brethren in defending the prophet to death, even if doing so came
in conflict with the law. This is straight-up mafia family stuff right
here.

> Councilor Hyrum Smith said that William Law told him the police had

Apparently William Law was under some kind of notion that Hyrum
Sidekick-Abiff Smith was more honorable than his younger brother prophet
and confided in Hyrum that Law knew of a plot that the police were going
to kill him around March or April of that year. Of course, when Hyrum
knew there was a problem, that information quickly made its way up to
the prophet.

> The Mayor said he wished policemen to understand forever, that all he
> wanted was, that they should execute the ordinances of the city, and
> his order, according to law.

Whose law? That’s the real question here because Nauvoo had two sets of
laws. One that the regular people followed, and the other that Jo and
the leadership followed. Whose laws did Jo want the policemen to follow?
Which set of laws would benefit Jo the most?

> Several of the police called for the individual to be named who made
> the statement to William Law.

“Who’s the rat?\!” That’s what this is. This is rat control to figure
out who squealed and tighten up their lips. Jo wanted to immediately get
to the bottom of who told Law that there was a plan to have Law removed.
These policemen had sworn an oath to protect the prophet at all costs.
Somebody violated that oath. Any leaks like this in a criminal empire is
a massive threat.

William Law was told that Jo feared a dough-headed Judas at his right
hand and reasonably feared he might be the person labeled as a traitor.
William Law was in a massively high ranking in church and military
leadership. Hyrum was Jo’s partner in crime, William Law was in the
place of being the right-hand man, but he was a more moral and honorable
person, not somebody a crime lord wants at his right hand because
they’re a massive threat. Alderman Harris began his line of
questioning with William Law.

> Ald\[erman\]. Harris. Who is the person, and who told you?
> 
> Law. I am under obligations *not* to tell.
> 
> Ald. Harris. That is immaterial, you are bound to disclose the whole
> truth here by virtue of your oath.
> 
> Law. I am afraid to tell; one oath is as good as another.

This is an interesting exchange. Law was now on the stand in this
special counsel sworn to testify under oath, being questioned by Jo the
Mayor and one of his crony aldermen. But, of course, Law had likely
sworn an oath to the person who informed him of the assassination
attempt because if that information got out, the rat would be
exterminated. But, of course, Jo held all the aces here.

> The Mayor said he would protect him (Law); he was bound to tell.
> 
> Law. Said he would tell who told him and he might tell the name of the
> police. Eli Norton told me.
> 
> Ald. Harris. Was Eli Norton of the police?
> 
> Law. No; but he got his information from Daniel Carn, who is a
> policeman.

Unfortunately, the documents themselves, recorded by William Wines
Double-Dub Phelps, don’t tell the full story or reveal the body language
which communicated the deeper implications of what happened here.
Essentially, Jo squeezed it out of Law who the rat was. Law had made an
oath with the leaker to keep it secret, but Jo had a lot more power of
William Law than this one random policeman rat. Law giving up the name
so quickly reveals he feared Jo much more than some policeman.

> The marshal was sent to bring Eli Norton.

Now, Jo was getting closer to the bottom of this. Law had given up his
informant and the marshal was sent immediately to bring him before the
tribunal. As the Marshal carried out his duty, Jo decided to take a
moment to make a grand display of his honesty by asking all the
policemen in the room if he’d ever had a private conversation with them,
by implication asking if any of them in the room would openly rat him
out. Whatever this looked like was apparently rather terrifying to some
of those in attendance including Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith. I don’t
understand the deeper implication of why it was so alarming, but I can
only suspect it was due to the fact that each and every one of the
policemen were so resolutely in lockstep behind whatever the prophet
dictated. That, or maybe some of the policemen didn’t have as much
resolve as the record dictates, which would have been even more
terrifying to Jo and Hyrum, which also explains their individual
speeches after the demonstration.

> They did not design to try me; but hang me,--or take my life
> anyhow—that they had a man in our midst who would fix me out, if
> they could not get me into their power without.”…

A recitation of the “persecution” Jo and the Mormons had suffered was
always a good means to justify nearly any action and that’s what
happened here. Hyrum talked about Dr. Sampson Avard betraying the
Danites in Missouri when he swore out affidavits about the Danite’s
existence to Missouri government officials and then Jo jumps off Hyrum’s
screed to talk about how many times he’d been arrested, or kidnapped as
he saw it, to face the law, or being hanged unlawfully as he saw it.
After this dramatic scene transpired, the city marshal returned with the
man William Law said leaked the assassination plot to him. Eli Norton
was the guy who wasn’t a member of the police force, but he told William
Law that Jo was devising a way to kill Law. It was Daniel Carn who was
the member of the Nauvoo police force that told Norton, who told Law.
First, Eli Norton took the stand.

> tell where the danger was expected to come from; told me there were

> mayor was in danger from the dough-heads.

Eli Norton, having not witnessed the sequence of events in the special
counsel up to this point, took the stand and simply denied everything.
Of course, William Law must have been blown away by this because he just
told Jo about the leaker because Law feared Jo’s power more than
anything Norton or Carn might do to him. He was understandably
frustrated and asked Norton directly about what Norton had told him. Law
is the supposed dough-head who must be taken care of here.

> Question by William Law: Did you not understand from brother Carn,
> that he was suspicious of some person near Joseph being a dough-head,
> and must be taken care of, and that that person was myself?
> 
> Answer: Yes. He \[Carn\] mentioned a dough-head as being very near
> Joseph, and he guessed you was the man, and I thought it might be that
> Daniteism was not done with.

Carn was afraid that Daniteism was not done with. Daniteism of course
being the way Jo dealt with dissenters, the shadow military hit-squad Jo
used to get rid of people. Norton told William Law that Law’s life was
in danger explicitly because he thought Law might get a visit from the
Danites.

Before getting to the next portion of Norton’s statement, which was
removed from the History of the Church but has been restored from the
original document thanks to the painstaking work of historian Dan Vogel,
let’s discuss this in the meta for a second. The only reason this
special counsel happened was because the Danites weren’t successful in
putting William Law out of the way in the first place. Had they been
successful and some of the more seedy characters within the Nauvoo
police force were able to put Law out of the way, this hearing never
would have happened. Law would simply be dead, the Nauvoo Expositor
never would have been published, and Mormon history would look much
different today. But, because Carn told Norton and Norton told Law that
the Danites were out to get him, Law survived the attempted
assassination and was able to air out his grievances to this special
counsel. Phelps recording the statements made under oath here reveal
many troubling trends in the Nauvoo criminal justice system. Not
criminal justice system, *criminal* justice system. This entire tribunal
reveals just how insanely corrupt Nauvoo under Joseph Smith truly was.
Now, however, we get to the crux of the issue that caused Law to be put
on a hit list in the first place. This next point in Norton’s testimony,
and much of the remaining testimonies, reveals that the lines historians
use to divide celestial marriage and spiritual wifery were actual far
more blurry at the time.

> **\[We\] had conversation on Spiritual Wives.—I did not believe.—knew

There was another law, the law of God. In the law of god, men get more
wives based on their ecclesiastical standing and loyalty to the prophet,
and the will of god is enforced by a shadow military system.

Each quorum is to remain in their lane and not tell another quorum what
their conduct is. We’ve discussed extensively on this podcast how the
evolution of Mormon authority and priesthood offices usually resulted in
external factors requiring higher and higher offices Jo created for
himself to be king over. The office of Elder was created in 1830 to be
the ruling officers of the church, but when there were too many elders,
suddenly we have bishops, priests, deacons, two different priesthoods,
Aaronic and Melchizedek, 2 quorums of seventies, quorum of twelve
apostles, high council, patriarchs, high priests, stakes and stake
presidents, auxiliary presidencies, and a litany of other offices
constructed into the lattice of Mormon authority, always with Jo at the
top. This point in Norton’s testimony, which I will remind you was
removed from the HoC for understandable reasons, reveals that an aspect
of these different quorums was that they operated at different degrees
with differing levels of knowledge of how the church ran. Deacons pass
that sacrament, bishops handle local congregations, stake president
handle regional conglomerations of wards, but to know what really
happens behind closed doors, to see the blueprints and construction
plans for Talos, you gotta be in the highest quorums. Segregation not
only of duties, but of knowledge of the grand plans to overthrow the
nation. Just because you’re a made man, doesn’t mean you get all the
keys to the kingdom. As in Nauvoo, just like today, Mormonism is a
need-to-know basis criminal empire religion.

The next sentence wasn’t removed from the HoC, but it reveals the
breakdown of Phelps taking notes based on the conversation that’s
happening and that this clearly isn’t a fully-accurate recounting of
everything which was said in the special counsel.

> There was no chain to the conversation, but I drew the inference that
> brother Law was the dough-head from Carn’s conversation; but Carn did
> not name Law.

Now, Norton was done testifying about spiritual wives, Daniteism,
dough-heads within the highest ranks of church leadership, and Daniel
Carn, the policeman who supposedly told Norton about the plot to kill
Law in the first place, was put on the stand.

> Daniel Carn was sworn, said: “**I told him \[Norton\] we were sworn
> and our duties specified. I said by the covenant we have made in
> Baptism we are bound to protect each other in righteousness. Daniteism
> is to stand by each other that is all I know about Daniteism.—Mayor
> said he was not afraid of any thing but a doe head in our midst. In
> our conversation we referred to spiritual wives and one thing brought
> on another.—I was asked who can that man be? I give my opinion.**

Now, that previous passage was removed from the HoC because we can’t
have pesky little facts like Daniteism and Spiritual Wifery getting out
there, however, the next passage is what was included from Daniel Carn’s
testimony that wasn’t removed from the HoC. I simply love this passage
but I think it’s important to note the perception gained from reading
the edited version versus reading the original documents as Dan Vogel
has restored in his source and text critical edition of the HoC. If we
read this tribunal as the original editors of the HoC determined, it
would be rather benign and about finding out who the dough-head is. But,
when read from the original document, this is one of the most telling
and, frankly, troubling hearings in all of Joseph Smith Nauvoo history.
The original documents reveal that Law’s suspicions and fear for his
life were absolutely founded, that Jo would utilize a shadow assassin
squad to remove a high-ranking church official who disagreed with him
about polygamy. Law didn’t like Nauvoo Mormonism being run as a criminal
regime and he was one of the few who could publicly oppose the prophet
and his grand plans. Jo wanted to kill William Law and justified that
desire by calling Law a Judas. This hearing was actually about rat
patrol. Who was the Danite who leaked the plan to William Law? Who was
the whistle-blower so we can seal up the Danite squad to be tight like
unto a dish? But, with more than half of the testimonies removed from
the HoC, you never get to see what this tribunal is really about. So,
what was Jo mad about Carn doing here if we just read the published HoC?
Well, it’s a rather fun little passage.

> \[“\]I told brother Norton that certain men had been counseled by the
> Prophet to invest their means in the publishing the new translation of
> the Bible; and they, instead of obeying that counsel, had used their

> business, but sunk their hemp in the Mississippi river. I told him it
> was my opinion that brother Law was the dough-head referred to.

Dough-head? More like Dope-head\! That’s what this tribunal is about if
you just read the published HoC, but when we read the actual source
documents, the entire issue become about much more than Jo being mad
these guys were running a pot farm instead of investing money into
publishing his translation of the Bible. You see how little edits like
this change so much context? These tens of thousands of edits throughout
the entire 7-volume set quantify into such a massive censoring of
documents, it’s no wonder Mormons know nothing of their own history\!

Yeah, breaking up families is kind of part and parcel when it comes to
polygyny. There’s only so many women to go around all these wealthy
church leaders so of course they have to break up families to take their
30<sup>th</sup> wife. This is an important point though because
everybody in the special counsel was aware that spiritual wifery and
celestial marriage was a thing, especially William Law. The reason Law
was a threat was because he was one of the few who was so vociferously
opposed to Jo and Emma’s deal proposal that Jo feared he might turn
Judas and go public with the accusations and print the revelation for
all to see. Eventually that sort of happened in that the Nauvoo
Expositor included numerous affidavits from people who were present when
Hyrum read the revelation to the High Council, but if the text of that
revelation got out there, it would spell the end of the Mormon empire
and Jo’s career. He’d be arrested on adultery charges and go to prison.
Law was a massive threat and he proved outside the control of Jo, unlike
Hingepin Rigdon and others who were opposed to polygyny but chose to
keep their mouths shut.

The next question from William Law wasn’t a question so much as a retort
against what Carn had said about Law’s claims concerning spiritual
wifery.

> **\[Question\] By Law. Did I not say we have a good foundation because
> Joseph blew it all up before the High Council, and Hyrum before the
> Elders Quorum?**

And that was true. The record states the Hyrum read the polygamy
revelation, later D\&C 132, to the high council but according to Law, Jo
instructed the High Council on polygamy while Hyrum told the Elders
Quorum. Regardless, polygamy was slowly bleeding into lower and lower
ranks of church leadership, which only gave more weight to the rumors
that Jo and Emma, through the Relief Society, were trying to keep at
bay. They had to keep a constant tension. Publicly deny the practice,
but allow rumors to go a little bit so women would be less surprised
when they were approached for a polygynous proposal. This level of
public dishonesty was required to maintain secrecy, yet maintain the
practice behind closed doors of the greatest aspiration of Mormon
theology. One man, millions of wives, and worlds without end.

> **Yes, said Cairns, \[“\]Law did not speak disrespectfully of Joseph
> or of the Church.** I have had no secret conversation whatever with
> the mayor, and never received any charge except the one, with the rest
> of the police, before the city council. **The council never heard any
> thing from me to endanger the life of any man.**”

Carn, understandably, was trying to say anything to remove any suspicion
that he was anything but loyal to the prophet. Notably, Daniel Carn was
a member of the Danites, inducted during the original formation of the
society in Missouri. He knew the oaths they took to stand by the prophet
and do whatever he commands, even if it comes into conflict with the
laws of the land. If Carn could be branded as disloyal after swearing
the Danite oath, he’d be gone before nightfall. Since the cat was out of
the bag with discussing spiritual wifery in this tribunal, Jo chose to
speak over Daniel Carn about the system and the importance of Danite
oaths.

> **Mayor spoke on spiritual wife system and explained, The man who
> promises to keep a secret and does not keep it he is a liar, and not
> to be trusted. Esq\[ui\]r\[e Daniel H.\] Wells came to me the other
> night and said that he was satisfied and pleased with all I had said,
> I did say A\[lderman\] Wells.**
> 
> **Counselor H\[yrum\] Smith spoke at considerable length.**

Polygamy was a secret, but not a very well-kept one. The fact that these
men were openly discussing it in this special counsel reveals they were
on a trajectory to make polygamy a public practice of the religion, but
with so many other things going on like Jo’s presidential campaign, that
would certainly make the practice much harder to go public with. We’re
talking less than 2 decades after the petticoat affair here. The
public’s perspective of sexuality and women’s purity would more align
with William Law than Joseph Smith should Mormonism go public with it as
they did in Utah.

Regardless, Jo and Hyrum both made speeches, only a few details of Jo’s
are extant while Hyrum’s is absent. Jo’s sentiment is what matters here,
a man who promises to keep a secret and doesn’t is a liar who can’t be
trusted. Those who didn’t keep the secrets of polygamy like William Law,
couldn’t be trusted. If Daniel Carn told Eli Norton about the plot to
kill William Law and Norton relayed that to Law, neither of those guys
could be trusted, in spite of Daniel Carn being a long-standing member
of the Danites and a trusted insider with secret oaths. Jo was certain
there was a Judas here and he’d concluded before the hearing even
commenced that the Judas was William Law. Now, the question was, what
did William Law have to say for himself in the face of all these
accusations and grand standing by Jo and Hyrum?

William Law’s proposal is that hey, Jo, we may have disagreements, but
let bygones be bygones? If you live until I want to kill you, you’ll
live to be an old man. If I live until you want to kill me, I’ll be an
old man too, right? Right Jo? We can finally bury our weapons of peace
here? Jo had insider information about Law making subtle moves to secure
an escape upon his expose. Law owned a ton of property in Nauvoo being
so highly ranked. In a later interview, William Law estimated his wealth
at the time to be about $30,000, or about $1.027 mn in today’s money. He
had “a large steam flour and saw mill and a store”. In the same
interview he also talked about his brother Wilson Law, coauthor of the
Nauvoo Expositor and the impact the paper had on them. “My brother had a
fine brick two story building. By starting the *Expositor* we lost
nearly everything.”

When the interviewer asked him about the property, William Law said
this:

> their usual system, that is, to *freeze us out*.

Jo knew William Law was considering liquifying his assets and leaving
the Mormon kingdom. That could only mean one thing, Law was about to go
public and expose Jo. Jo had survived the Wreck-it Bennett expose just a
year and a half prior to this, he wasn’t ready for another round of
dealing with an expose coming from a high-ranking and trusted member of
the innermost Mormon circles.

Jo decided to hit William Law with the hard question head on.

> **Mayor: Did I ever tell you that any body had told me that \[if\] you
> would sell your property\[,\] you would blow up Mormonism?**
> 
> **Law.—Hyrum told me that.**

The record doesn’t say anything more than that. I suspect it was a
pretty uncomfortable moment because the only reason Law would have
wanted to sell off his property in Nauvoo was if he was planning
something big. Jo knew that. Hyrum knew that. William Law knew that.
But, because Jo had total and complete control over everything in
Nauvoo, after this hearing he took moves to “freeze” out the Laws, which
William Law reveals in his later interview with Wilhelm Wymetal.

> Secret orders went out that nobody could buy property without the
> permission of Joseph Smith, Hyrum or the authorities, as they called
> them, so our property was practically worthless.

At the end of the day, Law won. He had Jo in a vulnerable position
because Law helped to build Talos. He knew the blueprints, he had
knowledge of the greatest mysteries of the Mormon kingdom and had
participated in many of the illegal affairs of the church. Law was
standing on the high ground, but Jo’s armies and assassins had him
surrounded in a modern re-creation of Samuel the Lamanite. There’s just
a little left in the hearing.

> **Bishop Cairns said he had never conveyed the idea to father Norton
> that Joseph had said that Mr Law was the Doe head.**

And by implication the Judas deserving of death by Danite bowie knife.

> **Mayor: Where a man becomes a traitor to his friend or country who is

> 
> \[…\]

Jo was a fair and just dictator. He has no problem carrying out
extralegal assassinations, but only after the person has had a moment to
defend themselves in a court of law and provide their side of the story.
Jo wrapped the hearing with a final speech. His final point reveals that
at the end of the day he felt quite safe inside his little fiefdom
because he was surrounded by loyal followers and Danites who would kill
anybody who might become a problem in any sort of way. He was the mafia
Don, and this was his way of telling Law and anybody else in attendance
who may not be 100% loyal, that he wins every single time. He could
shoot a man on Water Street in broad daylight and the people would still
vote for him to be president.

That part wasn’t removed from the HoC, even though most of what we read
today was for understandable reasons. At the end of the day, when a
believing person reads the published HoC, they see Joseph Smith is
simply trying to remove any dough-heads from his closest circle of
church leaders and they read a blanket denial of any existence of the
Danites from the prophet. When we read this hearing from the original
source text, a lot more pieces fall into place and this hearing comes
into focus for what it truly was, rat patrol. Jo knew there was a rat, a
Judas in his midst who would soon betray him, and he wanted that person
dead. William Law was that person, but Law was able to put on a good
affect and persuade Jo that he wasn’t an immediate threat. Which was
true, but only true for a few more months because in less than 5 months
from this hearing, William Law was the primary author of the Nauvoo
Expositor which catalyzed the deaths of Joseph and Hyrum Smith and
kicked off a schism crisis that shaped the face of American history from
that time forward. It may not feel like it, especially when we read the
HoC version of events, but William Law tactically won this tribunal. How
do we come to that conclusion? Well, he survived. All he had to do was
survive this tribunal and he bought himself some time, which was so
desperately short. However, Jo was right. William Law was the Judas in
his midst.

The summary of events recounted in Jo’s journal for that day is quite
interesting and reveals how much this hearing was whitewashed to remove
any of the deeper details we’ve discussed today.

> The council spent nearly the whole day in investigating the subject,
> and examining these two witnesses. The police were all sworn and

> nothing but imagination, having grown out of the surmises of Daniel

> to the death, and called the whole council and the police to witness
> his declaration.

I’m sure things ended completely amicably between Jo and Judas Law with
them shaking hands and letting friends be friends. They went on to have
a wonderful few years together as respectable friends and then Judas Law
and Jo parted ways as friends. They occasionally visited each other in
their elderly years and reminisced on the good ol’ days of Nauvoo over
strong tea. Oh, wait, that’s exactly what didn’t happen because this
little tribunal was a microcosm of what lay in store with Judas Law and
Brutus Marks.

Jo wasn’t an idiot. A colossal failure, an opportunist, overly ambitious
to the point of his own undoing, yes. But an idiot, he was not. Jo knew
there were people around him who knew too much that he couldn’t trust.
Judas Law being called on trial here was a result of what Jo did in
December of 1843 to attempt some kind of controlling mechanism over
these loose ends. From D. Michael Quinn’s 2011 Sunstone article The
Culture of Violence in Joseph Smith’s Mormonism:

Today we’ve discussed William Judas Law extensively and we’ll get into
William Brutus Marks’s trial next week. Suffice it to say Jo was a mafia
boss who had everything to lose. More than a mafia boss, he was a
cornered animal who feared for his existence. But this cornered animal
had more than superior physical power to overwhelm his inferior beta
males, he had access to superior social and political power.

In many ways, Jo’s tale is as old as time. He was a country bumpkin who
saw a way to gain wealth and power and seized every opportunity
provided. Once that wealth and power was acquired he had to jealously
guard it from those who threatened him. Judas Law and Brutus Marks were
massive chinks in the armor of the Mormon empire colossus growing in the
shadows of Nauvoo’s darkest alleys. He was a dictator with his own
military, assassin squad, harem of wives and concubines, following of
thousands who would die for their divine leader, and he controlled
everything that happened in multiple cities and dictated the direction
of the lives of each and every believing Mormon living in 1844. He had
people willing to lie under oath for him, take a bullet for him, and
walk thousands of miles across the country for him. He had everything
but it was never enough.

Power begets power, wealth creates wealth. Dogmatic fealty creates
radicalism. Jo had all these variables turned up too high and his power
was insecure as he continued to expand and grow his empire. His system
was simply not sustainable with so many threats and social forces
pushing against that expansion. He couldn’t possibly manage this chaos
for much longer, could he? With so many threats, it was nearing time for
somebody to step in who could channel that chaos into order.
