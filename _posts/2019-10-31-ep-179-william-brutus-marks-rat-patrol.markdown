Ep 179 – William Brutus Marks; Rat Patrol

On this episode, we discuss William Marks, his importance to our
timeline, and a special council called to determine how loyal he was to
the prophet. Just like last week, some had entertained thoughts that
there was a Brutus in the highest rings of Mormon leadership waiting to
backstab the prophet when his back was turned. William Marks is called
in and various church officials testify about secret oaths and plots in
the dark alleys of Nauvoo. Some police officers camp outside Marks’s
home waiting to cut him off when the time was right. Jo plays dumb and
everybody goes home for want of candles.

Two men had been scoped out as possible enemies to the prophet and some
of his deeper teachings. We discussed the tribunal of William Judas Law
last week, but another was labeled as a possible traitor to the prophet
and cause of building the kingdom of god. This other person is somebody
who’s come up before in our timeline, but only tangentially when his
name was mentioned in revelations or he was called to various leadership
positions. However, this man, William Marks, is going to occupy an
increasing amount of our timeline moving forward.

A few days after the special counsel was called to answer William Judas
Law’s complaint that Jo was trying to remove him by use of the Danite
police force, William Marks petitioned for a similar hearing, which was
answered.

We’ll read through the proceedings of his special counsel as it reveals
even deeper troubling trends in the Nauvoo government system, but first,
let’s spend a little time getting to know William Brutus Marks.

Marks was born in Rutland Co., Vermont in 1792, 13 years senior to
Joseph Smith. He married Rosannah Robinson in May of 1813 at age 20 and
they moved to Portage Co., New York when missionaries came knocking on
their door. The Marks family was baptized into the church around April
of 1835 and Marks was inducted into the office of Priest. He was
ordained as an elder the following year, after which he moved to
Kirtland when the church was amidst considerable turmoil during the
Fanny Alger scandal.

Clearly William Marks showed promise in leadership as he was inducted
into the high council of Kirtland in September of 1837 and was elevated
to Kirtland Stake President in 1838 when Jo, Rigdon, and the majority of
the Quorum of Apostles had removed to Missouri to flee legal and
ecclesiastical consequences for their conduct. Jo instructed Marks
directly to move to Far West to be a Stake President there, but the plan
for his move was thwarted as the Missouri-Mormon war, Haun’s Mill
Massacre, and arrest of Jo and other leading church officials happened
before the Marks family could make the move.

The Marks family instead moved straight to Quincy, Illinois during the
winter of 1838-9 as the Mormons were experiencing their third
mass-exodus. Jo, Rigdon, Hyrum, and other church leaders escaped from
jail in spring of 1839 and made their way to Quincy to find William
Marks doing a fantastic job of helping the Mormons settle. William
Brutus Marks was instrumental in coordinating the settlement of
Commerce, Illinois and changing it from a swampland with a few buildings
to a thriving community known as Nauvoo. William Marks, by special
appointment, was named Stake President of Commerce on 5 October 1839,
which became the Nauvoo stake in 1841 when the city charter went into
effect.

Stakes in Joseph Smith’s church are much different than today. The
Mormon church today is structured such that small localities with few
members are called branches. Above the pecking order from branches are
wards. Conglomerations of multiple wards and branches are stakes. Today
there are about 3,300 stakes worldwide. However, under Joseph Smith’s
leadership there were essentially three stakes; Kirtland, Missouri, and
Nauvoo. These were the stakes that tethered the kingdom of god to this
terrestrial sphere. So, to be a stake president, like William Marks was,
meant you were of a select group of extremely high-ranking Mormon
leaders.

But, his leadership roles didn’t end there because Marks was also named
in D\&C 124 and specifically told to purchase stock in the Nauvoo House
Association, the hotel project Jo started but never finished. He was
also in the Nauvoo Legion, a regent of the University of Nauvoo, one of
the earliest members of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, AND he would be
inducted into the Council of Fifty when it’s organized in March of 1844,
which we’ve already discussed on this show.

William Marks was one of the highest-ranking Mormon elites in Nauvoo, he
was also a personal friend of the Smiths and a generally moral person.
Marks had been one of those on the forefront defending Jo against the
supposedly slanderous accusations of John C. Wreck-it Bennett when his
expose letters and book were published in 1842.

From Mormon Enigma, the greatest biography of Emma Smith, pg 128.

> Joseph’s followers were tireless in their efforts to clear his name.
> William Marks, president of the ecclesiastical association of several
> congregations in Nauvoo (termed a Stake by the Mormons), published his

> to Marks. Truthfully, Marks said he *knew* of “no order in the church
> which *admits* to a plurality of wives” and did not “*believe* that
> Joseph Smith ever taught such a doctrine.”

Well, by late 1843, it was egg on the face of William Brutus Marks
because he’d stuck out his neck to defend Jo against the accusations of
Wreck-it Bennett, but a year after his public screed Jo was like… yeah….
We’re totally doing that plural wives thing… But, thanks for publishing
that when you did, buddy\!

When Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith learned about polygamy, he’d been in
league with William Marks and William Law in opposing it. All three of
them had defended Jo publicly against accusations of polygamy, so their
own reputations were at stake as much as all the legal and societal
complications the practice may bring upon the burgeoning sect. Once
again from Mormon Enigma, beginning on 140.

> Within the same few weeks, in the spring of 1843, both Hyrum Smith and
> Emma would accept plural marriage. Hyrum, who had disbelieved the

> Hyrum joined William Marks and William Law to “expose” Joseph and
> bring a stop to the practice. Heber C. Kimball learned of the effort
> and passed on his concerns to William Clayton, who recorded the
> incident in his diary on May 23.

Soon after this interaction, Hyrum and Bloody Brigham sat on a fence and
chatted about the secret that Jo was keeping from everybody, the
polygamy revelation was dictated a month and a half later, and then the
highest leadership bodies of the church were instructed on the practice,
the Holy Order was formed to control who knew about the practice, and
Hyrum took his second wife while William Judas Law and William Brutus
Marks continued to oppose the practice.

Teaching polygamy by reading the revelation to the high council and
elders quorum was a line-drawing moment. From that time forward a member
of the Mormon leadership could have heard the rumors and simply ignored
or dismissed them as slander. Or, if you happened to be a guy who was
interested in having multiple wives, maybe the allure of this
clandestine doctrine inspired deeper conviction. When the doctrine was
actually taught, it removed all doubt. No longer could a member of the
highest Mormon leadership ignore the accusations and rumors and consider
Wreck-it Bennett’s exposes completely baseless. Were you in or out?
Those who were in could sleep comfortably in their beds at night while
contemplating how hard it’s going to be to tell their wife about the new
and everlasting covenant of marriage. Those who were out… well… watch
your back because nobody wants a visit from a Danite.

Which brings us to the hearing we’re discussing today. William Brutus
Marks wasn’t on board with polygamy and was still smarting from putting
his name out there in defending Jo against the accusations and them
ending up all being true. Marks was concerned his general opposition to
Jo’s quickly-evolving empire would end his life. A passage from Quinn’s
second book of the Mormon Hierarchy series, Extensions of Power,
illustrates these fears were well-founded. Beginning on page 246.

> Some LDS leaders have dismissed allegations about blood atonement as
> misunderstanding or misuse of earlier sermons concerning the atonement
> of Jesus Christ or the civil necessity of capital punishment. Other
> Mormon leaders have continued to affirm that after committing “certain
> grievous sins,” a person “must make sacrifice of his own life to
> atone—so far as in his power lies—for that sin, for the blood of
> Christ alone under certain circumstances will not avail.”

What are these certain grievous sins? Number one is shedding innocent
blood. Number two is denying the gospel. Luckily for Mormon leadership,
they determine whose blood is innocent and they determine what the
gospel is and what actions constitute denying or opposing it. Early
Mormonism was a death cult. There’s no other way to put it.

Quinn continues:

But it wasn’t just thieves who deserved an immediate death penalty on
the spot…

That Law of God wasn’t created by Bloody Brigham Young, it was a tool
crafted by his predecessor and wielded expertly by the blooming tyrant.
Both William Judas Law AND William Brutus Marks were right to be afraid
for their lives as their opposition to Jo’s tyranny mounted. William
Marks’s fears came to a head when one night some men decided to lay in
wait outside his home, acting very shady, building a small fire to keep
warm because this was December, and keeping up William and Rosannah all
night as they expected the men outside were actually Danites waiting for
the opportunity to blood atone this perceived Brutus before he could
strike the Mormon Caesar.

Now we have a proper introduction to William Brutus Marks, why he’s
important to the timeline, and the context for the hearing itself. I
could summarize what transpired, but I much prefer to let the documents
tell their own stories; that’s kinda what we do on this podcast. So,
let’s get to the hearing and discuss it as we go.

It begins with a speech from Jo responding to the complaints that Marks
and Law thought they were in danger. Of course, Jo plays dumb.

> Special Session
> 
> Object of the council stated by the Mayor, similar to the last
> council, as William Law and William Marks had considered themselves in
> danger. When he heard the report he was unwilling to believe anything
> about it, from the course the thing took in the last council; but for
> the sake of others, he had called this council.

Now we discuss our first player in the hearing today, Leonard Soby. Soby
was on his way home when he was stopped by a Danite. This was peculiar
and Soby thought he himself might be in danger, but the man instead
chose to relay to Soby that Marks and Law were in danger and if either
Judas or Brutus crossed his path, they were done for.

> As Leonard Soby was going home night before last, he was hailed by a
> supposed policeman with a gun, which frightened him. Soby says that a
> policeman had told him that Marks and Law must not cross his tracks;
> that Warren Smith said at another time that William Marks and William
> Law were enemies to Joseph.

Jo responds to these Danites on the prowl for Marks and Law by
continuing to play dumb. Always remember, this was purely an act because
nothing happened in Nauvoo without Jo knowing about or allowing it. Very
few things escaped the notice of his little birds around the city.

> I have never thought even to dream of doing anything against the peace
> of the inhabitants of this city. Did not know I had any enemies in

> to investigate this matter.

Jo was at home, he couldn’t have sworn a secret oath with these
policemen to keep the peace through Danite enforcement rules, right?
This is grandstanding. He wants the special council to investigate where
all these accusation came from because apparently his blanket denials
aren’t good enough. His bit about him being home most of the time and
therefore unable to orchestrate conspiracy is exactly why we have RICO
laws for prosecuting organized crime. A crime boss never pulls the
trigger himself, but he’s responsible for sending people to the
catfishes just as much as the guy who actually pulled the trigger. After
this denial, William Brutus Marks took the stand and reports what
Leonard Soby told him about the conspiracy to kill him and William Judas
Law.

> William Marks sworn: Testified that on Monday evening, brother Soby
> came up and said “Are you aware of the danger you are in?” Marks
> replied, \[“\]No\!\[“\]
> 
> Soby: “Your life is threatened, a policeman stopped me in the dark

> threats were from that policeman, but I was mistaken. Another
> policeman, Warren Smith, said last Sunday that Joseph had enemies—that
> Law and myself were Joseph’s enemies, and if they came in his way they

> and I thought I was watched.

Soby had told Brutus Marks his life was in danger then a bunch of guys
camped outside his house, which stoked these fears. He went and told
Francis Higbee, another of Jo’s opponents who supposed his father had
died by foul play by the prophet only a year prior, and Higbee told him
about the conspiracy. I’ll just let the document speak for itself.

> Francis Higbee told me, and a man in the east part of the town told
> me; and a man came from the other side of the river, and told the
> story to that man, as he said. Yesterday morning, Hyrum \[Smith\],
> Wilson Law, and William Law met in the street, and I told the story as
> before related.

This was how Marks tried to establish his credibility. Soby told him
about the Danite conspiracy and the night after the guys staked out his
house he told Francis Higbee, Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, and William
and Wilson Law about what he knew and the guys watching him the previous
night.

> Mayor: Did ever anybody tell you I directed you to be watched?
> 
> William Marks; No\!

Jo was attempting to establish distance between himself and the conduct
of his Danite policemen. Higbee and another man named George W. Crouse
were sent for. Crouse was a store owner where one of these conversations
happened. Crouse was also a Danite. The conversation included another
dog of Joseph Smith’s, Warren Smith, one of the leaders of the Nauvoo
police force and one of the most stalwart Danites in the secret cabal.

> Marshal went for Francis M. Higbee and George W. Crouse.
> 
> Leonard Soby sworn: On Sunday, 31<sup>st</sup> December last, I met

> said, “He (Marks) had better not cross my path when I am on duty.” I
> gathered the idea there was something wrong with brother Warren Smith.
> Do no recollect any person present.

Leonard Soby bore witness to this exchange and figured that Warren Smith
was on the warpath to get rid of Marks or Law by any means necessary.
But, like any good made-man, Warren Smith would never betray the
confidence of his boss because he’d sworn oaths of secrecy with penalty
of death.

> Mayor\[:\] Did Warren Smith or any other policeman give you to
> understand that I had authorized him to believe there was any

> 
> Did not say he had any instruction; said to Mr. Marks, “you have
> enemies.” My impression was that somebody had been to Joseph to make a

Of course, Jo had plausible deniability in all this because no Danite
would betray their oaths and tell on the stand what Jo had commanded
them to do. It was all just a misunderstanding.

> Thirty policemen—all who were present, sworn: Testified that General
> Smith had never given them any private instruction concerning the case
> before the council.

Just like with the hearing 2 days prior with William Judas Law, Jo made
a grand display with all the policemen in attendance that there weren’t
any secret oaths. These men knew exactly what their duty required, the
first rule of Danite club.

> Warren Smith said Soby asked his opinion who was the Judas. I said
> from rumor I would suspect William Law; does not believe he mentioned
> Marks’ name. My opinion was founded on rumor.

As we’ve seen countless times, when there was a rumor in Nauvoo it was
often founded in a nugget of truth. Now another guy is introduced, Isaac
Hill. Hill doesn’t seem to be a Danite, but may have just had some
insider knowledge about their existence. He was loyal, but wasn’t
totally on board with polygamy, which, of course, was scrubbed from the
published HoC and restored by Vogel’s source and text critical edition
of the HoC from which I’m reading this hearing.

> Brother Isaac Hill said brother Law was in a bad situation, was
> kicking; and if he did not mind, he would go over the board; if he

> mentioned spiritual wife system, \&c.** I understand a Brutus to mean
> a treacherous man. **Bro Hill did not believe in the spiritual wife
> system and Law did not believe in it.**

Once again, we see polygamy being scrubbed from the record by small
degrees and the lines historians draw between celestial marriage and
spiritual wifery are completely arbitrary, post-hoc, and done so with an
agenda to scrub Jo’s name of any wrongdoing. Next on the stand is George
W. Crouse, the storeowner where this conversation between Leonard Soby
and Warren Smith took place.

> George W. Crouse sworn: Does not recollect any conversation between
> Warren Smith and Leonard Soby at his store relative to the case in
> question; had a discussion about the duties of policemen.

As a businessowner in Nauvoo, it was best for Crouse to just stay out of
this regardless of what he knew. Crouse isn’t heard from again for the
rest of the hearing. Lost in the record, as always, is the subtext of
the conversation and an exact recounting of everything which was said.
Unfortunately we only have the transcription for W. W. Double-dub Phelps
to work with and he leaves out what led to the next point made, but it
hearkens to what transpired in the previous hearing. People were
generally concerned that the Nauvoo police force were patrolling the
street with loaded rifles. It put people on edge and was too similar to
martial law when the Nauvoo Legion would occasionally occupy the
streets. But, Nauvoo wasn’t in martial law at this time, so people
couldn’t see any justification for the police force to constantly walk
around with loaded rifles. A resolution was passed at the end of the
hearing we covered last week about William Judas Law, and the policemen
were required to hang up their rifles and only patrol with pistols.
Apparently, that still wasn’t good enough and caused more tension, but
John Taylor, second prophet of the Utah church, spoke in favor of the
practice.

> Councilor \[John\] Taylor said it was customary in all cities for
> policemen to go armed in time of danger.
> 
> Councilor \[Orson\] Hyde confirmed Councilor Taylor’s observation.

Next to speak is Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith and he has a fun little bit
of folklore to share.

> Councilor Hyrum Smith spoke. Told a story of the old Dutchman and the
> ox. Soby makes me think of an old Dutchman, who had an ox, the first
> animal he ever owned in his life, and he broke him to ride; the he

> the old man off. “Father,” said the son, “I did as you told me.”
> “Yes,” said the old man, “but you made too big a boo.”

This is an interesting and astute point Hyrum made, but I think it’s
important to see it from a larger perspective. Who is it that was making
too big a boo? Was it Soby who told Marks that his life was in danger
needlessly, or was it Jo who was making too big a boo out of what he
perceived to be threats? Look, a person with such a tenuous grasp on
power like Joseph Smith, it’s not uncommon for them to overreact to
something they see as a dire threat like William Judas Law going public
with an expose. Jo didn’t learn from this little tale because his
reaction to the Nauvoo Expositor, written by William Judas Law, was what
actually killed him. He didn’t go to Carthage Jail because of the
accusations in the Nauvoo Expositor, he went there because he committed
an act of tyranny and destroyed the printing press. The coverup was
worse than the crime and he died for the coverup. Jo was the guy making
too big a boo when he thought the ox was tame.

The town Marshal returned with Francis Higbee and he was called to the
stand to get his side of the story. Remember, at this time, Higbee was
wondering whether or not his own father had been taken out by the
Danites. Higbee would be one of the co-conspirators alongside William
Judas Law to publish the Nauvoo Expositor. It was important for him to
keep his own thoughts close to his chest because if he aired out
suspicions that Jo was orchestrating hits in Nauvoo, this is the
audience who wouldn’t listen to his cries and he’d be food for the
Mississippi catfishes before nightfall.

> Francis M. Higbee sworn: Have received the impression from rumor that

> subscribe to all things in the church, and there were some private
> matters that might make trouble; don’t know of anyone being in danger.
> No one told me the police had received any private instruction. Could
> not tell who he had received these rumors from.

It was hard for anybody to trust anybody else in this hearing. There
were two perceived sides. The prophet and his Danites, and those who
weren’t on the prophet’s side. Nobody could be certain where each other
was, especially when we had people playing both sides like William Judas
Law and Joseph H. Jackson, the guy who was sent to bust Pistol Packin’
Port out of prison and was still deeply infiltrated in the leadership
while actively writing his expose in secret at this time.

Next to take the stand was William Judas Law, apparently seeking an
explanation for why Warren Smith would tell Leonard Soby that if Judas
or Brutus crossed Warren’s path they’d be popped.

> William Law spoke: Said he had no personal feeling against Warren
> Smith. Some two or three years since he sued brother Warren, and
> stayed the suit, \&c.: was suspicious Warren Smith’s feelings might
> have risen from that source.
> 
> Councilor Hyrum Smith, Daniel Carn, Warren Smith, L\[eonard\] Soby,
> and William Marks addressed the council.

Unfortunately, the record doesn’t have anything more than this. They
spoke; nobody today knows what was said. After Judas Law spoke and these
guys all gave their piece, Jo took another opportunity to speak and
clear his name of any Danite conspiracy by playing dumb. Then he spoke
about the necessity of having a police force in Nauvoo, which was
apparently still up in the air.

> The Mayor spoke: said no one had come to him with tales about William
> Marks, to prejudice his mind against him: was totally ignorant of it.
> I said to brother Dunham, if any man approach my house with arms, or
> attempted to disturb my house, I wanted the police to take care of

> house or barn, or anybody’s house or barn, tell him to stand and
> inquire his business. I think it possible that some person has been

> as the police according to their instructions, had laid away their
> guns.

That last point basically claims that there may be some who are
imitating the police force and purposefully scaring the good citizens of
the city. The police force was necessary, but of course it normalized
the practice of having armed guys walking the streets which meant a
person could walk around with a loaded rifle and simply claim they were
a policeman without any check or balance. But Jo did say that William
Brutus Marks was basically overreacting. If somebody was camping outside
Jo’s house with guns at night, he’d call the police over to ask them
what’s up instead of thinking a conspiracy to take his life was afoot.
But when the people staking out your house are corrupt cops who you
think are going to kill you, it’s kind of tough to call the cops.
Sensing there was apprehension about Daniel Carns and Warren Smith, the
two radical Danites who were suspected of plotting to kill Law and
Marks, somebody proposed that they should be dropped from the police
“lest they scare somebody”. There was some deliberation, and that
passage was removed from the published HoC, but by the end of the
hearing they retained their leadership positions in the Danite police
force.

> **Proposed that Daniel Cairns and W\[arren\] Smith be dropped from the
> police if the council consent\[s\] lest they scare somebody.**

Then Jo had some explicit instructions to Warren Smith and Daniel Carns.
Of course he did; their actions nearly revealed to the whole council
that Jo had a secretive assassination squad. He never missed a beat when
it came to invoking the collective trauma of Governor Boggs and the
Missouri-Mormon War. Although, given the context of the hearing, this
almost sounds like an admission that a Danite was the one who pulled the
trigger on Boggs.

Then it was Brother John Taylor’s time to speak his piece of kool-aid
drunk propaganda.

> Councilor Taylor spoke. Thought the conclusion drawn up by brother

Yes, William Marks and Soby relaying an assassination conspiracy to
Marks, simply don’t have enough respect for brother Joseph and therefore
concluded that he wanted them dead. The next note is remarkable and it’s
even more remarkable because it was removed. William Brutus marks and
Francis Higbee, two of the primary dissenters and possible targets of
Danite assassination attempts, were dismissed from the special council.
It simply says they retired, but I think it’s more reasonable that they
had spoken their piece and were no longer seen as important to the rest
of the council proceedings. Why is it important? Well, when we read the
rest of the document, it seems like everybody left on amicable terms.
But, when we see that Marks and Higbee were no longer present for the
conclusion of the council, it takes on a much more clandestine and seedy
nature. When Jo takes the stand, it’s hard to tell if he’s gloating or
if he’s guarded and uncertain. He had more reason to be guarded and
uncertain. Always remember, we’re only reading the original document as
it was recorded by Double-dub Phelps. We don’t know what was actually
said, it was censored when it was initially recorded and it was censored
when sections were removed from the published HoC. Jo’s speech after
Marks and Higbee left leads me to believe that they actually gave much
more damning testimony than what the record reveals.

> **Marks and Higby retired.**
> 
> Mayor referred to Francis Higbee’s testimony; thought Francis Higbee
> had better stay at home and hold his tongue, lest rumor turn upon him
> and disclose some private matters, which he would prefer kept hid; did

Leave Francis Higbee to stand on his own merits has a lot of
implications. He no longer carries the blessing of the leadership. This
was Francis Higbee’s exile.

> There has been a system of corruption and debauchery which these
> rumors have grown out of, and the individuals who are the authors of

Okay, so it’s not that they didn’t want a police force, they didn’t want
the NAUVOO police force because it was so incredibly corrupt and a bunch
of them were Danites. Hey, I like to have cops, but if I thought every
cop driving around my community wanted to kill me because I’ve called
Joseph Smith a monster, I wouldn’t want that cop around\! As much as
this seems like a hearing about the utility of the police force, this
was actually a divisive hearing. This council, and William Judas Law’s
council on last week’s episode were really a dividing line being drawn.
Whose side are you on, the prophet’s or the side of the dissenters? Can
Jo trust you in his time of need or are you going to be a threat which
requires being dealt with?

> **H\[igh\] Policeman spoke.**
> 
> Alderman Orson Spencer spoke, approving the conduct of the police,
> **\[and\] in objection to dropping the two police mentioned by the
> Mayor.**
> 
> **C\[ouncilor\] Harris said the police were in the hands of the

> 
> **Gen\[eral\] Wilson Law spoke.**

This next passage is an interesting one. It is originally recorded as
General Wilson Law speaking about Jo and him being friends, but the
editors of the HoC inserted William Law instead of Wilson. This makes
sense given the content of his speech. William Law thought Jo was
prophet, but misguided. Wilson Law hated Joseph Smith and only
grudgingly stayed in town because all his worldly possessions and his
career were wrapped up in the Mormon empire. This speech more likely
came from William Judas Law than his brother, Wilson Law.

> Gen\[eral\]. Wilson \[William\] Law said. “I am Joseph’s friend—he has
> no better friend in the world; I am ready to lay down my life for
> him,” and upon that the Mayor and Gen\[eral\]. Wilson \[William\]
> Law shook hands.
> 
> **High policeman said the fire was kindled before Marks by some men
> from the North part of the city and not the policemen.**

Now the truth comes out, but without any details. The guys who camped
out were from up north and weren’t policemen. What did that mean? How
far north? Because the north end of town is the hill where all the most
wealthy members lived next to the temple under construction. The wealthy
markets and stores were up on the high side of town. But, much further
north on the Mississippi towards Fort Madison is where the river rats
lived. The river rats were basically Mississippi pirates who robbed and
plundered under the cover of nightfall and then they’d disappear in
canoes up the river. If any of them were caught or arrested, the Nauvoo
Municipal court system would simply let them walk. The river rats
operated with Jo’s blessing as long as they only took the property of
people Jo perceived as deserving of it. For example, the hearing last
week when Jo was mad because Norton was running a hemp farm instead of
investing in the JST Bible project, Norton’s hemp farm was problematic
because “the Lord had not blest them in the business, but sunk their
hemp in the Mississippi river”. That was probably Danite River Rats who
worked under the cover of night and destroyed the pot farm. So, if it
were the river rats who were actually camped outside William Brutus
Marks’s house that night, he SHOULD be terrified. There are a few ways
to interpret that passage, I’m not sure what’s most reasonable.

> **Gen\[eral\] Law spoke again \[and\] expressed of his good
> feelings.**
> 
> **Councilor \[W.W.\] Phelps \[said\]. Policemen have always had to
> learn their duty. \[He\] hoped no one would get up another tempest in
> a tea pot.**

A tempest in a teapot is such a great turn of phrase. I disagree that
this situation really was blowing things out of proportion, it seems
more like people complaining that there’s a tempest that’s about to run
through Nauvoo and the leadership telling them to quit overreacting.
Let’s be very clear, it was Jo’s corruption that killed him, and these
two hearings are symptoms of the problem. Jo didn’t die because he was a
prophet, he was assassinated because he was one of the most corrupt men
in American politics.

> **C\[ouncilor\] H\[yrum\]. Smith apologized—**
> 
> The ordinance concerning the forty policemen, read twice.
> 
> The Mayor objected to assuming the entire disposal of the police,
> beyond the definition of the ordinance.
> 
> **C\[ouncilor\]. Taylor though the difficulties with W\[arren\]. Smith
> and D\[aniel\]. Cairns was of a private nature, and did not belong to
> the council.**

That passage was also removed. If it was a private matter with Warren
Smith and Daniel Carns, why would somebody like William Marks be afraid
for his life? This is precisely why the due process of law is supposed
to exist, because sometimes people like Joseph Smith, a demagogue and
tyrant, push the system to the point of breaking. He didn’t operate by
the set of rules and ethics most of us follow. We saw last week that
there were different systems of law which people followed. There was
law, then there was the Law of the Lord; and the Law of the Lord was
whatever Jo wanted it to be. He was a king in a nation with no kings.
People don’t look kindly upon tyrants.

> Alderman George A. Smith said he could sleep with a fire near his
> house, if there were some of the police warming themselves by it, and
> he believed any honest man could do the same.

Clearly George A. Smith is either deliberately trivializing the issue,
or completely misunderstands why William Marks was afraid in the first
place. But we can’t ever trust George A. Smith to be intellectually
honest.

> **On motion of W.W. Phelps, voted that the 2 police be retained.**
> 
> The police received the thanks of the council.
> 
> **Bro\[ther\] Soby—said W\[arren\] Smith did not say he would pop a
> hole through him.—did not say anybody would pop a hole through him.
> \[He\] never heard such a thing.**

This final statement by Soby was clearly him reading the room and
understanding he didn’t have friends in the council. His denials of what
he’d stated earlier simply shows he knew that this battle was lost.

> The cross-examination and speeches are generally omitted.
> 
> Council adjourned at dusk for the want of candles.

It’s such a fascinating special council. The reasons we spent so much
time on just these two hearings in early January 1844 was because they
reveal exactly how corruption flourishes in the darkness. There was
absolutely no watchdog, no independent oversight, no check and balance,
no democratic process; he was anointed King over all of Israel and king
is the most fitting term.

In many ways, we’re lucky Jo called William Marks and William Law a
Brutus or a Judas at his right hand, because the nicknames fit perfectly
for both of these guys. From William Law’s perspective, he did betray Jo
by publishing the Nauvoo Expositor. This showed to the world and the
powers that be that Jo was who everybody suspected he was and needed to
be stopped. This was the greatest betrayal in Jo’s life from his own
right-hand man, and one of the most powerful men in Nauvoo at the time
and it was the inciting incident of his death in Carthage.

But, what about William Brutus Marks. Why is Brutus the fitting name for
him to wear? Marks’s betrayal of Jo didn’t happen immediately at his
death. Instead, William Marks was a well-liked guy in high leadership
positions in the church during the schism crisis and held a lot of sway
with the general Mormon public. He was a level-headed guy and his
stability was very appealing to thousands of people. He was one of the
primary opponents to polygamy as Bloody Brigham and the Quorum of
Apostles began absorbing power through the second half of 1844. In the
greatest backstab to Joseph Smith’s legacy, William Brutus Marks refused
to align with Bloody Brigham and the quorum of Apostles, instead
publicly declaring Hingepin Sidney Rigdon to be the rightful guardian of
the church until Joseph Smith III came of age. By mid 1846, William
Brutus Marks twisted the knife already placed in the back of Jo’s legacy
by joining James Strang’s movement and being named counselor to the
president. This move dragged a lot of Mormons with him to follow James
Strang as Rigdon became increasingly irrelevant in late 1846 and early
1847.

From the believing Salt Lake City Mormon perspective, William Marks
truly was a Brutus who betrayed the polygamous legacy of Joseph Smith.
After Strang’s assassination in 1856, William Marks became a central
figure in the Reorganization. A devoted friend to Emma and Jo 3.0,
William Brutus Marks was ordained a counselor in the RLDS church
presidency in April of 1863. If the Utah church was what Jo envisioned
and strived for his entire life, William Marks was the man to drive the
dagger into the back of the Mormon colossus. While he didn’t succeed in
killing the demon, he weakened it. His fealty and legacy are a source of
debate, but the point remains that Jo was right to be skeptical of
Marks’s loyalty to him in early 1844. Given Jo’s penchant for either
running from his problems or making his problems go away through brute
force, William Marks was also right to be afraid for his life. Anybody
with his social standing and moral compass was a grave threat to the
Mormon theocratic empire. Jo dealt with threats, and Marks fit the
categories those who deserve blood atonement. He certainly had denied
the fullness of the gospel, and shedding his blood was no problem
because he was no longer innocent.
