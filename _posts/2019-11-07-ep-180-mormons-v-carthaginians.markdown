Ep 180 – Mormons v. Carthaginians

On this episode, a fight breaks out between the Carthaginians and the
Mormons of Nauvoo. Olive Amanda Smith Fullmer filed an affidavit
charging her partner, Milton Cook, with bastardy (abandonment) and the
Mormon Sheriff, Horace Eldridge, is granted a warrant for Cook’s arrest.
When Eldridge arrives in Carthage, he’s confronted by the citizens and
unable to serve the warrant. He returns to Nauvoo and gathers a posse of
Nauvoo Legionnaires, including Stephen Markham, to descend on Carthage
and affect the arrest once and for all. The ensuing confrontation
creates chaos and pandemonium and the local media outlets battle it out
in print for determining what actually happened.

It was January 1844. Little snowflakes fell to the Mississippi before
disappearing into the vast body of moving water. Some of the snow
accumulated to about “four inches deep” which made for “Good sleighing”.
The Mormons in Nauvoo were largely held up in their homes near the
hearth to keep the cold from settling in their bones. Olive Amanda
Fullmer Smith, a bright-eyed 18-year-old girl who was born in Onondaga
County, New York and immigrated to Hancock County, Illinois as a
teenager, was about to give birth to a beautiful baby boy, Chauncy
Harvey Cook. Her midwife bustled about the house keeping young Olive
calm and comfortable, administering medicine, massaging her tired
muscles from the labor and keeping blood flowing to stave off the frigid
air coming through the cracks in the cabin’s logs.

Little Chauncy was a healthy boy when he was delivered; Olive was strong
and made it through the labor with the expert help of her midwife.
However, there was a problem. Olive’s partner, Milton Cook, a cavalier
and good-looking 22-year-old man, didn’t want to be a father. The two
had met a year earlier in Nauvoo and fell madly in love, however some
issues must have existed between the two. They soon ran away from both
of their families and the historical record doesn’t tell us if they ever
married or not, but little Chauncy Harvey Cook was the result of their
escapade. Apparently, Olive’s stepfather didn’t approve of Milton and
Olive’s marriage and in these Victorian times a father’s blessing held
the power in granting permission for marriage.

Regardless of whether or not Olive and Milton were married, when little
Chauncey was born, Milton Cook ran from his culturally-expected fatherly
duties. Olive swore out an affidavit against Milton charging him with
bastardy, the ye olde charge of abandonment. Olive’s affidavit was given
to a sheriff in Nauvoo by the name of Horace Eldridge, who carried it to
Carthage, where Milton lived, and attempted to arrest Milton on the
bastardy charges and bring him before the Nauvoo Municipal court. Milton
Cook was not a Mormon and really didn’t like Joseph Smith and his
criminal empire; he thought he’d be safe in Carthage from the Nauvoo
criminal justice system. He wasn’t wrong and a confrontation ensued.

Before we get to that confrontation, it’s a good idea to get some sense
of what the relationship between Carthage and Nauvoo was at this point.
Carthage citizens hated the Mormons. Carthage was the largest town in
Hancock county that wasn’t Nauvoo, meaning the citizens fell under the
jurisdiction of any politicians who were elected by the Mormon voting
bloc. The Mormons completely suffocated the political voice of Carthage.
Beyond that, the Mormons weren’t great neighbors and didn’t pay their
bills. Carthage citizens also fell under the jurisdiction of the
ever-expanding legal powers of the Nauvoo Municipal court system and
Legion. Not by any law or legal precedent, but simply by virtue of both
of those systems slowly growing since their inception.

In order to combat the expansion of the Mormon empire, the anti-Mormon
political party was formed in Carthage, Illinois in 1841 by Thomas Coke
Sharp and other concerned citizens from Carthage and the surrounding
cities. Carthage was literally the headquarters of the anti-Mormon
political party and where much of the anti-Mormon rhetoric was born
before Thomas Sharp published it in the Warsaw Signal.

Carthage had also harbored many fugitives from Nauvoo justice in the
past. Most prominently, when John C. Wreck-it Bennett resigned from
Mayor and began collecting affidavits to publish against Joseph Smith,
many of his days were spent in Carthage because it was the nearest city
to Nauvoo where he could be reasonably safe from Danites. Pistol Packin’
Porter Rockwell still confronted Bennett there in Carthage, but Bennett
remained safe.

Many people who will play into the weeks prior to, and following, the
Carthage assassination of Jo and Hyrum were residents of Carthage. Not
only does the assassination itself happen there, but most of the
prominent figures leading up to the assassinations, and those charged
with conspiracy afterwards, were from Carthage. Simply put, Carthage and
Nauvoo were enemies. Nauvoo considered Carthage to be the hotbed of
their persecution while Carthage considered Nauvoo to be the hotbed of
the overreaching Mormon empire’s power. Carthage didn’t consider
themselves subject to the legal powers of Nauvoo, which is fair because
the Nauvoo municipal powers were just that, municipal.

So, with Olive filing the affidavit against her partner, Milton Cook,
and the Mormon sheriff traveling from Nauvoo to Carthage to arrest
Milton put these conflicting powers at an impasse. Nauvoo empiric
overreach was an unstoppable force which met with the unmovable object
of Carthaginian hatred for the Mormons. Nothing would reduce these
tensions and the hands of Governor Thomas Ford were completely tied.
Milton Cook’s fleeing to Carthage to escape his fatherly duties put him
square in the crosshairs of this tension between cities.

Historian Merina Smith summarized the situation in the book Revelation,
Resistance, and Mormon Polygamy.

Indeed, these were not normal times. The chaos created by the Mormon
empire was something that regular American citizens had never dealt
with. The citizens of Carthage took any action by any Nauvoo police
officer or militiaman outside of the city of Nauvoo as an affront to
their own sovereignty and reacted harshly to Sheriff Horace Eldridge
coming into Carthage to serve the arrest warrant.

To be clear, Milton Cook, and the charge of bastardy against him, had
absolutely nothing to do with the citizens of Carthage. However, a
Nauvoo sheriff strutting into town and attempting to flaunt his
authority made it certain that the city took an interest in Milton Cook
and his opposition to the Mormons trying to bring him to justice.

So, in the first week of January 1844, Sheriff Eldridge set out from
Nauvoo on the 26-mile journey to Carthage with Olive’s affidavit and an
arrest warrant granted by Robert Bob the Builder D. Foster in hand.
Horace Eldridge arrived in Carthage on the sixth of January. He found
his target, Milton Cook, at Bartlett’s Grocery Store in Carthage. A few
of the Carthage citizens recognized Sheriff Eldridge as the Mormon
sheriff and made it known to him that he wasn’t welcome. When Eldridge
attempted to grab Milton Cook by the arm and take him out of the grocery
store, a group of Carthaginians quickly gathered.

Hard words were thrown at Sheriff Eldridge, but no real violence broke
out, just threats. The citizens of Carthage didn’t know why Eldridge
wanted Milton Cook, they just knew that a Mormon sheriff was trying to
arrest one of their friends and fellow citizens of Carthage. The
Carthaginians brandished firearms at Sheriff Eldridge. Milton Cook
himself pulled out his own pistol, pointed it at Sheriff Eldridge and
told him “he had loaded \[it\] for the purpose, and would make a whole
through the constable if he molested him, and swore he would not be
taken.”

At this point, Sheriff Eldridge knew if he further attempted to affect
this arrest surrounded by armed Carthaginian anti-Mormons, while his
target was also armed, he would forfeit his life. He decided it best to
return to Nauvoo with the arrest warrant unserved and come back to
Carthage with reinforcements.

When Sheriff Eldridge returned to Nauvoo, he told Jo and the leading
policemen of the city of the confrontation at Carthage. Stephen Markham,
one of Jo’s closest advisors and personal bodyguards and head of a
division of the Nauvoo police force, was quick to respond. Markham was
somebody you didn’t want to mess with. A long time ago we introduced
Stephen Markham to the storyline as Piggy-bank Steve because he was the
primary guy with the church’s purse when they were buying up all the
property in Illinois and Iowa during the Mormon resettlement following
the Missouri-Mormon War. Stephen Markham was so trusted by the prophet
that he was specially appointed to personally escort the Smith family
from Far West, Missouri to Quincy, Illinois during that exodus. Markham
was also Jo’s personal assistant when he was arrested in Dixon, Illinois
in spring of 1843, which would have resulted in Jo’s removal to Missouri
had Markham not ridden the 160 miles to Nauvoo and notified the Legion
of the prophet’s arrest. During the arrest itself, Markham attempted to
subdue Sheriff’s Wilson and Reynolds as they were handcuffing the
prophet, but he relented when Jo told him to stand down. Markham was
also a lieutenant colonel in the Nauvoo Legion.

All of that means that Stephen Markham stepping up to help sheriff
Eldridge make this arrest meant business. Markham gathered a posse
including Robert D. Bob the Builder Foster and 10 other guys. Come hell
or high water, this posse was going to arrest Milton Cook.

They left Nauvoo the morning of January 8, 1844 and arrived in Carthage
in the late evening; it was an entire day’s journey. They went to
Bartlett’s grocer, expecting Cook to be there as he was when Eldridge
alone tried to arrest him. As they entered the city, their presence
immediately put everybody on edge. The same people who’d rallied around
Cook just two days prior saw an entire posse of a dozen men enter the
city limits, undoubtedly up to no good in their eyes, and it was time to
draw a line.

The Mormon posse arrived at Bartlett’s grocer. 5 men stood at the door
of the grocer, they had 2 pistols, knives, and 2 rifles with bayonets
attached. Stephen Markham told the armed men that they were here for
Milton Cook and they intended to serve the arrest warrant.

The 5 men stood at the door with their weapons, ready to defend Cook.
Stephen Markham caught sight of the posse inside the grocer around Cook,
the anti-Mormons were twenty strong and Markham only brought 11 of his
buddies to the fight.

Markham, and another member of the Mormon posse, a guy named Eagle, got
in the faces of the guards and showed them the arrest warrant for Cook.
The Carthage posse refused to give up Cook. Then, Markham and a guy
named Eagle, stepped forward to enter the store and take Cook by force.
When they did this, one of the men with the bayonetted rifle thrust the
weapon at Markham. But, Markham, being an experienced member of the
Nauvoo Legion parried the attack with his hands, which sent the bayonet
stab away from him and straight toward Eagle. Eagle tried to deflect the
bayonet thrust and stepped to the side. The knife cut his hand and
thrust into his abdomen, but the sidestep made the blade glance off his
stomach leaving only a small cut and some torn clothing.

This aggression by the Carthaginian was met by the whole Mormon posse
pushing toward the door to defend Eagle and Markham. Another man in the
Carthage posse brandished his pistol and aimed it straight at the chest
of Eagle telling him he’d shoot if the man came any closer. A second
pistol came out which was pointed at Stephen Markham, but he was quick
on his feet and grabbed the gun out of the man’s hands before he could
pull the trigger. The Mormon posse continued to try and push into the
grocer. They were outnumbered and outgunned and Cook wasn’t going to
give up without his fellow Carthage citizens engaging in a fight. But
nobody wanted to pull the trigger. You see, the Mormon posse was
outnumbered and outgunned in this confrontation, but the underlying
tension in this standoff was the Nauvoo Legion. Sure, the legion wasn’t
here for this fight, but if the Carthaginians did anything to the Mormon
posse beyond threats and a few bayonet stabs, that would bring the whole
Nauvoo Legion down upon the city. The Mormon militia was looking for a
reason to be utilized and the Carthage mob protecting a fugitive was a
great excuse for the Mormons to march on this rival city.

This fight was bigger than 25 men yelling at each other and pistols
being brandished and pointed. This fight carried with it the weight of
3,000 soldiers and the end to Carthage life as the citizens knew it.
Milton Cook and some members of the posse realized this fight was
escalating and the end of it meant Carthage being razed to ashes before
the Nauvoo Legion salted the earth on which the city once stood. Milton
Cook and a few of the posse guarding him decided to slip out the back
door during the chaos and confusion. One of the Carthage posse told the
Mormon posse that Milton Cook isn’t here and their fight was in vain.
This released some of the tension as the catalyst for the fight was no
longer in the building. Where could he have gone? There wasn’t a town
nearby for him to run to and it was late in the evening anyway. The
apathy from the Mormons, weary from their travels, and the Carthaginians
drunk and not wanting to deal with the Mormon posse coalesced to
deescalate the tensions. Markham and Eldridge decided it would be best
to spend the night at the local Carthage tavern and attempt to arrest
Cook in the morning. He would certainly remain in the city and everybody
would be fresh to keep their heads cool and come to a reasonable
agreement.

The Mormon posse retired with the promise that this affair was far from
over.

The next morning, the posse again returned to Bartlett’s grocer
suspecting Milton Cook to be there. They were wrong. When they got to
the store, a few of the Carthage posse from the previous day told them
that Milton Cook had fled in the night and wasn’t even in town anymore.
The Mormon posse chose to check another common gathering place which had
a group of armed men gathered around it. This was another grocer owned
by Harmon T. Wilson, one of the two sheriffs who arrested Jo in Dixon in
June of 1843. What an interesting turn of events for this guy.

The Carthage posse had grown overnight. What used to be a mob of 20 men
armed with a couple pistols and rifles was now 50 men strong, armed with
“guns, bayonets, pistols, clubs, and other missiles.” Milton Cook was,
indeed, at Wilson’s store, guarded by these 50 men.

The Mormon posse pulled up to Wilson’s store where the Carthage posse
had all their weapons brandished and ready to use; all the tensions from
the previous evening were suddenly amplified by the larger numbers of
defending Carthaginians.

Sheriff Eldridge demanded Milton Cook in a raised voice with Stephen
Markham and the other 10 Nauvoo Legionnaires ready for a fight behind
him. Eldridge pushed past the Carthage mob and grabbed Cook by the
collar. This was a moment of tough decision for the Carthaginians. Do
they cede control of the situation, acquiesce to Eldridge’s authority
and allow their friend, Milton Cook, to be arrested, thus allowing the
Mormons to chalk this up to a win against the Carthage system of law?
What kind of a precedent does that set? Or, do they oppose Eldridge and
the Mormon posse and stand up to the ever-growing Mormon power, even if
fighting now results in the Nauvoo Legion marching into town ready for
war?

They chose the latter, let consequences be damned. As soon as Eldridge
grabbed Milton Cook, 8 men grabbed Eldridge and pried Cook out of his
hands. Stephen Markham stepped forward to assist his fellow brother in
the Nauvoo justice system. Seeing Markham go to help Eldridge, a
Carthaginian named Dr. Morrison pulled out his pistol and aimed it at
Markham. The whole crowd jumped into the fray. Morrison pulled the
trigger on his pistol, but Markham reacted quickly again and deflected
the shot from hitting him. The gun fired. The pistol ball grazed the
head of Zebedee Coltrin, a Mormon Danite from the Kirtland era, and
lodged into the ceiling.

This gunshot was a wakeup call and the Mormon posse halted their actions
for fear more guns may go off. The 3 Mormons who’d made their way
through the mob into the store and were trying to get Milton Cook under
control stopped what they were doing and reluctantly let go of the
prisoner. The fight was over without any serious wounds. The Mormons
were beat.

The Nauvoo posse pulled away from the storefront realizing, “it would be
impossible to take \[Cook\] without bloodshed, and consequently returned
home.” As they mounted their horses, one of the Mormon posse, possibly
Stephen Markham, parted with this terrifying reply, signaling to the
Carthaginians that they’d made a horrible mistake defending Milton Cook.
“\[We will\] return with the Legion, and take the prisoner, or lay the
town in ashes\!” The worst fears of the worst possible outcome of this
brawl were now realized by the Carthaginians, but of course this was the
result.

The posse made their way back to Nauvoo where Stephen Markham
immediately made an affidavit of his perspective of the events, which
was published in the Nauvoo Neighbor of January 10<sup>th</sup>. The
citizens of Carthage also sent word to Thomas Sharp, the editor of the
Warsaw Signal, turned Warsaw Message, soon to turn Warsaw Signal again,
the leading anti-Mormon paper, and he printed a small report on the same
day. From the content of the report it’s clear that conflicting stories
made their way to the respective propaganda outlets.

The Nauvoo Neighbor:

> We think that it is high time that prompt measures be taken to put a
> stop to such abominable outrages: if officers can be insulted in this
> manner, and the law violated with impunity, we think that we shall
> speedily slide back into the barbarous ages…
> 
> If such proceedings as those are cherished, fare well to our
> republican institutions; farewell to law, equity, and justice, and
> farewell to all those sacred ties that bind men to their fellow men.

The Warsaw Message in its usual tone of skepticism and seeking further
information:

> We learn that there was quite an excitement at Carthage yesterday, in
> consequence of the arrest of a citizen of that place, by a posse of
> Mormons from Nauvoo, on a charge of Bastardy. The citizens declare
> that the individual shall not be taken to Nauvoo for trial -- and were
> under arms in his defence. We do not hear that any fighting was done.
> The excitement ran high, and may yet result in bloodshed. We hear no
> further particulars. It is hoped that our citizens will exercise
> moderation in these scenes of strife -- and on all occasions, make it
> a paramount duty to support the supremacy of the law. Let others
> disobey the law, and receive the consequences; but the Anti-Mormon
> party should ever make the law their shield and their hope.

This was a tough situation. The arrest warrant for Milton Cook was
legitimate and Carthage was in Hancock County where the Nauvoo sheriff
had jurisdiction to exercise criminal justice. Robert D. Bob the Builder
Foster was a legitimate justice of the peace who signed the affidavit
from Olive Amanda Fullmer Smith in the first place and wrote the arrest
warrant based on her affidavit. The Mormon posse was operating under the
color of law. However, in so many instances, the Mormon criminal justice
system worked on behalf of criminals. The Nauvoo Municipal court had
shielded thieves, let murderers roam free, and had protected the
criminal kingpin Joseph Smith himself for nearly half a decade when he
was dead to rights under any normal system of law for the crimes he
committed in Missouri. The Carthaginians felt justified in opposing the
Nauvoo posse because they were tired of the constant scandals and
outrage Jo was putting them through daily. They were Americans beholden
to the American constitution and criminal justice code. Joseph Smith and
his cronies claimed they followed the same laws as every other American,
but such adherence had never been demonstrated. They lived under the Law
of the Lord and followed Jo’s rules. Jo made the laws, he made the
rules, and those who didn’t play by his rules suffered the consequences
of the legal system Joseph had demonstrated himself exempt from.

This wonderful paradox makes this scuffle between the Mormons and
Carthaginians so wonderfully interesting to me. For once, the Mormons
were following the law while the anti-Mormons were violating the due
process of the criminal justice system. That equation was flipped in
nearly every other circumstance which drew the cities together, but in
this unique case the Mormons happened to be on the right side of the
law.

This paradox was recognized by Thomas Sharp as more information about
the outrage trickled in and he continued to report on it. In an
illustration of remarkable restraint, the Warsaw Message called for a
meeting between the Mormons and Anti-Mormons to hash out what happened
during the fight and figure out if Milton Cook should face the law in
Nauvoo, or if Cook should remain in Carthage unmolested. Of course, the
editor of the Warsaw Message, Thomas Sharp, was still very clear about
drawing the line against the tyrant himself, merely calling for the good
citizens involved in the brawl to come to an understanding. Sharp gives
Mormons the benefit of the doubt that even they can be sensible about
this, even if Jo himself would never seek compromise.

> In view of these things, the question occurs to us, whether there is
> not some common ground, on which the two parties can meet. This is not
> for the hoary monster {Joseph Smith} who rules at Nauvoo; whose black
> heart would exult in carnage and bloodshed, rather than yield one iota

> that a majority even of his most firm supporters would prefer peace
> and quietness to rapine and violence. To all such -- to all \[who\]
> are not determined to rush headlong to destruction, in carrying out

>   
> As a means of bringing about so desirable a result, we respectfully
> suggest that a public meeting of all parties be called, to meet at
> Carthage on as early a day as practicable to take into consideration
> the grievances and their remedy. What say you, Fellow Citizens?

What say you fellow citizens? That was an open petition by Sharp to
receive all sorts of incredible letters from readers of the Warsaw
Message, some of which he was kind enough to print in subsequent
editions covering this “Great Excitement at Carthage”. I have to remark
on Thomas Sharp’s ability to dissociate the Mormons from Joseph Smith in
this and the following columns. Sharp hated Joseph Smith, but clearly
saw the Mormons collectively as otherwise rational people who’d been
victimized by Jo. To draw that line and refuse to villainize the entire
Mormon population was a laudable stance for Sharp to take, and he was
literally one of the founders of the anti-Mormon political party. It’s
not that people were anti-Mormon, they were anti-Joseph Smith; they were
anti-Tyrant.

The Warsaw Message continued its tirade against the Nauvoo Neighbor
concerning what happened during the brawl between the two posses.

What actually happened between the two groups is a subject of debate.
The sequence of events reported by Stephen Markham don’t necessarily
match with what the citizens of Carthage reported, but of course we
wouldn’t expect them to because both sides viewed themselves as the
correct party and the other as the aggressors.

The meeting to determine the facts and draft resolutions did happen
according to the request of the Warsaw Message. But it seems if any
Mormons did attend that they were few in number. The Warsaw Message of
17 January 1844 reports the general tone and the resolutions which were
passed at the meeting in view of the “Mormon Difficulties” resulting
from everything we’ve discussed so far.

Brief pause to talk about one of those names, Colonel Levi Williams.
Back on episode 171 we talked about Daniel Avery and his son being
arrested on horse thieving charges. Colonel Levi Williams was the member
of the Illinois state militia who executed that arrest and handed Avery
over to Sheriff Reynolds in Missouri where Daniel and his son were
imprisoned. Colonel Levi Williams is one of the most well-known
anti-Mormons of this Nauvoo era. He was one of the five men who stood
trial for the assassinations of Jo and Hyrum after the Carthage
shootout. He also figures heavily into the schism crises and the removal
of most Mormons from the state of Illinois in 1844-7. He was one of the
people completely fed up with the Mormons called to the committee to
draft the resolution resulting from this meeting, which reads in part:

> \[W\]hile the authorities of the city of Nauvoo have been continually
> passing ordinances in designation of the laws and constitution of the

> And while we have seen a growing disposition on the part of that

Essentially, resolved, that we’re tired of getting kicked around by the
damn Mormons. That’s what this is\! They agreed that they will stand
against the Mormons at all costs and form defensive bodies should any
Mormon threat come into Carthage. The collective mentality that created
these resolutions is the exact same mentality by the exact same people
that actually killed Joseph and Hyrum Smith only 6 months after this
meeting. That’s why this is so important. It’s not like the
Carthaginians just marched on the Carthage Jail where the men were
interred in a vacuum; they’d been dealing with the injustices of the
Mormon empire for years and were done.

It’s also important to recognize that these people clearly understood it
was Joseph Smith who was the problem, not the Mormons at large. The
resolutions and ordinances passed by the Nauvoo government had all been
done at the behest of, and for the benefit of, Joseph Smith. He was the
corruptor that was dragging an otherwise industrious and good people to
the depths of “blackguard… commissioned by Satan to vex and torment the
children of men”. Joseph Smith, as has been the case since we started
this podcast, was the issue here, not the beliefs of the Mormons.

The resolutions were designed to be defensive and immediately published
in the Warsaw Message. A few folks living in Carthage decided to answer
the editor’s call for input about the meeting and the fight which led to
the meeting with letters to the editor.

Signing himself as Hannibal is quite remarkable. From the Classical era,
Hannibal Barca was one of the most successful Carthaginian military
leaders to fight Rome during the Second Punic War. Somehow he
successfully crossed the Alps and infiltrated Italy and proceeded to
burn Roman cities in their homeland. He was so close to successfully
defeating the Romans over 400 years before the fall of the Western Roman
empire. But, unfortunately he failed in his military campaign, arguably
because he didn’t receive reinforcements from Carthage at crucial times
in his warpath, which eventually led to the fall of Carthage when the
Romans raided, pillage, and burned the city to the ground, leveling
every structure and salting the ground on which the city stood to ensure
it would never be inhabited again. This guy signing Hannibal was a
history deep cut, but given the mentality of the anti-Mormon
Carthaginians and the ever-expanding Mormon empire, it’s an interesting
name to invoke.

Sharp, or Gregg, one of the editors of the Warsaw Message, decided to
comment on this letter with a rare display of complete restraint and
trying to diffuse the situation while many citizens like this Hannibal
character were crying for blood. Once again, I applaud the editor’s
ability to separate Joseph Smith from his deluded followers. Jo was the
problem here and he was not a person to compromise with. The Mormons at
large, however, could be reasoned with; at least that’s what the editor
thought.

No compromise until they humble themselves and admit they’re wrong. If
that’s the mentality with which you approach conflict, nobody is going
to get anything done. This mentality leads to war and it seems clear
that many citizens of Carthage considered a war of extermination to be
the best answer to the Mormon problem. Once again, the Warsaw Signal
editor takes this citizen to task for their letter which seems to
advocate extermination.

The main takeaway from this interaction between the Mormons and the
citizens of Carthage is that this was a harbinger of what the future
held for these groups of people. Sharp saying that the verdict of the
American people is against those who resort to force to affect their
purposes simply cannot be further from the truth. We relish violence. In
the 19<sup>th</sup> century just as much today people are able and
willing to justify violence committed against other humans. The
tribalism and vilification of the other group in today’s episode is such
a fascinating microcosm of what humans always do to each other. This
interaction revealed human natures which transcend simple distinctions
like religious, class, or racial divisions. Whether it was the
Carthaginians and the Romans or the Carthaginians and the Mormons,
violence seemed like the only possible conclusion, and violence ended up
ruling the day.

In spite of people with cooler heads like Thomas Sharp trying to calm
tensions down by calling for a meeting for everybody to just sit down
and talk this out, cooler heads rarely prevail among those who desire
the bloodshed of their enemies. Sharp did the proper work of journalism
here. Instead of stoking the flames like the John Taylor at the Nauvoo
Neighbor, Thomas Sharp’s articles in the Warsaw Message were that of
calling for tolerance and understanding while reporting the Carthage
side of the conflict, while also recognizing the prevailing sentiments
of the vast majority of Carthaginians wanting the exterminate the
Mormons.

The groups didn’t want compromise, they wanted victory. Victory for
Carthage was no longer having to deal with the Mormons as terrible
neighbors. Victory for the Mormons was mortal deification of their great
and wonderful leader as king of the world. Those two concepts simply
don’t work together and compromise seemed just as impossible for the
people living through this as it does for historians looking back at the
conflict. Unfortunately, the people in power at this time were largely
impotent. Governor Thomas Ford had done all he thought he could do to
deescalate the conflict and have Jo answer for his crimes and it didn’t
work. How could he step in without calling in a militia and even further
escalating the conflict? There simply wasn’t a human system in place
that could handle the conflict between the Mormon and the Carthaginians.
As much as we will relish the day when Jo meets his great demise on this
podcast, and as much as the people at the time who hated the prophet
relished his death, Jo’s death didn’t actually solve anything. That
singular act of violence, within the context of escalating tensions,
didn’t actually make the world a better place for most of the people
affected by Mormonism. In many ways, Jo’s death was the catalyst for so
much more suffering and pain for tens of thousands of people.

Violence begets violence, and those involved rarely listen to a logical
observer telling everybody to just calm down. If we don’t understand our
history, we’re doomed to repeat it.

Big announcement, our updated paper on the Smith-entheogen theory is
finally online.
