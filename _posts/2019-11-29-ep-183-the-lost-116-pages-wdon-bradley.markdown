Ep 183 – The Lost 116 Pages w/Don Bradley

On this episode, we sit down with Don Bradley, author of a
recently-released book covering what we know about the lost 116 pages of
the Book of Mormon. Don has been researching this topic for the last 15
years and writing about it for the last 2; now his research is compiled
into his book “The Lost 116 Pages”. What can we know about a manuscript
which as been lost for nearly 2 centuries? What sources has Don used to
inform his speculation of the contents of that manuscript? What missing
puzzle pieces of the Book of Mormon could be filled by the manuscript?
Find out the answer to hardly any of these questions by listening to our
discussion, but find out the answer to all of these questions by
purchasing his book\!
