Ep 184 – The Power of a Mormon POTUS

On this episode, we discuss the continued growing tensions between the
Mormon and non-Mormon settlements in Illinois in early 1844. The Nauvoo
City Council renews its effort to get an ordinance passed through the
state legislature from Dec. 1843 which claimed Nauvoo to be a sovereign
territory as well as the Nauvoo Legion to be a federally-recognized
militia. How did they work to lobby this through the State legislature?
By harping on the same persecution narrative resulting from the 1838
Missouri-Mormon conflict. This dead horse keeps on giving. Eventually,
Governor Thomas Ford steps in to try and cool things down. The
unsatisfied Warsaw Signal prints his letter with their commentary and Jo
prints a concession in the Nauvoo Neighbor. Thomas Ford’s History of
Illinois (1854) reflects on this complicated time when Jo decided to run
for POTUS.

Tensions were high between the Mormon and non-Mormon settlements in
Hancock County, Illinois of early 1844. We’ve been discussing this
extensively for many episodes because this is an accumulating effect
that will continue to more heavily influence our timeline as we edge
ever closer to the shootout in the Carthage Jail in a few short months.

We should note that it’s not just with retrospect we can see these
tensions building; they were felt quite prominently at the time and some
small methods were taken to relieve a little of the pressure. Jo called
a meeting of the city council to review some of the ordinances they’d
passed which were causing the citizens of Carthage and Warsaw to be so
infuriated by the Mormon overreach of power. From the Vogel HoC 6:233

> Monday \[Feb\] 12.—I sat in the city council, and recommended the
> repeal of the ordinances entitled “An extra ordinance for the extra
> case of Joseph Smith,” “An ordinance to prevent unlawful search or
> seizure of persons or property, by foreign process, in the city of
> Nauvoo,” and “An ordinance regulating the currency,” and they were
> repealed accordingly. The memorial to Congress, passed Dec. 21, 1843,
> was again read, and signed by the councilors, aldermen, mayor,
> recorder and marshal.

> Amen.”

The Memorial to Congress passed Dec. 21, 1843, is quite a remarkable
document. Let’s read a bit of it and discuss so we get an idea for what
Jo instructed Orson Pratt to take to various Illinois representatives to
make the case for Mormon exceptionalism.

HoC 6:147

And believe it or not that was just a preamble to passing an ordinance.
This ordinance stated in Section one that Nauvoo was to be treated not
as a city or township, but as a territory like Iowa or Oregon at this
time. Section 2 allowed the mayor of Nauvoo, Jo, to call upon the POTUS
to “call to his aid a sufficient number of United States forces,” for
anything he needed like repelling mobs, attacking Missouri, you know
whatever Jo wanted to do that day. Section 3 was the provision which
required the federal government to comply with the other sections and
then section 4 made it so the Nauvoo Legion would fall under the
regulations of the United States militia and also receive pay the way
any other state-sanctioned militia would, meaning from state tax revenue
instead of from the Nauvoo city tax revenue.

This was what was reread in the council of February 12, 1844 as Jo was
making more political power moves after his nomination as candidate for
President of the United States. It was read and approved of by the high
council in addition to repealing those other acts that they probably
assumed were redundant with the ordinance that was passed back in Dec of
43 that we just read. Three days after that council, an article was
published in the Times and Seasons, the Mormon propaganda arm in Nauvoo,
titled “Who shall be our next President?”

The office of president, sure, was powerful. However, in this age
approaching the mid-1800s, it was the Legislative branch with the real
power. Marbury v. Madison and judicial review had only been adjudicated
just a few decades prior and the Supreme Court was finally beginning to
come into its own concerning its role and power in the government.
George Washington was a powerful first president but the office of
president was still very much in flux concerning how much power the
president really had or if it was a more ceremonial position. Executive
orders were almost unheard of and used only in incredibly extenuating
circumstances. Andrew Jackson had pioneered Executive Orders to override
the legislative branch and he’d signed 12 before he stepped down. The
next after him was George Washington with 8 executive orders. It wasn’t
until Ulysses S. Grant that the first president broke over 100 executive
orders, and some of society’s most beloved presidents ruled with
thousands of executive orders with Franklin D. Roosevelt topping the
charts at 3,728 in his 12 years. My point is, a president wasn’t a king,
and a president never has been a king. The position of president is
enticing, but very few presidents are actually the movers and shakers
who get politics done, especially in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The
real power was in the Congress, Senate, and with Governors of states
because states had a much greater level of power compared with the
federal government at this time. So, Jo vying for POTUS here was in many
ways either ceremonial, or a misdirected pursuit of power. Or maybe it
was a pursuit of power that was properly directed because getting
elected to POTUS would provide a great deal of marketing to legitimize
Mormonism as a viable national religion with over 10,000 adherents and
one third of the federal governing power under Jo’s control. Regardless
of the real intentions driving his campaign, Jo’s pursuit of the oval
office was beginning to gain some steam now that it was a month
underway. Pieces like this printed in the Times and Seasons became more
frequent throughout 1844. Let’s tune back in to see Who shall be our
next President.

> But if he prostrates his high and honorable calling to base and
> unworthy purposes; if he makes use of the power which the people have
> placed in his hands for their interests to gratify his ambition, for
> the purpose of self-aggrandizement or pecuniary interest; if he meanly

> him, debases the nation in the eyes of the uncivilized world and
> produces misery and confusion at home. “When the wicked rule, the
> people mourn.”

That’s all very legitimate, but surprising because all those accusations
of self-aggrandizement, gratifying his own ambitions, panders with
demagogues, pecuniary interest; all of those could easily be pointed to
as reasons why Jo was running for POTUS in the first place. I suppose
just like with all politics, if you call others out for doing what you
do, you somehow look like the hero. How dare that candidate take
millions of dollars from big oil lobbyists?\! When both candidates have
taken money from the same group. It’s a tried and true method of running
political campaigns. You can’t accuse me of this stuff if I already
accused you of it. The next section brings in a personal touch.

Jo certainly got a lot of mileage out of the Missouri-Mormon war and
expulsion. That same persecution narrative persists to this day. 2 years
of suffering for over a century and a half of persecution complex
radicalizing members is a fantastic return on investment. We’ve been
over it a few times, but the Mormons had legitimate grievances and the
State of Missouri had acted improperly in dealing with the Mormon
problem. The Mormons had also acted improperly by raising their own
militia and aggressively attacking Missouri troops, raiding supply
trains and stealing state-militia armaments, and pillaging non-Mormon
towns. Nobody was in the right during the whole conflict, as is the case
with nearly any conflict between two groups of people. But what this
really shows is Jo’s own personal animus in his bid for the presidency.
He wanted Missouri to pay for what he saw as wrongs committed against
him and his people. He wanted to be president to make Missouri pay. He
wanted the Green Mountain Boys to join with the Nauvoo Legion to make
Missouri pay through blood or gold. It was all personal anger he held
against Missouri, and that animus clearly fueled his campaign.

This is poisoning the well. We were treated so terribly by the President
and the government, how long until all of you fellow Americans are
similarly treated? It’s an interesting tension Jo was going for. To make
people fear the impotence of the government while simultaneously fearing
for their own safety because of that impotence sets the reader up to
look for what solution the rest of the article will propose. We know
that solution is electing Jo, but he’s become so expert at selling the
fear before the solution and this is the fear portion of his persuasive
techniques. Now that he’s invoked the collective trauma the Mormons
experienced in Missouri, harnessed their fears, he opens the door for
the solutions. First, the solutions the powers that be would have the
people choose.

Neither Henry Clay or Van Buren are possible candidates, what are we as
Mormons to do this coming election year?\! Jo is expert at harnessing
fear in these public declarations, but he’d only spoke of the known
fears of the Mormons. There was another place he could yet tap into that
was an infinite well of fear, the great unknown fears.

This is almost Lovecraftian in invoking fear of the unknown. Van Buren
is not only a terrible candidate for us Mormons to support because he
didn’t help us when we were grieved from the Missouri troubles, but a
little birdie told us that if he’s elected, he’ll do us even greater
harm by another extermination and cleanse the sullied reputation of
Missouri for what they’ve done to us. Human imagination is far more
powerful than anything physical a human might experience and Jo left to
the reader’s imagination the greater part of this fearmongering to give
even more weight to how terrible Van Buren was.

Either of these candidates will spell our demise as a people, fellow
Mormons, no solution exists except for the one I'm about to provide.

Now to answer some of that fake news that’s been spread about the
Mormons.

> Gentlemen, we are not going either to “murder ex-Governor Boggs nor a

This paragraph was actually quite genius in how it was worded. All those
quoted headlines from papers were obviously perceived as fake news and
propaganda by the average Mormons and with all those headlines put
together in one paragraph it strains credulity that any of them might be
true because they’re all so outlandish by themselves. What’s interesting
though, is that basically all of them were true. The attempted murder of
Lilburn Boggs is most reasonably interpreted as a Mormon retaliation for
their extermination from the state. Murdering people for not giving them
his money, while that is a bit simplistic it wasn’t wholly inaccurate.
People who didn’t pay tithing when the leadership knew they had means to
pay it basically owed money to the mafia. Walk on water, I’m not sure if
that’s referring to a specific story or not but there was some
contemporary propaganda which circulated about Jo telling people he’d
walk on water and they discovered planks of wood just under the surface
which, when removed, allowed the prophet to sink into the river he
promised he’d be able to cross. I spoke to historian Dan Vogel about
this story and he considers it folklore, but it isn’t entirely
impossible and could be what this paragraph was referring to
specifically. Defrauding the poor of their property was literally what
Jo had been doing since day one of his church and he had sent Pistol
Packin’ Porter Rockwell, the destroying angel of Mormonism, to track
down John C. Bennett when he fled Nauvoo for Carthage and was collecting
affidavits from high-ranking members and spiritual wives of the prophet
in Nauvoo. So… basically everything in that paragraph was cobbled
together to reveal how preposterous such propaganda was; how fake the
fake news can get. But, like all of it, almost every word in those
headlines was true which shows just how genius it was for the paragraph
to be crafted the way it was. If somebody reading this, especially
believing Mormons, don’t believe one of those headlines, they’d
subconsciously loop all those headlines together as the same fake news
and wouldn’t give any of those rumors or stories any credence. To any
non-Mormon reading this, it could sound quite reasonable to understand
the case the article is making; that all of these were just devised by
demagogues to gain political capital by making the Mormons their
whipping boys. Absolutely genius that bit.

When we tease apart each constituent piece of this article it reveals a
level of expert coercion which Joseph Smith wielded to incredible ends.
He had to be good at these subversive persuasion tactics or he wouldn’t
be a good religious leader. He proposed what the issue was, told the
readers what to fear, told them what they needed to see as the real crux
of the issue, answered accusations frequently levied against the
Mormons, then left their imaginations to conjure a deeper fear than
words could ever describe, then told them the solution to all “our motto
from henceforth will be GENERAL JOSEPH SMITH”. What an absolute
masterclass of religious and political persuasion tactics.

This article in the Times and Seasons was widely circulated and made
many who were otherwise unaware of Jo’s presidential campaign wholly
aware that he considered himself a reasonable contender. There was,
however, a major chink in the Nauvoo armor that had to be dealt with. If
Nauvoo and the Mormons were to put on a good face for the nation to
consider Joseph Smith electable as President of the United States, their
greatest threat in that contrived façade was the towns nearest Nauvoo
who hated the Mormons; the anti-Mormon political party. Now, remember,
the anti-Mormon political party was formed for the sole purpose of
combatting the growing power of the Nauvoo empire since mid-1840. Thomas
Coke Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal, was one of the founders of the
anti-Mormon party. This wasn’t a party formed to oppose Mormonism in
general, it was explicitly formed to fight Mormon political power and
the overt intermingling of church and state in that little fiefdom on
the Mississippi.

Warsaw and Carthage were the two hotbed cities of anti-Mormonism. Warsaw
was headquarters of the anti-Mormon political party and where the Warsaw
Signal was published by Thomas Coke Sharp. Carthage was the county seat
and the location to which fugitives from the Mormon empire would flee
when their lives were in danger. Carthage was one of the only cities in
Hancock county where Mormon leadership couldn’t exercise their
Nauvoo-based power with impunity.

Tensions were constantly rising between the anti-Mormons in Carthage and
Warsaw and the Mormons in Nauvoo. With the Daniel Avery being arrested
for horse-theft and taken to Missouri back in episode 171, to the Milton
Cook affair resulting in a brawl between Mormon and Carthaginians in
episode 180, the resulting town meetings of the anti-Mormons and Mormons
passing competing resolutions against each other was reaching a
fever-pitch. Both groups had put forward these competing resolutions and
forwarded them to Governor Ford of Illinois.

The Mormon resolutions basically amounted to them being able to exercise
their sovereign authority with the Nauvoo municipal police force and
court system and opposing any encroachment of any other legal system to
further insulate Jo from arrest and extradition to Missouri. The
anti-Mormon resolutions basically amounted to hold themselves in
readiness at all times to march at a moment’s warning to oppose the
Nauvoo Legion, to “resist every oppression that may be attempted to be
imposed upon us… by the authorities of Nauvoo, at the point of a
bayonet,” and to organize people in the surrounding towns into militias
to oppose the expanding Nauvoo Legion. You see… these competing
resolutions couldn’t exist in the same county in neighboring towns at
the same time.

The Warsaw Signal and Nauvoo Neighbor continued to exchange blows.

After receiving copies of all these resolutions and reading all the
papers published about these rising tensions, Governor Ford decided to
step in.

it, but not without their own commentary.

It's tough to tease out of that article, but the editor of the Warsaw
Signal, Thomas Coke Sharp, was making somewhat subtle insinuations about
Thomas Ford’s political jeopardy with the Mormons. He was heavily
beholden to the Mormon bloc, which made him treat any situation with
them with kid gloves; especially when Jo was arrested in Dixon in June
of 1843, which we discussed on episodes 144-47. Jo’s own posse of Nauvoo
Legionnaires arrested the sheriffs who had Jo under arrest and they
sorted the whole thing out in the Nauvoo Municipal Court. Thomas Sharp
made a good point that when Jo flaunted the laws during that whole
debacle, that was the perfect time for Governor Thomas Ford to exercise
his executive authority but he just sat on his own hands and Jo got
away, which allowed him to successfully challenge his later arrest in
the Springfield court a few months later on the basis of double
jeopardy. That line in there where Sharp says:

“We do not impugn the motives of his Excellency, in refusing to enforce
the law by Executive power. We believe that he acted from the honest
dictates of his judgment and we have an opinion of our own limitations
to his power in the premises, and we will not, from motives of delicacy,
hesitate to avow it.”

Motives of delicacy don’t allow them to say that Governor Ford is
coopted by the Mormon political machine, but that’s what was implied.
And yet, nobody was really happy with his performance as Governor
because of the complexity of the issue and his lack of decisiveness and
deliberate action when outrages with the Mormons occurred.

Thomas Ford wrote about this time in his History of Illinois published
in 1854 and his first-hand observations are quite remarkable even though
they’re written through the lens of reflection instead of contemporary
writing. I’ll let the Governor speak for himself.

Thomas Ford wrote this after he’d suffered political death with how he’d
handled the Mormon problem in Illinois and there were very few Mormons
even left in the state. He was relatively antagonistic but he also had
the vantage point of being governor and needing to view the issue from
all angles of all his constituents. It should be noted that Ford didn’t
take a hands-off approach to the Mormon issue the way Lilburn Boggs did
in Missouri. He was actively engaged in letter exchanges and personal
meetings with members of both sides of the conflict and he acted in his
best judgment when the situation was impossibly complicated with no real
winning scenario for any of the involved parties.

If it’s any consolation, when Ford’s letter and Sharp’s commentary were
published in the Warsaw Signal, Jo wrote an op ed to be published in the
Nauvoo Neighbor which was highly uncharacteristic; you’ll see what I
mean. Here’s the full letter taken from the Vogel HoC 6:241-2

> To the Editor of the *Neighbor*:--
> 
> Sir:--I wish to say to you, as there seems to be a prospect of peace,
> that it will be more love-like, God-like, and man-like, to say nothing
> about the *Warsaw Signal*.
> 
> If the editor breathes out that old sulphurous blast, let him go and
> besmear his reputation, and the reputation of those that uphold him,
> with soot and dirt; but as for us, and all honest men, we will “act
> well our part, for there the honor lies.”
> 
> We will honor the advice of Governor Ford, cultivate peace and
> friendship with all, mind our own business, and come off with flying
> colors, respected, because in respecting others, we respect ourselves.
> 
> Respectfully, I am, JOSEPH SMITH

In a rare showing of concession, Jo decided to deescalate the situation
and let the Warsaw Signal alone… for now, at least. It seems, from the
wording of the letter, that Jo essentially thought that if he backed
away from the conflict, people would see any further aggression in the
mix as a result of unwarranted attacks by the Anti-Mormons in Carthage
and Warsaw. Besides, Jo had bigger fish to fry, he was running for
President after all. He wasn’t wrong, but wasn’t totally right. This
concession didn’t put all the tensions between the Mormon and non-Mormon
communities to rest to any noticeable degree, it was merely a single
statement to the contrary amid a cacophony of escalation and arrogance
from Jo and the Mormon leadership. Ford put it well in his history when
he said: “\[Joe Smith\] became emboldened by success. The Mormons became
more arrogant and overbearing.” When they overstepped their rights and,
according to Sharp and many other media commentators of the day, “had
set at defiance the Laws of the State,” they were merely enjoying the
liberties of every good American citizen. Whenever persons in proper
authority attempted to roll back those outrages and challenge the Mormon
empire, it was “unparalleled persecutions and cruelties, inflicted upon
us and upon our constituents by the constituted authorities”.

It’s a sense of religious entitlement and supremacy held by many
religions, not just Mormonism. We can see how this plays out in
Mormonism as a microcosm of how American religions operate and it’s a
formula which holds true for all American history. Churches don’t have
to follow the rules everybody else does and it’s clear the Anti-Mormons
in Carthage and Warsaw were just as outraged about Mormonism enjoying
religious exemptions from laws the way we are when Mormonism today
covers up sex abuse, accrues 100 billion dollars of ill-gotten wealth
off the backs of tax payers and tithe-paying members struggling to feed
their families, while never paying taxes or reporting any of that wealth
or income to any government agencies; and then cry religious liberty
when we say tax the churches. It’s entitlement of the worse kind. Not
entitlement people may expect if we someday get universal health care
like every other industrialized country, that’s a misappropriation of
the term used to smear an aspect of the progressive movement. This is
entitlement of the religious exceptionalism flavor and it’s killing our
society today; we should be just as furious as the old citizens of
Carthage and Warsaw for these outrages, whether they’re committed by Jo
Smith or Musty Rusty Nelson.

Congrats to v4c
