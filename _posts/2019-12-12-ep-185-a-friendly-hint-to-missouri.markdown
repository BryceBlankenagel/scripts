Ep 185 – “A FRIENDLY HINT TO MISSOURI”

On this episode, Joseph Smith’s presidential campaign is ramping up\! Jo
nominates James Arlington Bennet for his Vice-Presidential candidate,
White-out Willard Richards drafts a letter to Bennet, notice is printed
in the Nauvoo Neighbor, and a retraction is published the following
week. A special conference is called to preach to 8,000 Mormons about
politics, the campaign, and the Mormon expansionist agenda. Jo picks a
few of his dissenters out of the crowd and grand-stands about them being
enemies, preaching about how he will “use up” those who oppose the
mission of the church. Construction on the Nauvoo Temple and tithing are
emphasized. Bloody Brigham Young makes a speech about not filing legal
complaints when wrongs are committed against you. An exploratory group
is formed and armed to the teeth to venture into the wilds of Texas and
Oregon for the next Mormon settlement and staging ground. A “Hint” is
sent to Missouri and the Missourians in St. Louis start to get uneasy
about a President Joseph Smith.

Joseph Smith’s presidential campaign was beginning to occupy an
increased amount of the time of the prophet and his subordinates. John
Taylor had written and published the pamphlet “General Smith’s Views of
the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States” which was
published on 7 Feb 1844 in the Times and Seasons as well as printed as a
standalone document. This was his proclamation to the world that he’d be
running for President and set out his political views and general
platform. We’ve read through it on the show back on episode 166 as we
entered 1844 and forecasted some major events of the year. This pamphlet
was widely circulated, so widely circulated that, in fact, “Fifteen
hundred copies of my “Views” out of press.” Was recorded by Quilliam
Claypen in Jo’s journal for 24<sup>th</sup> Feb 1844.

John Taylor and White-out Willard Richards were in full swing running
the Mormon propaganda machine with the Times & Seasons, Nauvoo Neighbor,
and special pamphlets like Jo’s “Views”. The History of Joseph Smith was
a regular column printed in the Times & Seasons, which was recognized by
a very curious person who’s been completely absent from our timeline
since episode 43- the Red Sermon episode during early 1838 in Missouri.
This man was John Goebbels Whitmer. For new listeners or people who may
not recall, John Whitmer was one of the eight witnesses of the Gold
Plates that supposedly provided the source-text for the Book of Mormon.
Jo and Oliver Cowdery, or Ollie Cowdung as we call him… I’m not proud of
that one… moved to the Whitmer farm in 1829 to finish writing the Book
of Mormon where John Whitmer acted briefly as scribe for the pages when
Ollie’s hand needed a break. John Whitmer was one of the earliest
members of the church and was ordained an Elder, an incredibly
privileged position at the time, sometime in June of 1830, less than 2
months after the church was formed. Why the NaMo nickname of Goebbels
Whitmer? Well the Whitmer family were first-generation German immigrants
and John Whitmer was given an early revelation which was printed as the
Book of Commandments chapter 50 in which he was to “keep the church
record and history continually,” making John Whitmer one of Jo’s
earliest propaganda ministers. If you don’t know where the name comes
from, google Josef Goebbels and the picture should come into focus.

From that time forward, John Goebbels Whitmer was no longer just a
scribe for the church’s revelations and the JST bible project, but an
active historian for the church. He began taking contemporary notes for
what he witnessed and writing contextualizing history surrounding
revelations he was sent from the HQ in Kirtland as he was set up in the
church presidency in Missouri where his older brother, D-Day David
Whitmer was president. Well, John Goebbels Whitmer continued keeping
that history throughout the entire 1830s. When Jo and Rigdon were forced
from Kirtland to Ohio fleeing legal troubles and schisms in Kirtland, an
inquisition was held against the Whitmers, William Wines Double-dub
Phelps, and Ollie Cowdung. They were all excommunicated and told they
needed to leave town in 48 hours or the Danites would be knocking on
their doors.

John Goebbels Whitmer faded into obscurity from that time forward as he
remained in Missouri during the entire Missouri-Mormon conflict and had
no reason to flee with the Mormons across the Mississippi to Illinois.
However, he still had his personal history notes in his possession which
he’d taken by commandment from God.

Why is this relevant? Joseph Smith was forcing his way further into the
public light in 1844 with his presidential campaign. There was a lot of
so-called anti-Mormon headlines in national news which was reporting on
the latest scandals coming from the Kingdom on the Mississippi. Jo’s
story needed to be known across the nation and the Atlantic Ocean so
people wouldn’t be scared of the fanatical religious sect and their
modern-day Mahomet. As the John C. Wreck-it Bennett meltdown was
infecting the Nauvoo empire, the project was begun to publish and
propagate Jo’s personal history as far and wide as the newspaper circuit
would take it. White-out Willard Richards, Jo’s appointed historian and
propaganda minister to replace John Goebbels Whitmer, was in the
constant process of collecting and sorting documents to construct Jo’s
history which we read from today as the history of Joseph Smith and the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the History of the
Church. A small snapshot of it is included in every Mormon scripture
book as the Joseph Smith History.

As a candidate for the presidency, Jo’s personal life and past would
come under extreme scrutiny so the Times & Seasons was careful with what
it printed. Copies of this published History of Joseph Smith must have
made their way down to Missouri where John Goebbels Whitmer was living
and he thought, Nauvoo sounds like a good place to live and I have
something of value the leadership may want, all my notes. Why don’t I
send a letter to my ol’ friend and co counsellor in the Missouri
Presidency, Double-dub Phelps, and see if he’d trade some Nauvoo land
for my history notes, maybe they could use my notes for their JS history
project and I could get a sweet plot of expensive Nauvoo land out of the
deal.

Here’s White-out Willard Richards’s reply to John Goebbels Whitmer’s
proposition. Whitmer didn’t even write the letter to Richards to begin
with, he didn’t even like Richards, so this reply had an extra sting to
it:

> records, and a book containing some of the early history of the

> Day Saints.

John Goebbels Whitmer wrote that letter to his old friend, Double-dub
Phelps in hopes of getting some valuable Nauvoo land he could either
live on or sell for a profit. What the church did with his history
notes, I don’t think he much cared. Suppress, burn, publish, it probably
didn’t matter to him. Almost 2 months with no reply and then the person
who finally got back to him was somebody he didn’t like, White-out
Willard Richards, and Richards made a statement by saying we’ve already
covered everything that little notebook you have includes so your work
was for nothing and then signed it with his title, which used to be held
by John Goebbels Whitmer, “Recorder and Historian for the whole Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,” which is VERY uncommon for
Richards to end his letters with.

This was a slight at Whitmer and his proposition, but it ended up being
for the best for us today. John Goebbels Whitmer continued adding to his
history and taking notes of what caught wind in the national media about
the Mormons and then published his book in 1847, 3 years after Jo and
Hyrum’s deaths and the same year the majority of the Mormons were headed
towards either Beaver Island with James Strang or the Great Basin with
Bloody Brigham. Had that history been traded to the church leadership at
the time, it may never have surfaced and the greatest resource
historians have for the early Kirtland era of the church might be burned
or suppressed to this day. Of course, supporters of the show at
patreon.com/nakedmormonism get access to the NaMo Book Club where we
read through Whitmer’s book top to bottom with commentary.

This event plays into the larger picture of Jo’s history as he pushed
himself further into the public light. It wasn’t just in the Times &
Season and other local Illinois newspapers, or even that national
newspaper syndicates that Jo was burning up more media oxygen, his Views
on the President pamphlet was being sold across the nation and Jo even
told White-out Willard Richards to send copies to “the President and
Cabinet, Supreme Judges, Senators, Representatives, principal newspapers
in the Untied States, (all the Governors,) and many postmasters and
individuals. In all about 200.” Jo wasn’t just stating his Presidential
platform to popular media but to all members of the federal government
as would take the time to read it. The name General Joseph Smith was
entering the public lexicon in conversations about the 1844 election
across that nation.

However, a question in early March of 1844 still remained. If Jo was to
be President, he needed a well-known and viable Vice President who could
garner national recognition as a worthy candidate. Somebody who could
add gravitas and weight to the ticket. A stalwart of intellectualism. A
master of propaganda. A friend of the saints but hopefully not somebody
who could be perceived as a crony of Joseph Smith. A name was floated
around the Anointed Quorum of who would be the best fit and finally a
decision was made on 4 March, 1844.

“I suggested the name of James Arlington Bennet, of Long Island, as a
candidate for Vice-President.”

James Arlington Bennet is an interesting guy when it comes to his
association with Mormonism. We first discussed him along with James
Gordon Bennett and John C. Wreck-it Bennett back on episode 132 titled 2
Bennetts for 1. It’s hard to keep all these guys straight, but James
Arlington Bennet was an attorney who served as a second lieutenant in
the First U.S. Artillery division during the War of 1812. He published
the American System of Practical Book-keeping in 1824 which became a
standard in high schools and universities until the 1860s, which is
probably why he gained the attention of the Mormons in 1842 when they
awarded him an honorary doctorate from the University of Nauvoo and
appointed him to the office of Inspector-General of the Nauvoo Legion.
He founded the Arlington Academy in Boston in 1843 and was eventually
baptized into the church by Bloody Brigham Young in August of that year.
James Arlington Bennet was a respectable citizen and veteran of the most
recent international conflict the United States had been through. With
his Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Nauvoo he could run as
VP with the title of Veteran Dr. James Arlington Bennet. He was a good
pick and Jo was smart for floating out his name. Accordingly, White-out
Willard Richards wrote him a letter extending the invitation:

> I have recently mailed to you, Gen. Smith’s views of the Powers and
> Policy of the Government of the U.S., which were drawn forth in
> consequence of his friends selecting him as a candidate for the next

Boy isn’t that last line the truth when it comes to modern Mormonism. To
address the contents of the letter, it was customary at this time for a
leader to be considered noble that they their friends nominate them for
an elected office and the person hums and haws for a bit before
begrudgingly accepting. That’s how every presidential nomination had
happened up to this point and that same cultural song and dance still
makes its way into our culture to some extent today. But make no
mistake, POTUS was something for which Jo had been deliberately
positioning himself for years before this moment; it was just a play.

It is interesting, however, that Bennet was informed of his nomination
to VP in this letter at the same time that they told him they’ll be
announcing it in the next issue of the Times & Seasons. It shouldn’t be
expected that there would be enough time for the letter to get all the
way to New York, for Bennet to reply, and for that reply to make it all
the way back to Nauvoo in a mere week and a half when the next issue of
the Times & Seasons was set to be published.

Regardless, the letter was sent to James Arlington Bennet and the next
issue of the Nauvoo Neighbor was printed with the heading “FOR PRESIDENT
GEN. JOSEPH SMITH, NAUVOO, ILLINOIS VIE PRESIDENT GEN. JAMES A. BENNET,
NEW YORK” at the head in all caps.

But, there was a problem White-out Willard Richards didn’t know when Jo
nominated Arlington Bennet and Richards didn’t know when the letter was
sent.

HoC 6:273

Bummer. Arlington Bennet was born in Ireland and couldn’t be Jo’s VP.
Before Arlington Bennet could receive the letter, make a reply accepting
or rejecting his nomination, and for his letter to get back to the
Nauvoo leadership, a retraction was published in the following edition
of the Nauvoo Neighbor of March 13.

> *Gen. Arlington Bennnet.*—We have learned that Gen. Bennet is
> originally from Ireland, and consequently is ineligible to the office
> of Vice President.

That actually wasn’t true. White-out Willard Richards got some bad intel
and Jo’s power of discernment wasn’t working to know that Bennet was
actually born in New England and totally eligible for VP. But he’d have
to be a prophet or something to know that information so instead Jo just
looked like an idiot. What a crazy turn of events for Arlington Bennet
in the days without email or phones.

Who would replace James Arlington Bennet for the VP spot?

HoC 6:276

> It was agreed that Col. Solomon Capeland, living at Paris, Henry co.,
> Tennesse, should be written to, on the subject of the Vice-Presidency,
> and that Elder W. Woodruff should write the letter, and invite him to

Who is Solomon Copeland? A nobody. He was a guy who was friends with
Woodruff who’d offered his house as a base for missionary stuff in
Tennessee. He was also a resident of Tennessee and the Mormons had to do
something to gain support from southern Democrat voters so this guy from
Tennessee wasn’t a bad bet. Unfortunately the letter was sent but no
reply from Copeland has ever been found. Maybe he denied the nomination,
maybe he agreed to it, maybe he just never got around to answering Jo’s
job offer of the second most powerful job in the world, we just don’t
know.

Regardless of Copeland’s reply, the spot was still up for grabs and the
leadership kept floating out names for weeks after this letter was sent
to Solomon Copeland. The name of Sidney Rigdon as Jo’s running mate
wouldn’t be arrived at for a little while.

A general meeting was held in Nauvoo on Thursday 7 March 1844 which I
find quite interesting. We’re going to spend a bit of time on it, like
we do with most documents. Why are we spending so much time on this
beast? Well it was a meeting that is quite interesting in what it
reveals as a general overview of the past couple years as well as a
forecasting for the plans of Jo and the leadership. It was a talk,
mostly given by Jo, but what it actually reveals is the progress of the
Mormon war machine, Talos, and what the final plans for this war machine
really were. Let’s dig into it and I’ll do my best to just let Jo speak
for himself, only interjecting where necessary.

HoC 6:261

President Joseph Smith then arrived, took the stand, arose, and, after
requesting Orson Pratt to come to the stand and take his post, said:--

Brief pause to talk about that. Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith filed a
complaint against Orsimus F. Bostwick concerning allegations of
polygamy. Bostwick claimed Hyrum was preaching it, Hyrum called him a
liar and filed a complaint charging Bostwick with slander. We talked
about this back on episode 173. Because this was the Nauvoo municipal
court, Hyrum won the case and Bostwick was charged a $50 fine for
slandering Hyrum. It was a mess. When the judgement came down on
February 26<sup>th</sup>:

> Francis M. Higbee, his attorney, (and I would add one of the
> publishers of the Nauvoo expositor 4 months in the future) gave notice
> he should appeal to the municipal court, and then to the circuit

Stirring up the mob wasn’t why Higbee appealed the case, covering up for
polygamy and charging Bostwick a fine in this kangaroo court was why he
appealed the case. Higbee knew the court system in Nauvoo wasn’t just
rigged, but was just a banana republic type legal system created to
insulate the Mormon leadership and he acted with his client’s best
interest in mind by going over the Nauvoo Court’s heads to the county
level. If doing so stirred up mob violence from Carthage, that was Jo’s
fault, not Higbee and Bostwick’s. Clearly this case was grinding on Jo’s
mind for him to talk about it from the pulpit at this special conference
in front of 8,000 Mormons and. He was pulling the strings and the people
sided with their prophet without knowing what was really going on.

> I want the people to speak out, and say whether such men should be
> tolerated and supported in our midst; and I want to know if the

Every member a missionary? This was every citizen a soldier to defend
their prophet with their lives. This creates a dangerous cult mindset
which no rationality can penetrate.

This is very dangerous. Citizen tribunals for anybody perceived as
fighting the will of God and his spokesman prophet. What Jo couldn’t
affect by legal procedures he could accomplish by moving and shaping the
will of the public because he spoke for god. The thousands of Mormons
were putty in his hands. Next he gets even more direct and this is
frankly terrifying as he’s capable of making a single person an enemy
within the ranks deserving of public ostracization and ridicule for
opposing the prophet just because he’s a member of the church.

The court of public opinion just had a star witness, the prophet of god,
indict and incriminate Hiram Kimball and then Jo threw the burden of
proof to Kimball to disprove the allegations. This is a speech that
8,000 Mormons were listening to. You think Hiram Kimball could get a
fair shake now? By the way, “use them up” was a death threat. That
wasn’t veiled. That wasn’t sugar-coated. That was Jo threatening Hiram
Kimball with death because he waived wharfage fees for some of the
Mississippi ferries. Jo was an incredibly dangerous guy.

I have no idea why that’s in there or why it’s relevant but apparently
Jo was feeling insecure this day.

Then Jo gets a little specific with the war he’s waging for the city.

After Hyrum’s remarks a fascinating interaction happens between Jo and
two of his dissenters, soon to be greatest enemies, Charles Foster, and
his brother, Robert D. Bob-the-Builder Foster.

The Fosters knew Joseph Smith and had tangled with him in the Nauvoo
legal system for half a year. They weren’t under his spell like the
other 8,000 people in the crowd. In this instant we see the mechanisms
by which a demagogue can direct the will of the people to serve their
own ends and turn anybody into an enemy of their righteous cause.

After this exchange, Double-Dub Phelps read Jo’s presidential pamphlet
and the Voice of Innocence from Nauvoo from the pulpit which was
supposedly unanimously supported by the crowd. After this, Bloody
Brigham took the stand to ensure complete control and compliance of the
Mormon people when they feel wronged.

Just think of how instilling these sentiments in the minds of the
thousands of Mormons creates a system of abuse of power and absolutely
no transparency or recourse if something bad happens. If somebody hurts
you, betrays you, sues you, leave them alone. If somebody steals your
property, leave them alone. Bloody Brigham wraps with a demonstrable
lie: “I would not sue a man if he owed me five hundred, or a thousand
dollars, should he come to me and say he would not pay me.” Yeah you
wouldn’t sue them, you’d have them thrown in a well by your
sledgehammer, Jedediah Grant or Wild Bill Hickman.

After that John Taylor takes the stand and harps on the Temple after
which Jo takes the stand again and drives home how important tithing is.
Then he gets into a spiel about his political campaign.

On the annexation of Texas, and I read this quote during part 3 of the
Council of Fifty series but this is the real context for it:

> It will be more honorable for us to receive Texas, and set the Negroes
> free, and use the Negroes and Indians against our foes. Don’t let
> Texas go, lest our mothers, and the daughters of the land should laugh

> owners, and send the Negroes to Texas, and from Texas to Mexico, where
> all colors are alike. And if that was not sufficient, I would call
> upon Canada, and annex it.

Jo’s points of annexing Texas, freeing the slaves, and “use the Negroes
and Indians against our foes” even to the point of annexing Canada was
not just spur-of-the-moment pulpit talk from the prophet. These were
plans actually in the works at this time. To drive this home, 2 weeks
before this talk at this early March special conference, secret meetings
were held with the anointed quorum and apostles.

> 23 Feb “Met with the Twelve in the Assembly Room, concerning the
> Oregon and California exploring expedition, Hyrum and Sidney present.
> I told them I wanted an exploration of all that mountain country;
> perhaps it would be best to go direct to Santa Fe. “Send 25 men; let

> raise $500, a good horse and mule, a double barrel gun, one-barrel
> rifle and the other smooth bore, a saddle and bridle, a pair of

> Joseph A Kelting, do.  
> David Fullmer, do.  
> James Emmett, do.  
> Daniel Spencer, do.  
> Samuel Rolfe, do.  
> Daniel Avery, do.  
> Sam\[uel\] W. Richards, do.
> 
> Almon L. Fullmer and Hosea Stout volunteered to go on the western

> 
> 28 Feb 1844 “Thomas S. Edwards volunteered to join the exploring
> expedition to the Rocky Mountains.”

An exploratory and missionary force was now organized to learn strategic
placements for the Mormons to settle and begin the staging armies to
prepare their march on the United States government in the event of Jo
not winning the election. Was Jo serious about his campaign for
President? Absolutely. Did he actually want to win? That’s a harder
question to answer because the plans he and the Twelve were devising at
this time hint at a much larger scheme than simply being elected.

To illustrate this point further, the day after this special meeting,
Jo, with the help of his clerk Double-dub Phelps, wrote this open
letter, of which I take a few small extracts.

HoC 6: 274

A FRIENDLY HINT TO MISSOURI

> One of the most pleasing scenes that can transpire on earth, when a
> sin has been committed by one person against another, *to forgive that

> 
> The voice of reason, the voice of humanity, the voice of the nation,

> throughout the State of Missouri; *wash yourselves, make you clean*,
> lest your negligence should be taken by the world, from the mass of

> 
> Let there be one unison of hearts for justice, and when you reflect
> around your own firesides, remember that fifteen thousand, once among

> that none shall “be deprived of *life, liberty or property*, but by

This was just one in a litany of these open letters sent to Missouri
concerning the tensions resulting from the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838.
Taken altogether, these open letters painted a picture of vengeance and
blood thirst in the Mormon leadership, which was felt in Missouri when
folks would visit St. Louis, the largest city nearest Nauvoo accessible
by ferry. George A. Smith, cousin of Jo, returned the same day this open
letter was written with some intel for the President.

HoC 6:276

> Bro. Geo. A. Smith brought the information that bro. Farnham had just
> returned from St. Louis, and said the people in that place were saying
> “things have come to a strange pass; if Joe Smith is elected
> President, he will raise the devil with Missouri; and if he is not
> elected, he will raise the devil anyhow.”

Yeah… President Joseph Smith was a scary proposition to Missouri who
knew he regarded them as his avowed enemies, but a Joseph Smith who lost
the presidential race and turned to reinforcing and expanding his own
personal militia with freed slaves and indigenous peoples hell-bent on
destroying the American government was far more disturbing. His crusade
would begin with Missouri and nobody held any inaccurate notions of what
that would look like.

This was an exciting time for the prophet and his followers. Two crucial
events happened in Nauvoo Mormon history which we’ve only briefly
introduced up to this point. A mere 2 days after this letter to Missouri
was drafted and read to the highest leadership of the church, the first
meeting of the Council of Fifty was held March 11<sup>th</sup>, kicking
off the establishment of Jo’s theocratic government which was to
actually replace the United States federal government once Mormonism had
amassed enough soldiers to overthrow those powers. We did a three-part
series on the Council of Fifty a few months ago on episodes 168-70 in
the episodes foreshadowing 1844 and now we’ve finally arrived to The
Council of the Kingdom of God actually being established. Many of the
closed-door meetings we’ll be discussing from this time forward were
held with this super-secret Council of Fifty. The second event was the
death of a church leader. On March 9<sup>th</sup> a guy was working on
digging a well somewhere in town. Whether this well was for the temple
or to supply some Nauvoo homes with water, I don’t know. But this guy
was working down in a well and the guys above him were lowering a bucket
filled with rocks for the well down to him. The rope holding the bucket
of rocks snapped and it fell down the well and crushed the man. His name
was King Follet. Both of these events will play into coming episodes of
the show. We’ll be doing a multi-part series on the King Follet
discourse, why it’s important, where the ideas came from, its impact on
Mormon theology at large, all that fun stuff. We’ll continue discussing
Jo’s presidential campaign, dissenters, polygamy and how it was dealt
with, and many other related issues leading up to the Nauvoo Expositor,
and all of this culminating in the shootout at Carthage. What I’m trying
to say, folks, is there’s a light at the end of this very long tunnel
that’s dark and filled with terrors.

Next week begins series on smith-entheogen theory. For those of you
interested in psychedelics in early Mormonism, but you don’t want to
take the time to read through the paper yourself, I’ll be reading
through the most recent paper titled “The entheogenic origins of
Mormonism: a working hypothesis” with my commentary, expansions, and
explanations. This would take 2 episodes if I just read through 41 pages
straight through so I think it’s reasonable to expect the remainder of
December 2019 will be the Smith-entheogen theory top to bottom and we’ll
pick up on the King Follet discourse beginning January of 2020. I hope
the rest of your holiday season is awesome. If you’re looking for Mormon
history beyond this, Braden and I just started a multi-part series on
Mormon money from top to bottom over on Glass Box Podcast. You know the
early history figures; we talk about the more recent history figures and
their importance with Mormon money. It ought to be quite interesting.
