Ep 151 -- Going With the Opposed Votes

On this episode, we air a presentation I gave to a local Post-Mormon
meetup group in St. George, Utah. By common consent they wanted to hear
ALL the material I prepared. The talk begins with a little about my
story, then progresses to points that I find interesting in Mormon
history after studying it for 5 short years. After that, I share the
newest research I've unearthed concerning psychedelics in early
Mormonism. Patrons of the show will want to listen to the Patreon feed
version to get the full unedited talk!
