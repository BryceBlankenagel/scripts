Ep 159 -- Mormon-Native Relations 1830-1840 w/Christopher C. Smith Pt.1

On this episode, we sit down with Mormon historian Chris Smith to
discuss part 1 of a 2-part series on Native and Mormon relations during
Joseph Smith's ministry. We begin with discussing the Book of Mormon
being written explicitly to the Natives and describe Joseph's mindset in
allying with the Natives to overthrow the U.S. Government. Then we
broach the utility of the Council of Fifty and jump into a few important
emissaries Joseph called to forge trading and military relations with
various Native tribes. Lewis Denna (Dana, Denny), and his work with
church leadership, are of particular import as he was a Native convert
to the church. We try to put the plight of the Natives in broader
context throughout America. Then we wrap with the work of Jonathan
Dunham (J. Dunham 'Lamanite') and his work with various Native groups.

Ep 160 -- Mormon-Native Relations 1840-1857 w/Christopher C. Smith Pt.2

On this episode, we get into part 2 of our discussion with Mormon
historian Chris Smith. Part 1 was the primer with a heavy focus on early
Mormon emissaries. Part 2 dives into how these Mormon-Native
relationships were explored and leveraged to hasten the Mormon
theodemocracy with dictatorial prophecies of war and bloodshed. Chris
reads a letter from James Arlington Bennett that minces no words about
the impending Mormon military campaign. Then we bring things back around
to Alpheus Cutler to discuss his Native emissary missions and
settlement. We wrap the conversation with Native-Mormon relations in
Utah under Brigham Young and discuss Walkara. Chris opines on what
lessons we can take from this snapshot of history.
