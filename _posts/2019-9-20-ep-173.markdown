Hey listeners, I know many of you turn the show off after the main
segment is over, but there's something I need to discuss with you in the
C segment so please stick around after the history this week if you
normally tune out. With that out of the way, let's get to the show.

Ep 173 -- Emma's My Hero

On this episode, we check in with Emma and her slipping grasp on power.
She kicks out of the Nauvoo Mansion the Partridge sisters, the Lawrence
sisters, and Jane Manning James to hopefully cut down on the rumors
circulating the city. Orsimus F. Bostwick files a public complaint
against Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith and claims "half a bushel of meal"
will get him any prostitute he wants in Nauvoo. An anonymous poem is
published about Celestial Marriage. W. W. Phelps responds with "The
Voice of Innocence from Nauvoo" and it's read to the first meeting of
the Relief Society of 1844. Emma chastises her counselors telling them
to keep an eye on their daughters.

Emma's vacillation between toleration and revile towards polygamy
complicated the practice and hampered its proliferation. Tensions grew
and fizzled out when she was reminded how powerless she was to stop the
practice.

According to her biographers Linda Newell and Valeen Avery in Mormon
Enigma p. 169:

> Although Emma's open opposition to plural marriage had ceased since
> receiving her second anointing, the presence of some of Joseph's young
> wives under her roof nagged at her. She continued to confront Joseph
> with the issue.

Emma had been dealing with Jo's libertine proclivities for well over a
decade by this point but two tenants of the Nauvoo Mansion exemplified
the most frustrating parts of day-to-day life in polygamy, Emily and
Eliza Partridge. They were 18 and 20, young and vivacious; Emma was
nearly 40 years old with 4 kids and frequent bouts of illness that
rendered her bedridden and unable to attend to the socially expected
duties of the massive new Nauvoo Mansion with its many guests. The
extent to which Emma was aware of how prolific polygamy was at this time
will remain a historical mystery forever, but some of her interactions
reveal she had some kind of idea of how deep the practice ran. Her
melancholy and disengagement from the Relief Society through 1843 and
into early 44 may point to some apprehensions about how much it had
become a rumor mill. Maybe she had grown detached from her closest
friends in the Relief Society leadership, all of whom had been sealed to
Joseph by early 1844.

Emma's time was increasingly occupied with business matters in Nauvoo.
Joseph was a terrible businessman and Bloody Brigham had only really
stepped up to the plate to offer his adept accounting and business
skills to help with immigration of European converts. Jo's time was
completely monopolized with political and public relations matters and
giving the occasional sermon to keep the church at large in check. Emma
was left with administrating the Red Brick Store, the Nauvoo Mansion,
land acquisition and sales on behalf of the church, and sharing letter
exchanges with prominent and wealthy members and gentiles.

With so much on her plate, overwhelming stress spread her quite thin and
led to internment in the home for repeated bouts of mysterious
illnesses. There were also likely a lot of nasty infections going around
Nauvoo with polygamy becoming more widespread so any time Emma did gain
Jo's undivided attention and affection, she ran a legitimate risk of
catching infections from her walking cesspool of a husband. Emma was
bound to deal with the mess Jo made of the church and family finances.
She was capable, but finances were far from her specialty. This would
have put her under even more stress.

Where she did have some control over her life was in the Nauvoo Mansion,
which included half a dozen of Jo's younger wives as tenants. On
particularly stressful days or when some interaction between Jo and his
teenage wives would set her off, Emma would attempt to exert some
semblance of her waning power.

Mormon Enigma:

> Emily Partridge was the only plural wife who recounted the events. She
> said that interviews with Joseph, her sister, herself, and Emma
> occurred frequently. "She sent for us one day to come to her room.
> Joseph was present looking like a martyr. (those baby blue puppy eyes,
> how can you be mad at god's chosen messenger?) Emma said some very
> hard things. Joseph should give us up or blood would flow. She would
> rather her blood would run pure than be poluted in this manner." Emily
> did not say precisely that Emma threatened suicide, but perhaps
> Joseph's fear that Emma had reached the point of taking such a drastic
> step prompted this final confrontation. Emily "felt indignant towards
> Joseph for submitting to Emma... His countenance was the perfect
> picture of despair." Emily wrote, "\[Emma\] insisted that we should
> promise to break our \[marriage\] covenants that we had made before
> God. Joseph asked her if we made her the promise she required, if she
> would cease to trouble us, and not persist in our marrying someone
> else. She mad e the promise. Joseph came to us and shook hands with us
> and the understanding was that all was ended between us. I for one
> meant to keep this promise I was forced to make."

Emily and Eliza Partridge were the perfect microcosm of the troubles of
patriarchal polygyny and Emma juxtaposed to these young women made her
feel somehow less than. In her own home, with her husband of 17 years,
Emma had to compete with Emily and Eliza for her own husband's attention
all while trying to keep rumors and accusations at bay. She wanted Emily
and Eliza to get married to somebody to keep up appearances and stop
people from whispering about those Partridge girls living in the
prophet's home. Less than a year prior to this interaction where Emma
forced Eliza and Emily to break their marriage with Jo, Emma had taken
Emily and Eliza's hands and literally given them to Jo in the greatest
show of acquiescence and pacification to Jo's incessant pleading for
more wives. Now, in January 1844, Emma had flipped again on tolerating
the Partridge sisters and wanted the whole thing ended. Emily saying she
intended to keep the promise she made to Emma that the marriage was
over, leads one to believe that it was ended to keep up appearances to
Emma, but that Jo and Emily maintained their relationship in secret away
from Emma.

The interaction between Jo and Emily after this fight is quite
revealing, all remembered by Emily long after the events.

> "How do you feel, Emily?"
>
> "I feel as anybody would under the circumstances."
>
> "You know my hands are tied," Joseph responded.
>
> Emily said he looked as if he would "sink into the earth"; her "heart
> was melted" and her anger left. But before she had time to speak
> Joseph was gone. Emma entered as he went out.
>
> "Emily, what did Joseph say to you?" she asked.
>
> "He asked me how I felt."
>
> "You might as well tell me," Emma said. "I am determined that a stop
> shall be put to these things and I want you to tell me what he says to
> you."
>
> "I shall not tell you," ... "He can say what he pleases to me, and I
> shall not report it to you, there has been mischief enough made by
> doing that. I am sick of these things as you can be."

Emily remembers her reaction to this line as "\[Emma\] gloried in my
spunk." But, we don't know how Emma actually felt when Emily's teenage
insubordination to her superior sister-wife was so boldly stated right
to her face. I would postulate that Emma was probably furious. Emily
refused to obey Emma's wishes which just exemplified Emma's slipping
power over her life and the lives of those who looked up to her.

Emily later remembered of this time, from Mormon Enigma:

> The situation became intolerable for both Emma and the two sisters.
> Emily stated, "Emma could not rest till she had got us out of the
> house and then she was not satisfied, but wanted us to leave the city.
> She offered to give us money to pay our expenses if we would go. We
> consulted Joseph, he said we might make a visit to some of our
> relatives, who were living up the river two or three hundred miles. So
> we agreed to go, and she gave us ten dollars. Joseph said it was
> insufficient and for us not to go so we gave it up and returned the
> money to Emma."

The rumors about Jo and the Partridge sisters were so oppressive that
Emma knew even if the marriages were called off, the rumors wouldn't
stop until the sisters were no longer in the house. She resolved to send
the Partridge sisters out of town to assuage the rumors. She could deal
with the Lawrence sisters and Jane Manning James after she dealt with
the bad optics of the Partridge sisters. The Lawrence sisters were
explainable. They were orphans and Jo and Emma were their wards. Them
living in the Nauvoo Mansion wasn't as suspect as the Partridge sisters
because they had no real reason to be living there. The Partridge
sisters were proper marrying age, both single, their parents were close
friends of Jo and Emma before Edward had died back in 1840. Jo and Emma
had watched them grow up from when they first met Emily and Eliza in
1831 when they were like 5 and 8 years old respectively. But, just like
Helen Mar Kimball, they weren't allowed to court young men their age
because they were betrothed to the prophet. This raised suspicion.

By late January 1844, Emma prevailed. The Partridge sisters were moved
into the home of "a respectable family". The Sarah and Maria Lawrence
were also moved to another home as well and Jane Manning James moved out
of the home saying "they broke up the Mansion" due to these
disagreements over polygamy.

This breaking up of the Nauvoo Mansion in January and February of 1844
marks Emma's more hardline stance against polygamy from which she would
never return for the rest of Jo's life. Writing in lockstep with the
vilification of Emma in the Utah Territory, John Taylor, not yet
prophet, wrote about Emma.

> Emma Smith, at first professed having faith in the revelation on
> celestial marriage, but afterwards forsook it, using her influence to
> pervert the minds of the sisters and set them against it. She tried it
> with my wife... \[Leonora\] told me many things Emma Smith had told
> her. When I met Joseph I said, 'Brother Joseph, do you know that
> sister Emma has been talking thus and so to my wife, and telling her
> such and such things, and said that you have denied the revelation
> yourself?'

Jo apparently replied:

> "Brother Taylor, Sister Emma would dethrone Jehovah himself, if she
> could, for the accomplishment of her purposes."

Consider when this was written and who it came from. This was written by
John Taylor in 1876, a mere 3 years before Emma died in Nauvoo and her
power in the RLDS was at its height. This was one year before Bloody
Brigham suffered his long-overdue death and the smear campaign against
Emma was complete and absolute. She was the enemy of everything the
Great Basin church stood for and John Taylor was in line to be prophet.
It was the cultural norm to paint Emma in the most horrible and
malignant light. I'd be willing to bet those words never came out of
Jo's mouth because it's rhetoric so similar to other reminiscences about
Emma by other Utah Mormons around this same time, especially by Jo's
surviving wives. But, did Emma try to persuade Leonora Taylor to oppose
the practice? Yeah, maybe, who knows, Emma was the bogeywoman in Utah so
maybe she did, maybe she didn't, it doesn't really matter at the end of
the day because the Utah Mormons believed she did.

There are, however, contemporary sources that reveal she was in a tough
place with celestial marriage. The later reminiscences from Utah Mormons
are propaganda, but contemporary sources paint a picture not dissimilar,
but more sympathetic and deeper towards Emma. A visitor from anti-Mormon
haven of Carthage talked about her sister visiting Nauvoo.

> \[My sister\] went into the hotel parlor... to await the call to
> breakfast. Ten or twelve young women were assembled here, laughing and
> talking. Mrs. Emma Smith presently joined them, and recognizing my
> sister, whom she had met before, entered into conversation with her.
> Upon my sister asking, "Mrs. Smith, where does your church get this
> doctrine of spiritual wives?" her face flushed scarlet, and her eyes
> blazed as she replied, "Straight from hell, madam." Some of the young
> women blushed too, others giggled, and still others were stolid and
> indifferent.

Yeah, because of course that was an inappropriate question that made
everybody uncomfortable. But, of course, that account was published in
1916 when Eudocia Marsh was probably in her 80s remembering something
her sister told her about from 65 years ago and Mormon polygamy was
still a common topic of conversation throughout America. If this
interaction actually occurred anything like it was reported, it was most
likely in late 1843 or early 44 before most of the younger women were
removed from the Nauvoo Mansion at Emma's request.

What the passage does reveal is the inner conflict with Emma, the
trouble within the Nauvoo Mansion with her sister-wives, polygamy's
counter-Victorian tabooism, and how hard it was to keep secrets
regardless of how good of Masons the women of the Relief Society were.

Linda Newell and Val Avery's excellent book, Mormon Enigma, juxtaposes
these antagonistic reports of Emma with other versions which are far
more sympathetic, many from women who were similarly caught up,
unwillingly, in the cogs of Utah polygamy.

Jo had so deeply given to his reptilian nature of rampant procreation
that he would never attempt to scale back the doctrine and practice of
polygamy. He wouldn't budge on the question of whether or not polygamy
was a Mormon tenet, but he would budge on how much he exposed Emma to
it. However, she was playing her own cards right in getting his younger
wives to move out. When everybody lived in the Nauvoo Mansion, Jo could
be absent from Emma's presence for 10 minutes and another teenage rape
would happen in the house unbeknownst to Emma. He could spend any amount
of time in the rooms of any of his wives and Emma had very little
control over the situation. Emma even made frequent trips to St. Louis
for supplies for the Red Brick Store and other businesses she controlled
as Jo's safety net. During these week-long trips, who knows what went on
in the Mansion in her absence.

However, this changed when Jane Manning James, the Lawrence sisters, and
the Partridge sisters were moved to other homes. Emma remained as Jo's
only wife in the house after that period. Now, she could keep closer
tabs on him. I don't want to make it sound like she was policing him,
but that's kind of what this was. She didn't want him to be sleeping
with his dozens of wives, he wanted to sleep with his dozens of wives.
Those two concepts kind of don't work together. But, Jo living with only
Emma in the Nauvoo Mansion was a lot better for public optics. It was a
lot harder to silence sex-ring rumors when half a dozen underage girls
are living in the Mansion with Jo and Emma. But Pandora had so
thoroughly escaped the box by this point in early 1844 that Jo and Emma
living alone in the Mansion was merely a brief sanctuary away from the
troubles caused by polygamy in the outside world.

Two of these troubles came in the form of an anonymous poem and a guy
named Orsimus F. Bostwick. First, the anonymous poem, often attributed
to William Law, but its authorship remains uncertain. This poem was
published in the Warsaw Message, the paper that came after the death of
the Warsaw Signal and the Warsaw Signal was birthed from after Thomas C.
Sharp took back over editing duties.

**BUCKEYE\'\'S LAMENTATION FOR WANT OF MORE WIVES.**

I once thought I had knowledge great,\
  But now I find \'\'tis small;\
I once thought I\'\'d Religion, too,\
  But I find I\'\'ve none at all.\
For I have got but *one lone wife,* \
  And can obtain no more;\
And the doctrine is, I can\'\'t be saved,\
  Unless I\'\'ve *half a score!*

The *narrow gate* that Peter kept,\
  In ages long ago,\
Is locked and barred since he gave up\
  The keys to *beardless* JOE.\
And Joe proclaims it is too small,\
  And causes great delay,\
And that he has permission got\
  To open the *broad way.*

The narrow gate did well enough\
  When Peter, James,and John,\
Did lead the saints on Zion-ward,\
  In *single file* along:\
When *bachelors*, like good old *Paul*,\
  Could win the glorious prize,\
And *maids*, without a *marriage rite,* \
  Reach \"mansions in the skies.\"

But we have other teaching now,\
  Of greater glories far;\
How a *single glory\'\'s* nothing more\
  Than some lone twinkling star.\
A *two-fold* glory\'\'s like the moon,\
  That shines so sweet at night,\
Reflecting from her gracious lord\
  Whatever he thinks right.

A *tenfold* glory-that\'\'s the prize!\
  Without it you\'\'re undone!\
But with it you will shine as bright\
  As the bright shining sun.\
There you may reign\'\'\"like mighty Gods,\
  Creating worlds so fair;-\
At least a *world* for every *wife* \
  That you take with you there.

The man that has got ten fair wives, \
  *Ten* worlds he may create;\
And he that has got less than this,\
  Will find a bitter fate.\
The one or two that he may have,\
  He\'\'d be deprived of then;\
And they\'\'ll be given as *talents* were\
  To him who has got ten.

And \'\'tis so here, in this sad life-\
  Such ills you must endure-\
Some *priest* or *king*, may claim your wife\
  Because that you are poor.\
A *revelation* he may get-\
  Refuse it if you dare!\
And you\'\'ll be damned *perpetually* \
  By our good *Lord* the *Mayor!*

But if that you yield willingly,\
  Your daughters and your wives,\
In *spiritual marriage* to our POPE,\
  He\'\'ll bless you all your Lives;\
He\'\'ll *seal you up,* \
  be darned you can\'\'t,\
No matter what you do-\
  If that you only *stick* to him,\
He swears HE\'\'LL *take* you *through.*

He\'\'ll lead you on to the broad gate,\
  Which he has opened wide-\
In *solid column* you shall march,\
  And enter side by side.\
And no delay you\'\'ll meet with there,\
  But *\"forward march\"* you shall:-\
For he\'\'s not only our *Lord* MAYOR\
  But *Lord* LEUTENANT-RAL.

This is the secret doctrine taught\
  By Joeand the *red rams-*\
Although inpublic they deny-\
  But then \'\'tis all a sham.\
They fear the indignation just,\
  Of those who have come here,\
With hands thats clean and honest hearts, \
  To serve the Lord infear.

Thus, all the *twelve* do slyly teach,\
  And slyly practice, too;\
And even the *sage Patriarch,*\
  Wont have *untied his shoe:*\
For sure, \'\'twould be quite impolite,\
  If not a great disgrace,\
To have a *widow* sister fair\
*  Spit* in a Prophet\'\'s face!

But Joe at snaring beats them all,\
  And at the rest does laugh;\
For *widows* poor, and *orphan girls,*\
  He can ensnare with *chaff,*\
He sets his snares around for all,-\
  And very seldom fails\
To catch some thoughtless *Partridges,* \
*  Snow*-birds or *Knight*-ingales!

But there are hundred other birds\
  He never can make sing;\
Who wont be driven nor *draged t*o hell,\
  By *prophet, priest* nor *king:*\
Whose sires have bled in days gone by,\
  For their dear country\'\'s cause;\
And who will still maintain its rights,\
  Its *Liberty* and *Laws!*

This was Buckeye's Lamentation, published in the 7 February 1844 edition
of the Warsaw Message. The next major 1844 expose came from Orsimus
Bostwick, who made scathing accusations about Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith
and prostitution. Bostwick claimed that "he could take a half bushel of
meal and get what accommodation he wanted with almost any woman in the
city."

To respond to these newest fires set around Nauvoo, Jo put William Wines
Double-dub Phelps to work to write "A Voice of Innocence from Nauvoo."
This was a propaganda pamphlet that was presented to the Relief Society,
which Emma called to order on March 9, the first such meeting in 1844.
The entire pamphlet was read to the gathering of over 1,000 sisters.
This is so painfully cringy, but we're going to read it top to bottom
and discuss it as we go because this was an important pamphlet in Nauvoo
polygamy history.

After the pamphlet was read to all in attendance, a vote was called. The
vote, according to the Relief Society Minutes, kept by Eliza R. Snow, my
personal historical crush, was called by Jo asked "who would be willing
to receeve the principles of vurtue, keep the commandments of God, and
uphold the Presidentess in putting \<down\> iniquity. After that, Emma
stood up and "said \[it was\] her determination... to do her Duty
Effectully---in puting down transgresion."

Then Emma's first counselor, Elizabeth Ann Whitney, called a vote and
"requested the Sisters to Pray that Sister Emma might be supported, to
teach us the principles of Righteousness expressed her fears, that
Jugement would bgin at the house of God". After which, Emma stood again
to respond to the support of the Relief Society and "said it was high
time for Mothers to wach over their Daughters & exhort them to keep the
path of virtue"

Mothers, watch over your daughters. That's an important line. Emma was
aware of polygamy. Undoubtedly, she knew that her secretary, Eliza R.
Snow, was her sister wife but that line was a laser-sighted tactical
strike at her counselors because their teenage daughters were also her
sister-wives.

Emma had a lot of jobs she probably never wanted. Her primary job was to
pick up the pieces from the constant messes her husband made. One of
those jobs was to keep a lid on the rumors, and it was a tough and
unenviable job. That was one of the main purposes of the Relief Society
and its very first actionable items the society tackled when it was
originally formed 2 years almost to the day prior to this meeting. The
Relief Society was capable of keeping women in line, as much as it was
used to groom younger women to accept the doctrine of celestial
marriage, but it was also a factory of rumors, which couldn't be
controlled with how many people were members.

The Relief Society meeting where this was read marked the penultimate
meeting of the group. The final meeting under Emma's administration is a
subject of a future episode. The decline in Relief Society engagement,
Emma's marked absence during the meetings of 1843, her further
ostracization from the inner-most group of Mormon elites; all of these
factors point to a deliberate and calculated isolation of the Elect Lady
because she wasn't on board with the new and everlasting covenant.

Emma's grasp on power in her own home was a pattern which carried into
her loss of control of the Relief Society. It met throughout 1843 many
times without her as her time became increasingly occupied with other
affairs and keeping peace in the home with half a dozen teenage
sister-wives and her own health deteriorating. She was slowly becoming
an island because she didn't go full-tilt into believing polygamy was
totally from god because Jo says it is. Jo simply didn't have the same
level of control over Emma that he did over more than ten thousand
citizens of Nauvoo. In many ways, Emma was Jo's greatest weakness and he
hers. Emma had an ability to ground her husband the way nobody else
could. Jo had a way of pushing Emma beyond all her limits and proving to
herself and anybody around her that she was tenacious and capable of
withstanding the hurricane of controversy brought on by her husband.

What Emma could have achieved with her intelligence and ability to punch
up against socially superior opponents is a subject of hypothetical
thought-exercises. She was smart and capable, but in Victorian America,
a smart and capable woman had roughly the same limited options of any
other woman. Emma was able to accomplish so much because she wasn't on
equal footing with her fellow women of the time. By virtue of being the
first lady of Mormonism, Emma was elevated to a post of authority that
allowed her intelligence and abilities in secular and religious
leadership positions to flourish. Her true opinions and inner thoughts
about her situation and her husband are a subject of mystery. If it's
any indicator of her opinions, her husband and one of her best friends
would be dead in 3 months' time from this penultimate Relief Society
meeting and she would remarry on Joseph's birthday to a guy who never
believed in Mormonism. I believe that was absolutely deliberate because
she could have picked any of the other 364 less-significant days of the
year to marry Lewis Bidamon, but she chose Jo's birthday instead. We can
put labels on Emma all day when we see so many different accounts about
who she was or how she conducted herself, and most of those are true to
some degree. But any summary of her will always be lacking. One thing is
for certain, she was a survivor in every sense of the word. She was a
survivor of an oppressive system contrived by her own husband and she
absolutely made the best of the situation that was constantly running
wildly out of her control. She thrived in adversity. She overcame
overwhelming odds and waged battle in public fora with men far above her
in social standing. She made a place for herself and occupied it with
fierce tenacity. She was ruthless in defending her property, business
interests, and family in the wake of the schism crisis. Whatever all
these old-school church leaders want to call her, I'll call Emma what
resonates with me most, considering everything I know about her. Emma
Hale Smith Bidamon is my hero.

5 years ago, after looking for months and finding nothing, I decided
that there needed to be a resource of pure Mormon history in an
accessible medium. Not historical journal articles or books that are
longer than the Book of Mormon and harder to read, and certainly not a
manifesto of anti-Mormon punchlines, I read those so you don't have to.
I'm talking about something that people who know nothing about Mormonism
or its history can pick up, consume, and walk away educated. Naked
Mormonism was born. I quickly learned, the trick to podcasting is
consistency and over 5 years I've released only one episode late, and
have taken only 1 sick week from the show because it's hard to research,
script, and record with the flu. Since it began, this research endeavor
has significantly grown. When the show began, I was, tortoise-like,
churning out an episode every 2 weeks. Then, you, the listeners, decided
to hire me full-time and I went to weekly. I jumped on to cohost
MyBookofMormon podcast to read the D&C with historical context, because
it's so boring without context, and I started and subsequently rebooted
the Glass Box Podcast to take on Mormon-related headlines and keep Naked
Mormonism pure history.

Through listener support, here at Ground Gnomes studios we churn out 18
shows a month with consistent quality standards. People have told me
that I should put everything behind a paywall, but why? I'd much rather
put everything out there for everybody to consume and drive my run-down
27-year-old car because I'm one of those lucky few people who gets to
make a living through my passion. Podcasting for a living because of you
amazing listeners affords me so many great opportunities to learn and
teach about Mormonism and provides hours per week for related
side-projects. Patrons, be sure to stick around after the credits today
to hear about recently completed projects, projects in the works, and
future projects I dream about at night. My point is, this labor of love
fulfills me more than any 9-5 ever could. The gift of total freedom you
listeners give me every week is priceless and it makes my life better
than I can put into words to describe.

I feel like I've built up enough of a relationship with you to be
vulnerable and honest for a minute. I received a couple of unpleasant
letters in the mail. These letters came the week before starting this
3-week nearly 7,000-mile road trip to New York for JWHA, SLC for the
Protect Every Child march (are you going to be there Oct 5^th^? Will I
see you in the crowd? Information is in the show notes), and LA for the
Opening Arguments live show. The details of these letters I received
aren't important to you, dear listener, but suffice it to say, I'm
looking for solutions as every small business owner must. I can take out
an old IRA from my truck-driving days, but that's always a stupid
decision in the long run. Or, I can make a vulnerable and honest
petition to all of you and essentially ask for a pay-raise.

Here's my sales pitch. What are you getting when you financially support
this podcast? First off, you're getting a bunch of extra paid content.
If you enjoy this show, sign up for a buck a show and you get more
Mormon history. That's the extended editions of every episode which
includes cursings and loud laughter that I've removed from this show to
make it safe for work and sensitive TBM ears. You also get the NaMo book
club where we read old Mormon history books with my commentary. We just
finished John Bennett's 1842 expose and Pratt's 1839 History of the Late
Persecution and we're just starting Mormonism Unvailed, the first and
most influential anti-Mormon book that's just a bucket of laughs. When
you join the NaMo family you also get invites for the NaMo Home
Evenings, our live hangouts with special guests where you can ask
questions or just come hang out with us. We also do episodes about how
to talk to missionaries and the best ways to navigate those
conversations. It's a ton of extra content available to you at your
leisure. These audio entertainment products you purchase are what you
get out of the transaction.

But, let's talk for a minute about what that money really does on the
back end here at Ground Gnomes Studios. What you're really doing with
that money is generating a body of research by funding my education.
Look, I could go to school for a history degree. If it were reasonable
to shut down the podcast, live in Seattle making minimum wage from a
part-time job, and get a history degree, it would allow me to eventually
get a job working in the archive department of a historical society and
pay off those student loans in 30-years' time. That's a safe and
reasonable path. However, I hope by this point in time I've amply
illustrated to all of you that the path I'm blazing, and all of you are
giving me the tools and faculties TO blaze, isn't safe and reasonable,
but it's my passion and I'm hell-bent determined to make a career from
independent Mormon history research.

At the end of the day, I write historical essays for a living and my
forthcoming, and long-ago promised, book on psychedelics in early
Mormonism is my dissertation. The way I do this podcast isn't smart in a
business sense, but it's ethical and it's the way I want to run it. What
do I mean by that? Allow me another minute to explain.

I've done ads in the past but they only generate a pittance in exchange
for an immense amount of annoyance to the listeners, and myself, and
I've recently turned down any new ad prospects for those reasons. I'd
much rather spend that ad time thanking those of you by name who support
the show directly which is why we do patron shoutouts every episode;
that's the adspace on Naked Mormonism.

Every dollar of that money is funneled back into the show to make more
of a better product for those willing to purchase it. It's funded a live
benefit show on the demise of Joseph Smith and over a dozen public
presentations and live shows about Mormon history. But that money also
has a tangible impact on the field of Mormon history. By the end of next
week's episode, I'll have given just a hair under \$2,700 in speaking
fees to guests of the podcast who work in academia. I don't know of any
other podcasts that pay speaking fees and it's a dumb business model for
the current podcast market, but I believe it's an ethical business model
and I'm determined to make it work. Every Mormon historian is hungry,
yours truly included, and the field is pretty lean unless you work for
the church; and the corporate church with its billions in assets and
holdings, and its entire departments of history researchers, is our
current greatest competitor in the marketplace of Mormon history.
Needless to say, it's not a fair fight. Independent Mormon history is a
lot of work that will never make anybody, who doesn't work for the
church, rich.

So, that's the state of affairs and a window into the cogs of the
machine of Ground Gnomes Studios. What can you, as the listener, do
about it? First off, you can give me a small portion of your hard-earned
money through patreon.com/nakedmormonism. A dollar an episode unlocks
all the extra content I mentioned earlier in that patron-exclusive feed
and funds better and more content creation. If you're in a financial
position that you simply won't feel that 4 dollars a month, that's just
one cup of coffee, hopefully I've made the case that the product you
get, and, more importantly, the body of research you're funding, is a
great investment. Hopefully a buck a show is negligible to you, but
means the world to me.

Just like our new patrons this week: making for +- \$X

We also had an incredibly generous one-time donation from Jay Mumford,
one of the earliest listeners of the show. Thank you for everything,
Jay, especially your proNOUNciation corrections.

I've always read new patrons but the actual numbers fluctuate so I'm
going to start reading how much of a change it is from the previous
week's show just so I'm a bit more transparent about finances on the
show, in case seeing that actual dollar amount on the patreon page isn't
enough transparency. We'll try it for a few weeks anyway.

What if you don't want to go through the hassle of making an account and
signing up on patreon to support this show and all the content creators
you love? Well, a one-time donation is great and that can be given
through paypal to <BryceBlankenagel@gmail.com>, but once again,
patreon.com/nakedmormonism is truly the best method.

So, what if you love the show and you want to help, but you're a
starving student or on a fixed income and you're already running
negative every month so 4 dollars just exacerbates the problem? Well you
can still contribute by reviewing the show. iTunes rankings are huge
when people search for podcasts and most podcatchers utilize the itunes
search engine when people are looking for a new show. Reviews are the
single-most important metric iTunes search engine uses when showing
results. Good reviews mean the iTunes algorithm gods shine their loving
face on your show and exhibit it to the podcast-listening world. Bad
reviews invoke their wrath and the show quickly dies in obscurity, never
to surface to the recommended lists ever again. Your financial support
goes a long way. iTunes reviews live on forever and they literally take
the sum total of 9 seconds to log in, search for Naked Mormonism, click
the little 5-star icon, and close the app. It's that easy and it helps
more than you can imagine. Stitcher, or any other podcast app, those are
usually more technical for reviews and the reviews don't count for as
much, but a high review there is super helpful as well.

What if you're somebody who can't support the show financially, and you
don't want to take the 9 seconds from your day to review the show? Well
you can still help. Tag me or Naked Mormonism in twitter, facebook, or
reddit threads about Mormon history and you'll draw me from my lair to
comment and often provide links to resources or podcast episodes I've
done on topics. Organic, word-of-mouth growth is the most effective way
to spread the word.

What if you're a listener who can't support the show financially,
doesn't want to take the time to leave a review, and you're taking the
advice of the prophet or Eli Bosnick and you're doing a social media
fast? You listen to this podcast, so I bet you listen to other podcasts.
Send a message to hosts of other podcasts and tell them you think I'd be
an awesome guest to have on their show. I put a significant amount of
prep work in whenever I'm invited onto a podcast and I've only ever
turned down one request because he has an alt-right platform and the
conversation had little chance of going anywhere. I'm willing and
equipped to talk just about anything Mormon-related on any podcast in
any amount of depth and thoroughness. If you want a collab between me
and some of your other favorite podcasts, let them know and put us in
touch and we'll take it from there.

I don't like doing these hard-sell pitches. I was really good at selling
batteries in my old job. Those sales skills didn't exactly translate to
this market because I'm no longer selling somebody else's product, I'm
selling my own intellectual property that I put out there for free to
begin with. So... that's... uh... yeah... the business model of
podcasting is a strange one. Today's sales pitch isn't to guilt you into
giving me money. If that's what you're looking for, join the church,
they'll be happy to guilt you into giving up 10% of your income. This
has simply been my way, as a skeptic, of reasoning with you to persuade
you to believe that it's a good idea to invest a fraction of a percent
of your income to a massive research and content-creation endeavor at a
time when that support is desperately needed due to unforeseen
circumstances. I dream of the day when the Ground Gnomes media empire
can employ more than three people and produces dozens of hours of
content from multiple content creators every week, youtube shows,
podcasts, blog posts, all backed up by a team of independent historians.
Until Ground Gnomes Studios grows to that level, we're making due with
what we have and we're staying hungry to keep our senses heightened and
alert. If you can't give your money through patreon.com/nakedmormonism,
I respectfully ask that you give a little of your effort to help spread
the word. If you can't give either of those, you still gave me the most
precious resource you have, your time. You still hit the download button
and listened to the end of this belabored, but much-needed sales-pitch,
and I want to thank you for that. I'll be out of the studio for the next
three weeks for New York, SLC, and LA, but I lined up some great shows
for y'all in the meantime and we'll thank new patrons once I get back to
the studio.

Thank you for sticking around and thank you so much for lending me your
ear.
