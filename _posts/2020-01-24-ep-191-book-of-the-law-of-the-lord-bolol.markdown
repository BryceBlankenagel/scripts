Ep 191 – Book of the Law of the Lord (BoLoL)

On this episode, money issues in Nauvoo become the springboard for a
discussion of the Book of the Law of the Lord. What is contained in the
enigmatic pages of this unique artifact? What was the purpose of
creating it? What happened with the controversy surrounding it? Find out
the answers to these questions and more about a rare Mormon artifact you
didn’t know you needed to know about\! Yes, I know that was
clickbaitish, but it’s a really cool book more people should talk
about\! Also, Apostle Boyd K. Packer didn’t want the world to see it so
you know it has to be good\!

Joseph Smith’s plans for the Mormons and America at large were quite
grand. He had a lot in store for the world if he could but carry his
plans to fruition and show the world that a better version of itself
awaited should it trust him as its supreme temporal leader and Elohiem
as its supreme spiritual leader.

How do you build a kingdom? You basically have to buy it if you’re
averse to bloodshed, which Jo was. For this reason, money was always in
a shortage. This is one of those bedrock issues we talk about relatively
frequently on the show like polygamy, power struggles, dissent among
trusted elites, and a few other fundamental issues which seem to
influence nearly everything that happens in Nauvoo Mormonism.

Desperation fueled these desperate money ploys. The primary income for
building the Nauvoo empire was tithing donations, but those can be quite
unreliable especially as more Mormons giving more money to the church
resulted in an overall more destitute population. Beyond that, those who
had more tended to give more. Those folks became frequent targets of the
leadership to extort as much possible from them. But, you’re a rich guy
and the prophet or apostles come knocking a couple times a month asking
for money, it gets old pretty quickly and the promises become more grand
and less fulfilled.

At the end of the day, Nauvoo in 1844 was a big city, but had little
town charm. It had grown from a small, homogenous group of people into a
relatively large metropolis but it still retained many of the trappings
of a small town. Everybody talked to everybody about everybody else’s
business. People saw their neighbors every day and that small-town drama
pervaded the culture, especially because those in authority in Nauvoo
were also the same figures in ecclesiastical authority. In normal small
towns, you have the pastor to gossip about, and then the city council
and mayor with their own set of gossip. In Nauvoo, however, those were
the same people who were subjects of town gossip. People were constantly
nosing into other’s business as a form of entertainment before radio and
television became centers of attention.

The thing with a small town is it’s also really challenging to hide
one’s business. If a farmer has a herd of cattle on the outskirts of
town goes on a cattle drive to sell off a portion of the herd, everybody
in town saw that the herd was decimated after his return, and everybody
knew this guy was walking around with some money in his pocket. A
wandering trader might come into town with some rare or desirable items,
stay for a few days, then leave town without carrying those items and it
wasn’t long before all the Nauvoo townsfolk knew that somebody in town
had just traded a sum of money for that desirable thing. Maybe they kept
it in a trunk at the foot of their bed, maybe they carried it on their
person. Is the item in a place which isn’t well-guarded? How did they
get the money to buy it in the first place? Do they have more money
laying around unguarded somewhere in their house?

Not only did this gossip pervade everyday interactions of many citizens
of Nauvoo, but Jo had his little birdies in every dark alley of the city
funneling information back to him. Nothing escaped his notice.
Perception was a skill he’d curried in his early days of New York
treasure-digging and occult practices and it served him well in building
his religious empire. When somebody in Nauvoo had some money, he knew
about it and the gear cogs of the cycle of religious extortion would
lurch into motion.

I offer as an example of this a Mr. Orme. Orme was a Mormon and
apparently pretty wealthy. It seems he’d answered the door to the
apostles asking for money quite a few times and he was sick of
unfulfilled promises. Instead of going himself, Jo sent a couple of
trusted thugs to Orme’s house to get some of that piggy bank he’d been
hiding away for some time.

> Being in a strait to raise money to assist the hands in the Pine
> country, I sent Elders B\[righam\]. Young and W\[illard\]. Richards to
> borrow some money from Mr. Orme, who, it is believed, had a large sum
> of money lying idle, but did not get any.

The Mormon leadership was always “in a strait to raise money” whether
that was for a specific project like Lyman Wight’s Pinery Mission or for
general operating costs of the church and its functionaries. The
apostles simply didn’t carry as much clout as the prophet himself did.
Mr. Orme’s refusal to give up any of his money can be readily juxtaposed
with Jo personally approaching a Mr. John Wilkie the previous day. Jo
went to Wilkie’s house and asked for some of the money he’d been
hoarding.

Vogel HoC 6:293

> \[W\]ent to see brother John Wilkie; he had sent to me to come and see
> him; he wanted to know what he should do. I told him of the order of
> tithing, \&c., and he wanted I should come again.

The next day, Jo did just that and had the exchange recorded in the Book
of the Law of the Lord. We’ll discuss what that is in a minute but this
is how it was recorded:

> This day President Joseph Smith rode over to brother John Wilkie’s, at
> his special request, to give him some instructions relative to his
> duty in regard to tithing and consecration.
> 
> Brother Wilkie has for a long time back been struggling with his

> causes. His faithful companion has persevered diligently, and with

> 
> Brother Wilkie now feels anxious to do right in all things, and
> especially to pay his tithing to the full. President Joseph showed him

> 
> He also signified his intention of paying more as soon as he could get

> upon him and his companion, that they should have the blessing of God
> to attend them in their basket and in their store; that they should
> have the blessing of health and salvation and long life, inasmuch as
> they would continue to walk in obedience to the commandments of God.
> 
> May the Lord grant his Spirit and peace to abide upon brother Wilkie
> and his companion through the remainder of their days; may their
> hearts expand and become enlarged to receive the fullness of the
> blessings of the kingdom of heaven; may they have the light of eternal

> may they be shielded from the powers of Satan, and the influence of

> good old age, and when they have lived while they desire life, may
> they die in peace, and be received into the mansions of eternal life,
> and enjoy a celestial glory forever and ever, even so, amen.

That’s how Brother John Wilkie’s donation was recorded on page 449 of
the Book of the Law of the Lord. Let’s discuss the contents of the
passage and then discuss what it meant to have a person’s name and
contribution included in the Book of the Law of the Lord.

First, the content of John Wilkie’s questions, Jo’s instructions, and
Jo’s blessings upon the Wilkies after the contribution was made. The
law of consecration as it was used in Kirtland could be used as a
euphemism here during the Nauvoo era. Consecration in Kirtland was the
act of dedicating all of one’s property to the bishop’s storehouse to be
controlled by the United Order, the church’s communalistic property
controlling entity. The law of consecration was how Jo was able to
vacuum up all of the Mormon leadership-owned businesses in Kirtland and
use their income for his own personal gain. This worked until it didn’t
and he ran most of the businesses into the ground. However, in Nauvoo
the law of consecration was utilized more broadly. Tithing at the time
meant dedicating one in every ten days to the mission of the church. If
a person was unable to donate time, then they had to tithe resources
like livestock, property, or money. The law of tithing was essentially a
mechanism built into the law of consecration of dedicating one’s time,
talents, or possessions to the church. However, because this was the
rampant polygamy era of Nauvoo Mormonism, consecration could also refer
to John’s wife. This is a complicated issue to tease out and the record
as we read it from the Book of the Law of the Lord is just ambiguous
enough it could mean a few things.

First, John Wilkie was apparently apprehensive of donating to the church
because of the rumors about the leadership. That means polygamy. Where
it says “but \[, Wilkie,\] laboring under many fears and prejudices in
consequence of having in some degree given way to believe the base
reports circulated by individuals for the purpose of injuring the
authorities of the church” that means he believed the rumors of
polygamy.

What immediately follows is quite interesting. “His faithful companion
has persevered diligently, and with fervent prayer has called upon God
in his behalf, until she has realized her utmost wishes.” What could
that mean? Was she operating under the Law of Sarah and received her
spiritual confirmation that she was to accept of any woman John brings
home to be his second wife or she would be damned? Was she wanting a
sister-wife for some reason and both her and John had picked a candidate
they both could agree on? Was it her or John who was the instigator of
their coming plural marriage? Like I said, the entry is just ambiguous
enough that we could read a fair amount from it. Polygamy is almost
always perceived as a reward system for the men because that’s how it
was initially conceived, but it should also be noted that there were
plenty of reasons for women to benefit from it in different ways beyond
practicing it because it was a requirement for salvation and to enjoy
“the fullness of the blessings of the celestial kingdom.” Let’s face
it, in this Victorian era of repressed sexuality, for lesbians, polygamy
was about the best option available to them. I don’t mean to be crass or
sound insensitive here, please don’t misunderstand what I’m saying. In
many plural relationships, primarily in Utah but a bit in Nauvoo, wives
had a say in who their sister-wife would be. The more sister-wives they
had, the less time they’re forced to spend with the husband they
probably don’t love and the more time they spend with a partner they had
some sway in choosing. For a society that repressed women and sexual
expression outside of cis-hetero marriages, polygamy opened up a world
of possibilities for women that they otherwise could never access. So,
when I say that the line about John Wilkie’s companion calling upon God
until “she has realized her utmost wishes” could mean anything, it
really could mean anything.

Once John Wilkie coughed up the $300.28, the promises and blessings
flowed from the Prophet as long as they “continued to walk in obedience
to the commandments of God.” “may their hearts expand and become
enlarged… the light of eternal truth continually springing up in them
like a well of living water;… shielded from the powers of Satan, and the
influence of designing men, and their faith increase from day to day
until they shall have power to lay hold on the blessings of God and the
gifts of the Spirit”

This contribution and Jo’s many blessings on the Wilkies was all
recorded in the Book of the Law of the Lord, which actually is the
primary focus of our episode today and thus the title. What does that
mean?

Let’s take this opportunity to do a deep-dive on the Book of the Law of
the Lord. First, the contents: The Book of the Law of the Lord was
created in 1841 in a beautiful ledger book by Robert B. Thompson while
he was Jo’s scribe. Our examination of the Book of the Law of the Lord
will be broken up into three parts today. First, the content. Second,
the purpose. And third, the controversy.

The BoLoL, as I like to call it, was broken up into 3 separate parts. It
starts out with 9 of Jo’s revelations. These revelations are the smash
hits of Jo’s revelations; the billboard list of Jo’s theocracy-building
words of god. The content and context of each of these revelations bears
examination because it sets the scene for the purpose of the BoLoL,
which we’ll discuss after we cover the actual contents.

The first of these included revelations in the BoLoL was Jo’s first
official Nauvoo revelation in modern D\&C 124. This is the longest of
Jo’s revelations and it essentially establishes the city of Nauvoo as
the kingdom of God, a sovereign theocracy within the boundaries of the
United States. It is truly one of Jo’s most important and iconic
revelations and it’s the very first written words in this book, setting
the tone for the theocratic purpose of the book in general.

The next revelation it includes is a revelation about specific people
carrying out specific Nauvoo kingdom building operations dealing with
the Nauvoo House and what consecrating properties means. The revelation
following that is modern day D\&C 125 which tells the saints in the Iowa
territory what to do, which is essentially more kingdom building stuff
when they named the Mormon headquarters in Iowa Zarahemla. The project
of building a Mormon settlement in Iowa as a twin city to Nauvoo right
across the Mississippi river was quickly defunded and the resources were
instead devoted to the Nauvoo Temple and Nauvoo House hotel projects.

The included revelation after these two is really interesting as it
progresses further back in time to a rough time of Mormon history. This
was an unpublished January 1838 revelation that essentially adjudicated
the power of a previous revelation. That previous revelation was the
1835 edition of the D\&C section 3 verse 37. That published revelation,
titled “On Priesthood” reads as follows:

> 37 And inasmuch as a president of the high priesthood shall
> transgress, he shall be had in remembrance before the common council
> of the church, who shall be assisted by twelve counsellors of the high
> priesthood; and their decisions upon his head shall be an end of
> controversy concerning him. Thus, none shall be exempted from the
> justice and the laws of God; that all things may be done in order and
> in solemnity, before him, according to truth and righteousness.

This was the mechanism Jo built into his revelations for checking the
power of the leadership. If the presidency of the high priesthood,
meaning Jo and his councilors, does something, this verse governs the
presidency’s impeachment and the tribunal process required to remove
them. Now, the unpublished revelation included in the BoLoL provides
interesting context as the leadership was attempting to determine the
powers this verse provides and how far it extends. A little background
on why this was included and why the unpublished revelation in the BoLoL
is important. In January of 1838, the Kirtland church was melting down.
The Fanny Alger incident had occurred and hearings were held to
determine if this was adultery and Jo was to be removed for the charge.
The Kirtland Safety Society had failed and hundreds of Mormons had lost
thousands of dollars as a result. The Missouri stake of the church was
being run by Oliver Cowdery, D-Day David Whitmer, and John Goebbels
Whitmer who were all three pretty opposed to the way Jo was running
things. The Quorum of Twelve’s power was continuing to grow under Bloody
Brigham’s presidency. Hingepin Sidney Rigdon was Jo’s partner in crime
through all of this. Legal issues were a constant weight on the
leadership as Jo and Rigdon owed tens of thousands of dollars to
creditors throughout the country. A court ruling had just handed the
3-story printing and school building behind the temple into the hands of
non-Mormon creditors. Martin Harris had stood up during worship service
in the temple and said he’d only seen the gold plates with his
“spiritual eyes”. The Parrishite faction of Mormons, led by Warren
Parrish, had just stormed a meeting with pistols and bowie knives to
wrestle power out of Jo’s hands, which led to multiple legal complaints
and arrests. 1838 was a tough time for Jo’s leadership. The result of
the tribunal determining if Jo was in error sided with him, instead of
the will of the people. Jo had successfully got away with his crimes and
remained as president of the church. As a result, a faction of the
church organically formed to oppose Jo and they determined to
excommunicate him, leaving the Kirtland Temple in their hands. Jo,
Rigdon, and the Quorum of Apostles were forced to flee in shame under
the cover of night. This is all episodes 19-41 if you want a long
refresher on everything I just talked about. So, back to the BoLoL. This
unpublished revelation included in the 9 revelations at the beginning of
the BoLoL was given while Jo was on the run on January 12, 1838. He was
hiding out with some of the Twelve on a farm near Kirtland before
crossing the state toward the Missouri church. They asked Jo if the
ruling of the tribunal siding with Jo was binding on all stakes of the
church, or just the Kirtland stake. They’d need that revelation in hand
when they got to Missouri so the Missouri stake leadership, Cowdery and
the Whitmers, couldn’t hold their own tribunal and excommunicate Jo when
he got there. The functional provision reads as follows:

> Thus saith the Lord, let the first presidency of my Church, be held in
> full fellowship in Zion and in all her stakes, until they shall be
> found transgressors, by such a high council as is named in the above
> alluded section, in Zion by three witnesses standing against
> each member of said presidency, and these witnesses shall be of long
> and faithful standing, and such also as cannot be impeached by other
> witnesses, before such Council, and when a decision is had by such a
> Council in Zion it shall only be for Zion, it shall not answer for
> her stakes, but if such decision be acknowledged by the Council of
> her stakes, then it shall answer for her stakes, but if it is not
> acknowledged by the stakes then such stake may have the priviledge of
> learning for themselves, or if such decision be acknowledged by a
> majority of the stakes, then it shall answer for all her stakes.

So, in summary, the unpublished BoLoL revelation states that the
judgement of the Kirtland stake doesn’t hold for the Zion stake, meaning
the Missouri stake, unless the Zion stake agrees to the ruling. When Jo
got to Missouri with this revelation in hand, the Missouri stake wanted
their own tribunal to excommunicate Jo, so instead he excommunicated the
Whitmers, Cowdery, and W. W. Double-Dub Phelps and issued the Danite
Manifesto giving them all 3 days to leave town or suffer the
consequences. It was a hell of a power grab and it worked. The reason
this unpublished revelation was included was to put into place the
impeachment powers for the theocratic Mormon Kingdom of God that the
BoLoL was created to establish. We’ll discuss that further after we get
through the contents.

The next revelation included in the list of 9 was another unpublished
revelation further adjudicating the powers of the First Presidency and
what constitutes a stake. It says:

> Thus saith the Lord, verily I say unto you nay. No Stake shall be
> appointed except by the first presidency, and this presidency be
> acknowledged by the voice of the same, otherwise it shall not be
> count\[e\]d as a Stake of Zion. And again, Except it be dedicated by
> this presidency it cannot be acknowledged as a stake of Zion, for unto
> this end have I appointed them in laying the foundation of, and
> establishing my kingdom. even so Amen.

Therefore, the stake established by the Kirtland defectors who kicked
Jo, the first presidency, and the Quorum of Twelve out of Kirtland was
ruled to not be an officially recognized stake by the will and power of
God. This also granted powers to the first presidency claiming the BoLoL
as their constitution as the ruling body. If the first presidency didn’t
recognize a stake or chose to withdraw their recognition of a stake,
then it held no power or sway with the leadership of the church. The
previously unpublished revelation established the power play, this
unpublished revelation insulated that power play from being questioned
or nullified by a competing stake leadership.

The next included revelation is the Fishing River Revelation given at
the conclusion of Zion’s Camp, the first military expedition of Joseph
Smith in 1834 in response to the Mormons being kicked out of Jackson
County in 1833. We discussed Zion’s Camp with David Michael back on
episodes 30 and 31 of the show. It was a disaster but I suspect the
reason it was included in the beginning of the BoLoL is because of this
passage:

> Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of
> the celestial kingdom, otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself; and
> my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it
> must needs be by the things which they suffer.

The BoLoL also includes the revelation Jo gave during his
treasure-digging trip to Salem, Massachusetts back in August of 1836
stating, in part:

> And it shall come to pass in due time, that I will give this city into
> your hands, that you shall have power over it, insomuch that they
> shall not discover your secret parts; and its wealth pertaining to
> gold and silver, shall be yours.

Salem was an important and historical city in New England. This
revelation was obviously quite important to include in the introductory
revelations in the BoLoL.

The next included revelation is super interesting. It’s modern D\&C 87.
This is the revelation he gave about the American rebellion taking place
in South Carolina and the slaves rising up to overthrow the government.
That revelation states, in part,

> And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up
> against their masters, who shall be disiplined for war. And it shall
> come to pass, that the remnant who are left of the land, will marshal
> themselves, and shall become exceeding angry and shall vex the
> gentiles with a sore vexation.

This revelation being printed in the original book of Jo’s revelations,
the Book of Commandments, catalyzed the first Missouri uprising against
the Mormons in 1833 where the Missourians in Jackson County literally
burned down the printing press and whipped, tarred and feathered,
stabbed, and shot a small number of the Mormon leadership. For slave
states, like Missouri, this revelation was either a harbinger of a
coming slave revolution, or a direct declaration of war by abolitionist
New Englanders against Southern Democrats that were the majority in
Missouri. If we could boil issues down to brass tacks, this revelation
alone catalyzed Zion’s Camp, the exodus from Kirtland to Missouri, the
Missouri-Mormon War, leadership internment in Liberty Jail, the third
exodus to the state of Illinois and Iowa territory, and so many other
terrible events in Mormon history. However, because the wording is so
strong and it captured the true intent of the Mormon theocratic empire,
it should be no wonder it was included in the introductory revelations
to the BoLoL.

The final of the 9 included revelations was Jo’s response to the intel
of the Missourians violent treatment of the Mormons in Jackson County.
This revelation, when taken in context of the previously included
revelations, is an actual declaration of war against the United States.
This is included as modern Mormon D\&C 103 and the relevant passages are
as follows:

> Verily I say unto you my friends, behold I will give unto you a
> revelation and commandment, that you may know how to act in the
> discharge of your duties concerning the salvation and redemption of
> your brethren, who have been scattered on the land of Zion, being
> driven and smitten by the hands of mine enemies; on whom I will pour
> out my wrath without ~~mercy~~ measure in mine own time:… But verily I
> say unto you, I have decreed a decree which my people shall realize,
> inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the council which I
> the Lord their God shall give unto them. Behold they shall, for I have
> decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very
> hour,--and by hearkening to observe all the words which I the Lord
> their \<God shall\> speak unto them, they never cease to prevail until
> the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is
> again given unto the saints to possess it for ever and ever.

What follows these revelations in the Book of the Law of the Lord is
part 2 of the BoLoL. Part 2 comprises a chunk of Jo’s journal entries
covering the entire year of 1842 written in the hands of White-out
Willard Richards, Erastus Derby, Eliza R. Snow, and William Clayton, or
Quilliam Claypen as we call him. 1842 was a super-important year for
Joseph Smith’s history because it included the translation and
publication of the Book of Abraham, the introduction of the endowment
ceremony, Jo’s ascendency to Master Mason, the formation of the Nauvoo
Masonic Lodge, the Lilburn W. Boggs assassination attempt debacle, the
sharp and public removal of John C. Wreck-it Bennett from church
leadership as well as the orchestration of the campaign to discredit the
allegations made in his expose, Jo’s arrest in Dixon, Illinois and the
resulting near extradition to Missouri to answer for his crimes during
the 1838 Missouri-Mormon War, the introduction of the Anointed Quorum,
and half a dozen other issues of major consequence. 1842 may be the best
accounted for life of Joseph Smith’s entire ministry because Jo
constantly had a scribe by his side detailing the events of his everyday
life. It’s also interesting to see the transition from one scribe to the
next. The majority of White-out Willard Richards’s journal entries in
this part 2 of the BoLoL are one or two lines. Once Quilliam Claypen
takes over the scribal duties for White-out Willard, many entries span
an entire page or more and dozens of letters are copied documenting Jo’s
correspondence with church leaders, political figures, and creditors.
The BoLoL is one of the greatest resources historians have for Jo’s life
because part 2 is such a detailed account of his daily activities.

Finally, part 3 of the Book of the Law of the Lord includes over 400
pages of donation records to the church from November 1841 through May
of 1844 just like the one we just read about John Wilkie and his
companion.

So, that’s the simplistic breakdown of the three parts of the BoLoL. I
say simplistic because the divisions aren’t actually this simple. The
last over 400 pages are accounting records for donations, but the book
isn’t broken perfectly of Revelations, then Jo’s journal, then
donations. The donations seem to have taken precedent from pages 27-
477, while the journal entries seem to be filled in the line breaks
between the donation pages. I’ll read a brief excerpt from an article
we’ll discuss a bit in a minute. The article was written by Alex D.
Smith and it was published in the Journal of Mormon History in 2012.
Alex Smith was one of the guys working on the Joseph Smith Papers
Project when they published the full scans and transcript of the BoLoL.
This is what Alex Smith says about the breakdown of the donations and
journal entries.

> These earliest entries in the book may be more appropriately termed
> “historical” entries rather than “journal” entries, as apparently
> the record was not immediately viewed as a journal for Joseph Smith. A
> number of headings in the early journal-entry portion of the book
> indicate a developing conception of the book’s purpose…

Smith goes on to describe the structure of these entries he labels as
“historical” instead of journal where they seem to be topically listed
regarding prophecy, or a meeting about a coal mine, or a visit from
various people selling land to Jo. Then Alex Smith goes on to write:

> Then finally, on page 58—thirty-two pages after the entries begin—the
> heading appears: “Journal of President Joseph.” Additionally, the
> first few months of entries are not always in chronological order, and
> occasionally entries bear the same date as earlier entries (for
> instance, the month of January 1842 contains several instances of
> multiple entries with the same date but different content)…
> 
> The journal entries and donations are kept concurrently, sometimes
> alternating every other page, until page 215…
> 
> The concurrent and interspersed journal entries and donations evince a
> unifying purpose or, at the very least, a common function of the
> recorder’s responsibilities. The alternating donations and entries,
> with their contemporaneous dates, and the degree to which they are
> interspersed, suggest that they were kept at the same time. On
> occasion, either the donations or journals were recorded for some
> time, with the other added in when time permitted. For instance, one
> sentence in the August 16, 1842,… is divided, mid-sentence, by
> twenty-eight pages of donations—an indication that space left between
> the donations was being used to record journal entries. At times, the
> journal entries and surrounding donations are concretely related, with
> one elucidating the other.

Now that we know the contents, part 1 of our discussion, let’s discuss
the second issue, the purpose of the BoLoL.

Alex Smith’s article provides an interesting window into what he sees as
the purpose of the Book of the Law of the Lord. First, keeping it as a
record was consistent with prior revelation. Jo had given a revelation
in the form of a letter to William Wines Double-Dub Phelps all the way
back in 1832, only 2 years into his ministry, that “It is the duty of
the lords clerk whom he has appointed to keep a history and a general
church record of all things that transpire in Zion and of all those who
consecrate properties… and also there \[their\] manner of life and the
faith and works and also of all the apostates who apostatize after
receiving ther inheritances.” This was later included as part of the
modern D\&C section 85. Alex Smith’s article speculates that the Book of
the Law of the Lord was consistent with this previous revelation as the
content of the BoLoL contains exactly those contents to a certain
extent.

Quoting from another portion of Alex Smith’s article, the BoLoL was the
first actual tithing book used by the church. But, it wasn’t a normal
accounting book the way we’d expect a donation ledger to read.

According to Alex Smith and the Joseph Smith Papers calculation, almost
80% of the BoLoL is just listing donations. Some are long passages, some
are just names with the amount. What’s really interesting, though, is
that the amounts were never totaled. So, what the donation list actually
amounts to is a guest list, not an actual accounting of how much has
been donated to the temple construction. This is noted by Alex Smith’s
article when he discusses the utility of the BoLoL.

> It is also the first financial record to combine the element of
> worthiness with the concept of the "tithe." As the donations were

You donate to the temple, you get access to the temple. The BoLoL is
where your donation is recorded and bound within this book. What is
bound on earth by the lord’s anointed is bound in heaven. It’s also very
interesting to note that donations were returned to some, usually women
whose husbands were serving missions. Once again, from Alex Smith’s
article:

> For instance, while Apostle Orson Hyde was on a mission (departed from
> Nauvoo on April 15, 1840), his wife, Marinda Johnson Hyde, on January
> 29,1842, "presented her offering for the Temple, a Table cloth value

> Two days after Marinda's offering, on January 31, 1842, Agnes Moulton
> Coolbrith Smith, the widow of Joseph Smith's brother Don Carlos,
> "presented her offering, four large, & twelve smaller glass, curtain
> knobs value. $8.—and 1 fir. for a coat collar. $2.—which was accepted

> may the blessings of Abraham be sealed upon them forever through the

> (71). A few days earlier on January 18,1842, Willard Richards records
> that another donor "offered a silver watch, purchased and saved by her

> children, her husband having neglected his family the past year;
> contrary to the principles of Righteousness, her offering was
> accepted, and returned to her again, for the purpose of assisting her
> to provide for her children, and the priviliges of the Font, given
> her. & her children. - and may the blessings of Abrahams God rest upon
> her forever & ever Amen

This is notable in that the Nauvoo leadership recognized the value of
the widow’s mite and how hard it was for families to get along who still
chose to donate when times were tough. They were compassionate enough to
return the donations and still record those people as having made the
contribution. Whether those widows or abandoned wives gave something in
turn to have their donation recorded is a matter of question and
entirely possible as 2 of the women Alex Smith listed in his paper were
Joseph’s wives when these donations were given and returned to them.

However, that just relates to the purpose of the donation portion. You
give money, you get in the temple. What about the other parts, the
Joseph Smith journal for 1842 and the 9 revelations at the beginning?
Alex Smith had this to say about the revelations in his article, which,
of course, you’ll find linked in the show notes. \[T\]here is no
apparent intrinsic relationship among the nine revelations.” In
response, all I have to say is, WHAT?\! How can the relationship
connecting these revelations not be apparent? We discussed the content
and context of all 9 in part one of this episode, they’re clearly Jo’s
hits of theocracy building. These were revelations included for the
implicit reason of running a theocratic empire. Anybody who reads them
together clearly isn’t seeing what I’m seeing, because the whole damn
book is titled “The Book of the Law of the Lord”. It was the book
established to be the code of the law of the lord to replace or
supersede the law of the land\! Each revelation works with the previous
and next revelation to form a system of governance of the church which
could be mapped to a larger system of governance.

This is how I see the plan. Nauvoo was established as the headquarters
of the church. The resolution would be passed declaring it a sovereign
territory within the boundaries of the United States. The Council of
Fifty was Jo’s parliament and he the theocratic monarch. The Council of
Fifty minutes contained the proceedings of the internal meetings and
were never meant to be public. The Book of the Law of the Lord was meant
to be public and essentially form the constitution of the Mormon
theocracy based on the laws of the lord, meaning the revelations given
through his prophet. The list of names, the people who gave time, goods,
or talents to the construction of the temple would be the elite list of
founding members of the Mormon theocracy headquartered at Nauvoo. This
idea is perfectly captured during the schism crisis when Bloody Brigham
Young was grabbing power left and right. In 1845, less than a year after
Jo’s death, Brigham commissioned a portrait to be painted by Seala Van
Sickle in which he’s standing next to a table with the Bible and the
Book of Mormon sitting on it. In his hand is a little book with “Law of
the Lord” painted on the binding. This book was supposed to be the
foundation of the American Mormon theocracy. That was the true purpose.
The compilation of seemingly disparate revelations at the beginning,
Jo’s journal, and the donations, when taken altogether, reveals how
important this book was supposed to be for the Mormon revolution.

This also exhibits something I neglected to mention on last week’s
episode. Jo’s journals were initially written with a tacit understanding
that one day they’d be public. The BoLoL included his first successful
attempt at actually keeping a regular journal. His 1842 journal is
peppered throughout the pages of the BoLoL and his subsequent Nauvoo
journals were included in 4 separate little notebooks that represent his
daily walk in Nauvoo. Understandably his journals are relatively
reliable but far from complete when it comes to his actual conduct in
Nauvoo, which is why historians are forced to other journals by Wilford
Woodruff, William Clayton, Eliza R. Snow, and a small handful of others
to illustrate what was actually going on. Let me reiterate this and be
perfectly clear. Jo’s Nauvoo journals were initially written so he could
present himself in a good light to the public when they were made public
at some point later in his life. His multiple times telling people to
stop practicing polygamy, his multiple denials of the practice, his
smearing of John C. Wreck-it Bennett for practicing “spiritual wifery”
contained throughout dozens of pages of his Nauvoo journals was recorded
with the understanding that they would be read by the public one day.

When a person writes a journal, it’s usually understood that they do so
with the intent of writing their experiences and internal thoughts about
them in a place that will be private during their life and hopefully not
public after their death. Jo, on the other hand, wrote his journal as a
PR stunt he could use in the future to clear his name of accusations or
provide an alibi. He died before those journals could be properly
utilized, but how they were best used was by White-out Willard Richards
and George A. Smith in compiling the History of the Church in the 1850s,
later published by B.H. Roberts under Joseph F. Smith’s presidency. Jo’s
journals are crucial to Nauvoo history but obviously slanted and written
in such a way as to make him a demigod.

All of that leads us perfectly into the third and final portion of our
episode talking about the BoLoL, the controversy. Part one established
the content and context, part two describes the purpose as I see it,
even if others are unable to draw the overarching conclusion I’ve done.
Now, part three we get to discuss the impact and suppression of this
book, because obviously this was withheld in the first presidency vault
and hidden from the public until very recently.

Historians have known about this book for well over a century. B.H.
Roberts, the greatest historian the church has ever had, likely saw the
Book of the Law of the Lord, possibly just when he was putting the
touches on volume 4 of the History of the Church and needed Jo’s 1842
journal to do so. He may have had restricted access just to the journal
portion of it under the watchful eye of Joseph F. Smith. The BoLoL was
initially in the first presidency’s archive, which is a bank-vault sized
safe of the most valuable and controversial documents and artifacts of
Mormon history. However, due to the sensitivity of the BoLoL, Joseph F.
Smith chose to keep it in his personal archive. Joseph F. Smith’s
personal archive, instead of being a bank vault, was a small safe that
could be loaded onto a hand dolly and moved around at a moment’s notice.
This personal safe retained the absolute most sensitive and damaging
documents in Mormon history like the Council of Fifty minutes, the
William Clayton Journals, Joseph Smith’s 1832 first vision account, and
a small handful of other documents, some of which have been released to
the public.

Only a very small number of men have been able to even see the BoLoL,
let alone open it, study it, and take transcripts. The first indication
we have of a historian having access to even see it after B.H. Roberts
comes from the diaries of Leonard J. Arrington. Arrington was official
church historian from 1972 to 1982 when the office was essentially
retired. His diaries were recently published by Signature Books in 3
books totaling over 2700 pages. He refers to the BoLoL a couple of times
and peripherally chronicles its journey through the archives by who was
able to see it.

The first time Arrington references the BoLoL is in July of 1972 when he
was barely 6 months into being the church’s official historian. That day
he went to lunch with Homer Durham. This is what he remembered from
their conversation:

> He told me about some of his experiences working for the Historical
> Department in \[the\] 1940s. He was doing research for the Gospel
> Kingdom, containing excerpts from the sermons and writings of John
> Taylor, and for other books and articles. He said this was in the
> early 1940s. He said the staff of the Chruch historian’s office
> allowed him pretty much free reign. Alvin Smith on occasion showed him
> material in the safe and he remembers seeing there the original copy
> of the revelation which called Heber J. Grant and George Teasdale to
> be members of the Quorum of the Twelve. He also saw there some letters
> of Joseph Smith, the Far West \[Missouri\] record, and the Book of the
> Law of the Lord. He does not remember seeing there the diaries of John
> Taylor.

The existence of the Book of the Law of the Lord was known of, but even
the official Church Historian didn’t have unfettered access to it. G.
Homer Durham somehow was shown the content of the First Presidency’s
vault by Alvin Smith in the early 1940s, but by the time the early 1970s
rolled around they’d been buttoned up much tighter.

Another passage in Arrington’s diary the following month of August 1972
perfectly illustrates the mentality of the church presidency with
respect to the archives and how hard the job of church historian really
was. Arrington was in a meeting with President N. Eldon Tanner and the
Prophet Harold B. Lee discussing the archives and this is what Arrington
remembers of the conversation.

> President Lee then said with respect to one of the items—making
> available the source materials in the vault of the First Presidency
> and in President Smith’s safe: “I am not sure how far we can go on
> this without investigating it more completely. There are some things
> that have been kept in our vault for more than a hundred years, and
> perhaps they should always remain there. For example, the seerstone
> and the law of the Lord—I don’t even know what that is, and there are
> some other artifacts in that same category.” I said, “Of course we are
> not interested in those items. They ought to remain in the vault of
> the First Presidency. We are thinking in terms of diaries and
> journals, minutes, and other such records that are necessary in
> writing history.” President Lee said, “The history or possession of
> many of these things goes back many years—before I ever became a
> member of the First Presidency. Brother Joseph Anderson was given care
> and keeping of many things and we will have to discuss it with him to
> see reasons why these things were kept in our vault. We agree with you
> that it needs investigation and thought and we will give it
> consideration and be in touch with you later.”
> 
> I said the main thing is that whatever we may have access to that we
> be given access to these as soon as possible so that we can use them
> in writing our history. Brother Lee seemed to nod his head in the
> affirmative to this suggestion.

This was in August of 1972. A wild card factor was also beginning to
influence the scene of Mormon history in the early 1970s which nobody
could account for, Boyd K. Packer. Leonard Arrington, along with a few
other scholars including Richard Bushman, conceived of an idea to create
a narrative of early Mormon history that accounted for and dealt with
controversial issues. Packer, being very well-read in the subject of
Mormon history, didn’t like the idea. Packer was capable of shutting
down New Mormon History and pushed to have the office of official church
historian retired. Arrington and Packer constantly butted heads. Harold
B. Lee was in his early 70s when he had this conversation with Arrington
about the seerstones and the Book of the Law of the Lord and publishing
about the artifacts. However, Lee died just a year later in December
1973. Spencer W. Kimball took over and the trifecta of evil, Benson
Packer and Peterson were on Kimball’s shoulder as the church was coming
under attack for racial issues, controversial Mormon history in the era
of Dialogue, Sunstone, and Mormon History Association. Packer
successfully lobbied Kimball to shut down New Mormon History and further
suppress documents like the Council of Fifty Minutes, the Book of the
Law of the Lord, the Clayton diaries, and dozens of other documents and
artifacts researchers were asking for and publishing about in these
secular academic fora.

In 1981, Boyd K. Packer attacked church historians in his talk titled
“The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect.” In that talk, in
no uncertain terms, he said “There is a temptation for the writer or
teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is
worthy or faith promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very
useful.” Packer railed against academics from top to bottom of the talk
and it was so controversial that the talk was initially suppressed, only
to be quietly published in a BYU Studies article a few months later
after enough pushback. If you want to learn more about this, go listen
to Whack Pack Attack, episode 33 of the Glass Box Podcast with Joe
Geisner. Needless to say, Packer decried Mormon History academia, issued
a statement against those wishing to attend Sunstone symposium, and his
all-out war against historians was in full swing in the early 1980s.

There was a huge issue though when it came to the Book of the Law of the
Lord. The Church History Department wanted to publish the Joseph Smith
journals, primarily the Nauvoo era books. But, his journal begins in
December 1841 in the Book of the Law of the Lord. So, if the church was
going to publish Jo’s journals, they’d have to publish the 1842 portion
included in the BoLoL. The only problem was that publishing just one
portion of an artifact with many other important entries in its pages
leaves a lot to be desired and looks like suppression of everything else
the BoLoL contained. That’s what it was, suppression, but the optics
looked bad. I’ll quote again from Alex Smith’s article about the BoLoL
from 2012.

> For today’s researchers, the journal entries in the Book of the Law of

Publishing the crucial resource of Jo’s Nauvoo journal while suppressing
the remainder of the artifact was an abrasive concept to Arrington and
other church historians. However, they attempted to do just that.
Arrington’s diary recounts when he received word that the diaries of
Joseph Smith would be published, including his 1842 journal from the
pages of the BoLoL.

> December 18, 1986—Thursday
> 
> Ron Esplin telephoned today to say that Elder Dallin Oaks had

> Packer and Oaks to be liaison with us to forward the project. Deseret
> Book to be the publisher. To be delivered to them in 1987. Dean Jessee
> to be the editor.

So, yes, the Nauvoo Joseph Smith journals would be published under the
watchful eye of Boyd Packer and Dallin Oaks while the remainder of the
Book of the Law of the Lord would remain suppressed. Even just
publishing the 1842 journal entries was music to the ears of Arrington,
Esplin, and many other historians who’d been asking for Jo’s Nauvoo
journals to be released for decades. Arrington writes:

> Ron was almost ecstatic, and said he was confident \[vice\] president
> Jae Ballif of BYU would be equally so. The is the first time the First
> Presidency have given us the go-ahead on anything since Elder Packer
> attacked the historians for being too negative.

Dean Jessee was the editor who published it not in 1987, but in 1992 in
his The Papers of Joseph Smith, Vol. 2: Journal 1832-42. Why did Jessee
finally get clearance to publish the 1842 Joseph Smith journal? Because
there wasn’t anything about polygamy in it because, remember, when it
was initially recorded Jo only recorded information he was okay with
eventually getting out into the world. He’d planned on his journals
being published at some point so it was censored from the beginning. He
never recorded anything in the 1842 journal about polygamy. In fact,
much of it tells a story about him constantly fighting rumors of
polygamy. Therefore, Packer and Oaks determined that the information in
Jo’s 1842 journal wouldn’t actually be damaging to the church and gave
Arrington and Jessee the green light as long as it was just the journal.

Many people were elated to finally have the Nauvoo journals published,
but Jessee’s publication of the 1842 journal was also widely known to be
simply extracts from the Book of the Law of the Lord. Historians knew
the BoLoL was still being suppressed and many greeted Jessee’s book with
outrage instead of elation. Jo’s 1842 journal is super important, but so
are the revelations, both published and unpublished included at the
beginning, and so are all of the tithing contributions that comprise
over 80% of the actual book. The whole issue was very frustrating for
many historians who felt like this wasn’t enough. It felt criminal to
only release a small portion of the Book of the Law of the Lord when the
remainder of its contents are so incredibly valuable and one-of-a-kind
to researchers. Fast forward to 2012, 20 years of historians howling at
the church to release the Book of the Law of the Lord finally drew out
an article published in the Journal of Mormon History, written by Alex
D. Smith, one of the historians working on the Joseph Smith Papers
Project, which discussed the provenance, content, and importance of the
Book of the Law of the Lord. We’ve read a number of extracts from that
very article today.

This Alex Smith article was published while the church was still
suppressing the Book of the Law of the Lord. When I say suppressing,
that word almost sugar coats what’s really going on. They were hiding
it. They knew there was information in it which could be damning so they
chose to keep it from the harsh light of academic scrutiny by shoving it
into a dark corner of their personal vaults and blatantly refusing any
researcher requesting access to it for any reason because the leadership
is scared of truth. The BoLoL is one of those truths that aren’t very
useful, according to Packer. They hid this artifact like they did the
seer stones, the first visions accounts, the first first-vision account,
the Council of Fifty minutes, the Clayton Journals which are still
suppressed, this is just one more thing to add to the list of stuff the
church has been hiding for decades in spite of historians knowing it
existed and repeatedly requesting access to it. Finally, in 2014 the
Book of the Law of the Lord was published in its entirety on the Joseph
Smith Papers, but with a caveat. Because the JSP had already published
Jo’s 1842 journal extracted from the pages of the BoLoL, they published
the high-resolution scans of the entire book, but only a transcription
of the revelations. If you want to read the 1842 journal entries and the
donation records, you have to find the page and read the handwritten
note yourself, which is in stark contrast to nearly every other document
uploaded on JSP where the full transcripts are available and indexed for
searching juxtaposed to the scans of the document.

The controversy of the Book of the Law of the Lord illustrates how
resilient the Mormon church is and always has been to critical
questions. People have known of this artifact’s existence for decades
and it’s been silently hidden away in a vault for over a century and a
half, completely closed to researchers with only a couple of exceptions.
Even the publication of just one part of it was tightly controlled by
the apostles. The remainder of the book being hidden away for 2 decades
after that journal portion was published has successfully hindered the
advancement of Mormon history academia because maintaining a false
narrative has always been more important than allowing verifiable
information to dictate the direction of the institution.

Alex Smith’s conclusion is particularly poignant in light of everything
we’ve discussed today.

> The Book of the Law of the Lord and later tithing volumes were a
> reflection of the Prophet’s ongoing conception of a “book of the law
> of God.” Perhaps the greatest importance of the book lies in its
> theological implication—a record decreed by revelation to record for
> heaven and earth the deeds and consecrations of the Saints. As a
> historical record of the early Church, the Book of the Law of the Lord
> is supremely significant.

I would add, it’s not only important for the theological implications of
fulfilling Joseph Smith’s record-keeping revelations, but the real
importance of the BoLoL lies in its theocratic implications of
fulfilling Jo’s greatest dreams, a complete and total overthrow of
society, seating him atop a theocratic throne of a Mormon America. For
its contribution to contextualizing the mindset of the founding prophet
of Mormonism, calling the Book of the Law of the Lord “important” does a
disservice to the artifact. It’s one of the most integral pieces of
Nauvoo Mormon history and the church successfully masked it from the
world for longer than any of us have been alive. Any institution this
bulletproof to facts which relies on lying and misrepresenting or
obfuscating reality to thrive is not an institution worthy of adoration.
It deserves nothing better than unequivocal condemnation and exposure.
In the words of the late and terrible Packer himself, Some things that
claim “truth” are not very useful.
