Ep 192 – Called and Numbered with the Chosen

On this episode, propaganda flies all directions about the Mormons. A
New York Tribune article from January 1844 made waves across the nation
with some vicious claims about the Mormon empire in Nauvoo. The article
was picked up and reprinted in many news outlets, especially in the
cities neighboring Nauvoo. In answer to this, the Quincy Whig received
pushback from Mormons for publishing the Tribune article, but the Whig
made a commitment to journalistic integrity. A Mormon wrote a letter to
the editor of the Whig which they indulged him by publishing it. After
all of this, Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, in the midst of a legal dispute
over polygamy and slander, published an article in the Times and Seasons
which carved out a future of Mormonism that openly practiced polygamy.

With Joseph Smith’s presidential campaign at the early stages, the
propaganda machine was in full force. As articles circulated revealing
the finer points of the theocratic Mormon kingdom, articles were devised
in response.

I offer as an example of this, an article published as a letter to the
editor of the New York Tribune which caused a significant amount of
public attention to be focused on the Mormon kingdom. It is a remarkable
article, but the resulting propaganda and public’s response to the
article is even more fascinating to me. To preface the article, it’s
almost as if the person was a local of one of the neighboring towns to
Nauvoo, had heard the constant rhetoric from the prophet and his
cronies, and devised an exact and direct response to each point. We’ll
discuss what each of those points are as we go through the article.

First point this article attempts to deal with is the economic growth
the areas experienced as a result of the Mormon refugee crisis. This was
a constant mainstay of Jo’s rhetoric, how industrious the Mormons are.
Whether it was from the pulpit, published in the Times and Seasons or
Nauvoo Neighbor, or in letters to people considering migrating to Nauvoo
from anywhere in America or Europe, the economy in Nauvoo under Jo’s
inspired leadership was better than it had ever been. Ignore the
unemployment, the insane inflation and inability of people to afford
housing, Jo’s economy was the strongest it had ever been. Nauvoo’s place
on a jetty into the Mississippi placed it in the most favorable location
in America and the whole area was reaping the benefit of Mormon
industry.

This deals with the rhetoric that Nauvoo was a safe and secure place to
visit. The Mormon leadership were criminals and were using the Nauvoo
Municipal Court to cover up rampant theft and robbery happening all over
town. In accordance with Jo’s Missouri revelations in 1833 and 38, the
Mormons were taking the property of the gentiles, the non-Mormons, and
consecrating it to the church. A point I neglected to make last week
about the Book of the Law of the Lord has to do with this. People
consecrated or tithed property to the temple through 1841-44 and
hundreds of contribution records follow page after page through the
BoLoL. Well, there was nothing stating that the Mormons had to
contribute their OWN property to the temple, just that any property
could be consecrated to the building of the temple. With this
interpretation of the evidence, some of the lines denoting material
consecrations to the temple could have been used as evidence of theft by
the Mormons. I’ve never seen a study done on this and I don’t suspect
one has been done yet because the BoLoL was only opened to research like
4 years ago, but I wonder if it might be possible to match the criminal
records of theft and robbery with items donated or “consecrated” in the
BoLoL. How interesting would that be?\! A Nauvoo municipal hearing is
held for theft of a trunk of clothes and a saddle, the accused are
acquitted by Joseph Smith and then 2 days later there’s an entry in the
Book of the Law of the Lord for some clothes and a saddle. Hmmm… food
for thought. Let me know if any of you have seen research on this.

In any case, this person goes on to talk about the average member not
being the villainous knave that is the prophet.

This is a super interesting point in my eyes. People who are just
genuinely bad people see Mormonism as a land of refuge and opportunity
and they “join” to prey on their fellow men, or on women in many cases.
Mormonism did provide some interesting and appealing propositions to
those who were less scrupulous in their personal ethics. Lots of money
to be made, women to be sealed to in the New and Everlasting Covenant,
and a banana republic legal system to protect the guy from any legal
troubles. Jo surrounded himself with these people, each member of the
high priesthood less moral than the previous, none of them idiots. It’s
no wonder folks like John C. Wreck-it Bennett and Joseph H. Jackson made
their way up the leadership ranks so quickly to gather information for
their exposes. Bad men tend to congregate like dragging a magnet through
dirt and Jo was the worst of them all, which, is where the focus to
which this article next turns its ire.

Obviously, this article is painting with a pretty broad brush, but it
should be notable that life wasn’t great for a lot of Nauvoo Mormons. A
core of unyielding sycophants may have painted the illusion that every
one of the 15,000 people living in the area venerated Jo as their king
on earth, but a lot of people sacrificed a lot to be a member of this
church, which understandably left many of them jaded by what had
happened to them. It also claims that Jo had created a system of vicious
competition which has certainly survived in the Salt Lake City church
today, and that some of his purported loyal leadership were actually
just waiting for the opportunity to either leave or ascend to the
presidency. This system of competition, understandably, came as a result
of the carrot and stick approach Jo had to leadership. You’re loyal and
help the church out, you gain the prophet’s favor and plenty of worldly
comforts. You’re an enemy of the church or a dissenter against the
prophet, you suffer his wrath and may even enjoy a nice late night visit
from a Danite like Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell.

Did you know Joseph Smith had wine and tobacco brought to him when he
was in Carthage jail?\! That’s a frequent “anti-Mormon” talking point
some of you may have heard or used at some point. Well, he also passed
laws as Mayor that he was the only person who could sell alcohol in the
entire city and his police force vigorously enforced these laws. Jo
didn’t just drink alcohol, he made sure he was the only guy who could
legally sell it in Nauvoo and used his position as mayor to set himself
on top of the alcohol monopoly in the city. If folks wanted to get
alcohol at prices which weren’t exorbitant from Jo, they’d have to
travel about 15 miles to the nearest grog shop which wasn’t in the city
jurisdiction. In a car, that’s no big deal, in a wagon or carriage, that
was quite a burdensome requirement.

Jo was in a dangerous position in Nauvoo. He could make the rules to the
game of reality and play it however he wanted to. He made the rules
allowing him to act any way he wanted to, and following the rules was
elective for him, but everybody else had to play by his rules of his
game. We see how a lack of checks and balances like this can be very
dangerous to the regular order of law. We have a system set up and a
general social contract of abiding by that system and not breaking it,
then a guy comes along and flaunts those social contracts, makes his own
rules, and we’re all left with our hands up in the air wondering what
the hell to do to get rid of them. Thing is, Jo had long since ruled
that he couldn’t be impeached and his cabal of legitimately loyal
sycophantic leadership had made sure that power resided solely in him.
This worked for him until the only remaining solution was vigilante
justice, which was swift and far too late.

This article was published in the New York Tribune in late January 1844
and was reprinted all across the country for the months of February and
March, while Jo was putting the word out about his presidential
campaign. The cogs of the Nauvoo propaganda machine began to churn and
the Times and Season printed an article which was supposedly written by
somebody who happened to travel to Nauvoo and write a good yelp review
of the city and its prophet-mayor-general-tavernkeeper apropos of
nothing, of course. I’ll tell you, this reads like W. W. Double-dub
Phelps wrote it as he was one of Jo’s primary propaganda officer, but
reading wordprints with this little data and a nearly infinite well of
possible authors means I have no way of proving it.

Such a resounding approval of Jo, Nauvoo, and the Mormons at large would
have been welcome news for anybody keeping up with the Mormon
controversy, or maybe it would have struck them as the propaganda it
was, who knows. I would also point out here that the Times and Seasons
had a few thousand regular readers who would have read this, maybe the
letter was picked up by other newspapers, but it’s doubtful. However,
the number of readers who saw that New York Tribune article about the
Mormon villainy was probably a few hundred thousand nationwide,
especially with the reprinting in other outlets. There were about 2.5
million people living in New York in the 1840s and a lot of them read
the New York Tribune. More people knew about how bad the Mormons were
than there were people who held them in high regard.

Even so, that New York Tribune article generated some skepticism from
others who sent letters to the editors of newspapers which had reprinted
the article. The Quincy Whig, for example, published a response to some
of the pushback they received from citizens who didn’t hold such caustic
views of the Mormons.

That last part was true. The Mormon leadership renewed a crusade against
the Quincy Whig and other newspapers in the next public meeting when Jo
said “we will whip the mob by getting up a candidate for President. When
I get hold of the eastern papers (The New York Tribune) and see how
popular I am, I am afraid myself that I shall be elected;…” It’s clear
that Jo delighted in his name being had for good and evil over all the
nation. Press is press and every national newspaper that carried his
name was another like or retweet that made him more popular. Alexander
Hamilton saw this failing in his very first federalist paper, which is
all the more poignant in 1844 as he’d only died the year before Joseph
Smith was born and the experiment of American democracy had yet to prove
itself. I offer a brief reading from Federalist Paper 1 to illustrate
his seemingly transcendent observations.

The various articles going out about the Mormons were generating fuel
for the persecution narrative, and that was dangerous. This was pointed
out in a letter to the editor of the Quincy Whig as the articles
published there only became more caustic towards Joseph Smith and the
Mormons. The person had read the original article reprinted from the New
York Tribune that started our conversation today and then he’d also read
the editor’s defense of publishing the article. These were his thoughts
after consuming both articles which was reprinted in the Times and
Seasons of March 15, 1844. The sentiments captured in this article are
absolutely terrifying and illustrate the mind of many Mormons thinking
Jo would be their savior. The ambitions for him to become king of the
world were far from secret, even if the specific plans to make it happen
were.

Terrifying\! Those, like the author of this letter, who failed to see
the error of their ways simply baffle me. You can’t have religious
freedom if the nation in question is ruled by a specific religion, be it
Mormonism, Catholicism, or Sharia law. Where do non-believers in
Mormonism exist in this man’s dystopic view of a Mormon nation? Where do
they have place? There’s an implicit mindset which informs this
worldview and that is of the second coming. The second coming will
happen and Jesus will reign personally over the earth and all
non-believers or heretics will be burned up like chaff and those tough
questions never need to be answered. Like some kind of magic cleansing
fire, everybody who isn’t a true Christian will catch fire or turn into
a pillar of salt or something. But, because the second coming hasn’t
actually happened yet, every time somebody actually tries to build god’s
kingdom, that whole killing of heretics thing is a duty that falls on
the people building the kingdom. It’s people responsible for killing
other people for not believing in the right god. Whether they be
indigenous peoples of America refusing to convert to Christianity or
Muslims in Iran people successfully brand as “terrorists,” religious
purity requires cleansing the impure. That’s why America’s final
frontier of rights must lay at the tattered bricks of the foundation of
the church-state separation wall. Non-Mormons aren’t allowed to live in
a Mormon America and that fact is just as much the case today as it was
in 1844 when Jo was trying to build his Mormon American theocracy.

> Whoever are to be the honored instruments in carrying forward the ark

> whether the Monks, the Methodists or Mormons, or any of them; yet it
> will certainly be that people whom the Lord shall choose.

That paragraph says a lot, doesn’t it? America will be the Christian
promised land, whether it be the monks, Methodists, or Mormons who build
it, we will live in a Christian America. Anybody praying to god to save
the world who maintains a wall of separation between church and state
perpetuate strife and confusion. They’re hypocrites who can’t be
tolerated. They’re moderates who unflinchingly give ground to radicals
of their same creed.

This mentality is infuriating to yours truly; it’s maddening. The Mormon
who wrote this is so quick to trot out the persecution complex and play
victim while simultaneously neglecting to realize he’s the victim of
Joseph Smith in the first place. Instead, he views the “much
tribulation” which he’s suffered as a result of religious persecution
instead of Joseph Smith being a monster. It’s the same mentality that
cries foul about 18 dead Mormons at Haun’s Mill but doesn’t even add a
footnote to a history book about the Timpanogos massacre and beheadings,
the Bear River massacre, the Circleville massacre, and dozens of others
resulting in the unjustified deaths of thousands of Indigenous people.

Hamilton put it so well:

Joseph Smith was such a champion of liberty, fairer and more industrious
than any other man. To quote from one of our articles today:

> I have found him as familiar in the cabinet of nations as with his
> Bible; and in the knowledge of that book, I have not met with his

> Smith begins where other men leave off.*

Everything the Mormons suffered was because Jo’s avarice to ascend to
higher and higher offices of political, religious, and populist power.
The mind which created this response to the Quincy Whig is some kind of
warped cult Stockholm syndrome that may be the sole longest-lasting
impact of Jo’s legacy. These people were damaged by his actions, their
perceptions of reality molded and shaped by the man profiting from their
anguish. They cry oppression not when considering their own
circumstances, but when people attack the man standing on top of their
crushed freedoms and autonomy.

The worst part about the entire article is he claimed the original New
York Tribune article was full of falsehood and misrepresentation. It
wasn’t. “It is so strongly tinctured with the bane of falsehood, slander
and reproach, that it can do the Mormons no harm; for every person who
has been to Nauvoo and witnessed there the fruits of industry and
untiring perseverance which exhibit themselves both in the city and on
the wide-spread prairie, must confess that the statements in the above
named article are false;” Don’t talk bad about my supreme leader,
especially when he’s done so much for us and the Nauvoo economy is
better than its ever been. But, the two ordinances it talked about, the
arresting power of the constable and pardoning power being removed from
the Governor, and the other of Jo creating an alcohol monopoly were both
real. They’d been printed in previous editions of the Times and Seasons
pursuant to the Nauvoo Charter which required public notice of any
ordinances passed before they went into effect.

As for this passage: “Of the Prophet himself, none who know him can
respect him. They cannot respect him for his sincerity -- for he cannot
be sincere; he cannot be the victim of his own delusion. They cannot
esteem him for his piety -- for he does not even profess to be pious --
and he is notoriously the greatest blasphemer and railer in the
country.” Is that the slander and reproach the person is talking
about? Those are opinions. Now, New York v. Sullivan, the standard
supreme court case by which slander and freedom of speech cases are
largely judged by, wouldn’t come along for another 100 years, but the
sentiment predated the court ruling. These are opinion judgements, not
statements of facts. For example, I can say that Russel M. Nelson
deserves as much respect and adoration as an Alzheimer-ridden Voldemort,
he looks like a 3-year-old potato stretched over the skeleton of a
lizard from a nuclear bomb testing site, and his brain is just
nickelodeon slime and none of that is slanderous as they’re personal
opinions and gross exaggerations that no reasonable mind would construe
as legitimate claims to fact.

That Mormon respondent to the New York Tribune article is just wrong at
the factual assertions, but it’s wrong on a deeper level. It began by
saying the article was too poisonous to have any real effect on the
Mormons. Well, what it did do was further prejudice the mind of the
public toward Joseph Smith. A Times and Seasons article with a couple
thousand readers responding to New York Tribune article with a couple
hundred thousand readers has a greater impact on the mind of the public
than can easily be measured. Like the modern Washington Post publishing
the story that the Salt Lake City church is hoarding over $100 billion.
WaPo has a few million readers and the Deseret News response has a few
thousand regular readers. What was the impression the public took away
from the story? Does the public remember the Deseret News response and
the op-eds from BYU professors who say they’re glad the church has the
money, or that the church having so much money proves it to be a good
steward over the kingdom of god? Or, do people remember the WaPo article
about the $100 billion nest egg the Mormons are sitting on? You wonder
where myths of dragons sitting on piles of gold originate…

Needless to say, the media was having a field day with the Mormons in
March of 1844 and it wasn’t long before the dissenters reacting to the
constant onslaught of scandals finally reacted in a way which proved
fatal for the prophet and his closest advisor and personal sidekick.

Speaking of Jo’s sidekick, Hyrum Smith, he was still caught up in
litigation with Orsimus F. Bostwick with polygamy. Bostwick made
allegations that Hyrum was preaching polygamy and Hyrum had sued him for
slander in Nauvoo. Dr. Robert D. Foster acted as Bostwick’s attorney.
The case was dismissed because it was the Nauvoo municipal court. Foster
told Jo he was going to appeal the case to the circuit court in
Carthage, which Jo… let’s just say he strongly advised Foster against
doing so.

With that as background, Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith published an
incredibly fascinating article in the Times and Seasons.

This was not the usual categorical denial of the practice of polygamy.
That’s a remarkable shift in the narrative from the multiple previous
denials over the prior decade. Notably, this was removed from the
History of the Church version published in the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century; only by Vogel’s Source and Text Critical Edition has it been
restored from the original manuscript drafts in bold text. Why? Why was
it removed? Why was it published by Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith in the
first place? What does it really mean?

I believe the reason it was removed alludes to the original purpose of
publishing it in the first place which allows us to peak into what it
really meant when it was published in March 1844. First, it talks about
a man “*having a certain priesthood*” preaching about “having as many
wives as he pleases”. This is true as the sealing power of the New and
Everlasting Covenant was still in early prototype phases. Sealing power
was manufactured by Jo to control who could preach polygamy and who was
allowed to engage in it. By Jo’s own direction in the July 1843
revelation, which is modern D\&C 132, it declares that only he has the
power of sealing in the New and Everlasting Covenant. However, many men
had taken many women as polygamous wives by that point and the
distinctions between spiritual wifery practiced by dozens of elites and
polygamy practiced only under Jo’s approval had yet to be defined. So,
Jo created his certain priesthood of sealing power and he had control
over what polygynous relationships were approved.

Then it denies that any such thing is going on in Nauvoo and any man who
is found preaching such things is liable to be brought before the High
Council for a tribunal and lose his preaching license. While this reads
as a blatant denial, when taken in context of what is said in the next
paragraph the statement becomes a bit more nuanced. However, reading
between the lines of just that statement, this meant that anybody who’s
preaching polygamy without approval will be disciplined. Only our
approved short list of men can preach such mysteries and if you’re not
on that list you’re putting all of us in danger.

So, on to the next lines. “an elder has no business to undertake to
preach mysteries in any part of the world, for God has commanded us all
to preach nothing but the first principles unto the world. Neither has
any elder any authority to preach any mysterious thing to any branch of
the church unless he has a direct commandment from God to do so. Let the
matter of the grand councils of heaven, and the making of gods, worlds,
and devils *entirely alone*:” This passage contextualizes the previous
lines. Only those who we approve of can preach mysteries. The doctrine
of exaltation, becoming gods with planets, grand councils of heaven; all
of these are super deep Mormon doctrine and all of them are tied to
polygamy somehow. How does one ascend to become a god? By taking at
least 3 wives. How does one make planets? By populating them with spirit
children from one’s multiple wives. How does one enter the grand
councils of heaven? By becoming a god; see above answers. These are the
greatest mysteries of Mormon theology and anybody preaching these deeper
points of doctrine couldn’t do so without at very least leaving the door
open for the New and Everlasting Covenant.

The next line is the most revealing of the entire article. “For when God
commands men to teach such principles the saints will receive them.”
This leaves the door wide open to declare polygamy publicly from the
pulpit at a later time. There simply is no other way to deal with that
line and there’s no other reason for it to be in there. But, to further
illustrate my point, it continues from there, “Therefore beware what you
teach\! For the mysteries of God are not given to all men; and unto
those to whom they are given they are placed under restrictions to
impart only such as God will command them;”. The mysteries, the New and
Everlasting Covenant, are placed under restriction and only the men who
God commands can teach them. “By this God will prove his faithful
servants, who will be called and numbered *with the chosen.”* Will you
be one of the chosen? Will you believe everything we tell you but only
when we choose to tell you? Will you obey?

“And as to the celestial glory, all will enter in and possess that
kingdom that obey the gospel, and continue in faith in the Lord unto the
end of his days. Now, therefore, I say unto you, you must cease
preaching your miraculous things, and let the mysteries alone until by
and bye”. Let the mysteries alone until all the chips are down, ducks in
a row, and all the puzzle pieces fall where they must. We’ll teach
polygamy and exaltation to godhood when the time is right. The article
ends with a threat. “Humble yourselves as in dust and ashes, lest God
should make you an ensample of his wrath unto the surrounding world.”
This wasn’t just a public statement; this was a warning to anybody who
may disobey. The wrath of god was a tangible reality to those who became
a threat to the church. The will and wrath of god was exercised by his
most faithful and elect who appear like a thief in the night.

When I opened this episode by saying the Mormon propaganda machine was
in full force, I meant it. Nauvoo Mormon propaganda was a versatile
machine and it had its way of controlling narrative outside the church
looking in as much as the internal mechanisms like who could and
couldn’t preach the mysteries of the kingdom. 1844 was a big year for
the church leadership under Joseph Smith. With so many moving parts, a
lot of decisions were constantly in the air but one thing I’m relatively
certain of is that had he not died in 1844, it would have been within
the following 2 years that he would have led the Mormons on their next
mass exodus outside the boundaries of the United States Government and
openly started practicing polygamy, just as Bloody Brigham Young had
done by 8 years after this very article was published. All the headlines
and national attention turning towards the Mormons forced Jo to
calculate many complex forces into his equations, but his ultimate goal
of moving away from the boundaries of any law enforcement was at the top
of his to-do list. Why? So he could flaunt the laws with impunity and
finally build his theocratic empire with his harem of wives and armies
of thousands. That fateful evening in the Carthage Jail shaped American
history and with little signals in the historical record like Hyrum’s
article here, I can’t help but wonder how the world might be different
if it had never happened.

Next on the chopping block is the King Follett discourse.
