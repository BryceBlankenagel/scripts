Ep 196 – Joseph Smith Assassination Plot

On this episode, we examine the times around General Conference of April
1844. Yes, the King Follett Discourse had been given, among many other
interesting talks, but what was going on that may have contributed to it
falling out of grand recognition we give it today? We examine the
concomitant events of scandal after scandal burning the emptying fuel of
the outrage machine. The Higbees, Fosters, and Laws create some problems
for the prophet, most notably, they devise an assassination plot for
Joseph Smith. Another man, Augustine Spencer, refused arrest by the city
marshal, John P. Greene, and Charles A. Foster, one of the conspirators,
draws a pistol on Joseph in broad daylight. With everything going on,
it’s no wonder the King Follett Discourse wasn’t more noticed at the
time it was given.

The King Follett Discourse had been given on the 14<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the church’s founding. It was well-received and the
propaganda machine cogs began to turn. A little context from the King
Follett Biography by Joann Follett Mortensen:

> No documentation survives about the response of King’s Family and
> friends to the sermon… that would forever be associated with King’s
> death as “the King Follett Discourse.” Certainly they would have been
> comforted to be told by their prophet that they would once again see
> King Follett and recognize him as they had on earth. Joseph Fielding,
> a British convert, recorded in his journal: “Joseph’s Discourse on the
> origin of Man, the Nature of God and the Resurrection was the most
> interesting Matter of this time.” More than fifty years later, Aroet
> L. Hale recalled it as “the gratest sermon that was ever preached in
> our Church.” Mary C. Westover, a young girl in 1844, wrote in 1906: “I
> though as I sat there that the Lord was speaking through Joseph.”
> Donald Q. Cannon reported in 1978: “My research assistants and I read
> some three hundreds journals at the LDS Chruch Archives and at Brigham
> Young University. Most did no comment on the discourse, however those
> who did made meaningful observations.” According to Cannon, examples
> of these observations were:  
> Wandle Mace: “a remarkable discourse” and “this most interesting and
> instructive conference.”  
> Edward Stevenson: “Grand funeral sermon of King Follett.”  
> Erastus Snow: “All were highly edified and highly delighted.”  
> Joseph Lee Robinson: The Prophet’s statements amazed him and caused
> him to wonder.  
> Alfred Cordon: “I was much delighted with the teachings and doings of
> the conference.”

This is notable. We tend to view the King Follett Discourse as the
culmination of Joseph’s ministry, his swan song if you will. However,
for most attendees it was just another sermon and didn’t particularly
stand out among his other sermons. Yes, he did expound on theology that
was unknown to many in the crowd, but most of the legacy of the King
Follett Discourse, all of the hype, was manufactured or later remembered
after it had reached mythical status. If that wasn’t the case then we’d
find journal entries replete with people expounding on the greatness of
the speech instead of simply casual mentions as the record actually
contains. Also notable is that people remembered it more mythically than
they recorded it in their journals. Two people who were children when
the discourse was given even remembered in the early 1900s that the
storm kicked up at the beginning of his speech and that Jo told the
attendees to pray for good weather and the clouds parted around the
grove, while the storm continued to rage all around them.

This illustrates how memory can be persuaded and even manufactured to
the point that people truly believe what they say to be true, even if it
isn’t even close to real and they only said it as a result of a half a
century of propaganda about the event.

Why? Why wasn’t it more memorable when it was given? Why aren’t there
hundreds of journal entries about the discourse? I hypothesize it’s
because there was so much going on in the air around the discourse.
Historically, it is greatly revered as a prominent milestone of Mormon
history, but for the majority of those in attendance it wasn’t viewed as
such at the time.

In order to turn the discourse into mythical status, the Mormon
propaganda machine needed to grind into action, which began in the May
1, 1844 Nauvoo Neighbor when a traveler published a piece about their
stay in Nauvoo during the 5-day General Conference when the sermon was
given. The person’s name attached to the article is simply SISSIMUS.
We’ll discuss that name in a bit. You’ll find a link to this article
in the show notes but I’ll read a few extracts and preface it by saying
it clearly reads as propaganda written by a member of the Mormon
leadership or possibly an outsider who was being properly wined and
dined by the prophet.

> On the morning of the 4<sup>th</sup> of April… I arrived at the city
> of Nauvoo; I was taken to the house of my wife’s brother, and, after
> passing the visit ceremonies, I was conducted to the residence of
> General Joseph Smith, who was then in the Council Hall… The
> introduction was formal… he responded to the introduction with
> expressions that would do honor to any station in life—and command in
> expressions of dispute, his merit of the abuse and ill treatment from
> individuals claiming to be Americans.

An interesting point revealed in this is that whether or not this
article was fabricated by the church leadership or it was an actual
traveler who wrote the letter to the editor of the Nauvoo Neighbor, it
shows that Jo would share his troubles and woes with just about anybody
off the street. The Mormons were a persecuted people and he had to make
sure every person who stepped foot in the city of Nauvoo knew it. Next,
the person attends the dedication of the Masonic Hall where it reads as
if the person was inducted into the society at sight. It’s kind of hard
to see what is actually happening here but it reveals the issue many
Masons had with Nauvoo. The Nauvoo Lodge was ascending too many men at
too quick a pace. A person has to pay their dues and do their time
before they are worthy to join the fraternity. Those who were given the
status of Master Mason as a favor the way Jo did were seen as unworthy
of the title by other Masons.

This is absolutely a sales-pitch from a Mason to other Masons about how
great Nauvoo is. I even cut a bunch of the descriptions of the Lodge
meeting from my reading just now because it’s just gratuitous details,
but that only further makes my point. This person could not sing his
praises high enough about how great Nauvoo is, how kind and personable
the prophet is, how cheap it was to stay, and how great the lodge
meeting was with amazing music and then he went to the inn, the Nauvoo
House probably, with the highest feelings, had the most wonderful
night’s sleep he’s ever experienced, then he woke up with a the most
agreeable sensations when he reflected on the previous day. But he only
further gets the VIP treatment from that point forward directly from the
prophet. If you were a powerful person and wished to have a good
weekend, let Jo know you’re coming into town and he’ll make sure you’re
properly taken care of.

> this morning Gen. Smith sent his coach to the house where I was,
> inviting me, with my wife, to visit him, and his companion. Obediently
> we complied and had the most happy interview, from whence he escorted
> us again to our home in the carriage, and from thence to the place
> appointed for the assemblage of the Conference; on my arrival there, I
> beheld the people gathering from every direction…

Then he goes on to describe the 10,000 people in attendance at the
discourse, the “between four and seven thousand females, of all ages and
statures, whose features condition the most solemn tones of a breathed
utterance on my part declare that the CHASTENING CREATOR was present,
and that man could be clad in virtue at such an interview.” Then he
talks about the actual meeting when Hingepin Rigdon and Hyrum
Sidekick-Abiff spoke. He relates the first vision story when “he
\[Joseph Smith\] recognized himself fourteen years old, and this day he
closed his guardian.” Rigdon “continued his history of the church, there
were assembled 20,000 persons, where the tiding of Revelation to the
world, and the DECREES OF HEAVEN were released… The portrayed Mormon
church, by Elder Rigdon was to me a feast, to any curious hearer a store
of knowledge, and to the enquirer for salvation, the way, the only true
way, as the scriptures emphatically declare to the unprejudiced;…” The
man then talks about witnessing some baptisms that day performed by Jo
himself, to the tune of 30 people. He relates a couple of points of the
discourse itself in relatively generic terms saying Jo “portrayed the
designs of heaven,” he spoke “in tones of truth and taste, elegantly,”
and Jo told the congregation of “his love and sympathies for the world
and its present educated character.” His summary is about the only
notable detail of the discourse observed by this person.

> The many disputed points of long existing sectarians, the
> reproclamation of God’s words, and command to a fallen race of men in
> its true, unpolished, and remedial tone, character, and efficacy \&c
> \&c “Repent every one of you, and be baptized for the remission of

Absolutely nothing about infants on thrones, eternal progression of
gods, spirit energy, gods organizing order from universal chaos, the
head god organizing a council of gods, nothing about other languages
being spoken from German to Greek to Hebrew, nothing about men becoming
gods or gods coming from mortal men, nothing about almost anything we
discussed in the discourse itself last episode.

The author of this letter to the Nauvoo Neighbor editor does include
answering some criticisms against Joseph Smith and the Mormons including
speaking in tongues and, of course, polygamy, which we’ll be discussing
in a minute.

> It says: “that by some means the word was spread abroad, that the
> Mormons in Nauvoo, all were pledge to be in common, men and women, and
> that their stores were as if of one family.

> individuals, who in the estimation of the prudent classes, and
> professing Latter Day Saints population, stand inferior to hell’s
> king, or the devil.  
> That the charge as published was false and could by thousands be
> established.”

And by thousands the denials of polygamy had been established, which
lends far more credence to the fact that they were going on among the
elite of the elite. The man apparently took up the accusations with Jo
directly, and this was how the exchange is reported.

> said he, I am indeed aware of the charges that you have unfolded, and

The person wraps up their letter to the Nauvoo Neighbor editor with

> I am satisfied that Nauvoo is a place of knowledge and that wisdom
> will be justified of her children. SISSIMUS

Okay, first off, I never cease to be astonished at how little the Book
of Mormon was used, especially in Jo’s late ministry. Everything goes
back to the Bible because the Book of Mormon had extinguished its
usefulness. Plus, most of the stuff Jo was teaching by 1844 was either
nowhere to be found in the Book of Mormon, or was contradicted by
passages in the book.

Second, this is pure propaganda. It even said, “Four clerks were engaged
in noting these masterly sermons, and those who may feel an interest in
their perusal, will feast mentally, as if on the richest luxuries of
imagination. They will be published.” This letter, whether it was
written by an actual traveler who happened to be a Mason whom Jo was
currying favor, or it was written by Double Dub Phelps or another of
Jo’s propaganda ministers, the point remains that it was created to
hype up the King Follett Discourse and General Conference more broadly.
Anybody interested in Mormonism, or even just interested in working with
Joseph Smith, bring some money and political connections to the Kingdom
on the Mississippi and you’ll be treated quite well with Jo sending his
personal carriage to take you around town, you’ll eat well, and, of
course, Nauvoo has four to seven thousand of the most beautiful women,
and all the bad things you hear about the Mormons can be answered by an
in-person conversation with the prophet, general, presidential
candidate, theocrat himself. The main point I’m making here is that the
King Follett Discourse, much like the Book of Mormon, wasn’t viewed at
the time the way we view it today.

Third point to make, and this goes to the last word in the editorial,
SISSIMUS. Pen names are as common today in online fora as they were in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century. There’s no way to know who this was, but
I’m led to believe it was one of Jo’s propaganda ministers. I asked a
couple of folks what they could make of the word. A friend, co-presenter
at the previous JWHA and soon to be copresenter at this year’s Sunstone,
as well as patron of the show, Brian Kassenbrock, a German studies
expert, helped me on the translation. Apparently sissimus was an adverb
basically meaning greatest. From his email: ““Sissimus" occurs on page
91 of Versuch eiener Lehre der lateinischen Sprach mit dem Motto: nicht
zu viel, nicht zu wenig, (Effort to Teach Latin on the Motto: not
Too Much, not Too Little ), Munich 1816, as a form of the highest form
for certain adverbs or adjectives, e.g. great, greater, greatest.  It
would fit into the German speaking community around Joseph well and it
would seem that whoever used it was well educated and impressed by the
sermon.” Essentially it was 19<sup>th</sup>-century German for third in
the progression of great, or greatest. Clever name, to say the least. So
we know what the moniker means, who is it? I haven’t found any other
editorials in the Nauvoo Neighbor or Times and Seasons bearing the same
name so I don’t have a larger sample size from which to triangulate the
true author. However, I do have friends who’re historians of Nauvoo, one
of which is an assistant professor at Sam Houston State University who
recently published a book titled Kingdom of Nauvoo, Benjamin Park. I’d
like to get him on the show once I’ve had a chance to read the new book,
but I did tweet at him the screenshot asking if he had any idea who it
was. He didn’t know off the top of his head who it was, but added “Given
JS’s closest advisors and secretaries often wrote anonymous editorials
as if they were outside observers, I wouldn’t put it past William Phelps
or Willard Richards writing this.” The Nauvoo propaganda machine was a
powerful tool and Double-Dub had long been helping to manufacture the
propaganda, while White-out Willard Richards comprised the earliest
prototype of the correlation committee to make sure everything fit in
Jo’s early history and the broader scheme of the narrative they’re
working to weave, and then John Taylor as editor would make sure to cull
any grammatical mistakes to make it ready for mass-production. Ben Park
also said it may have been Alexander Neibaur given the German heritage
of the word, but Phelps would’ve certainly been capable of it.

I guess my overall point is, should we revere the King Follett Discourse
the way we do today when it was clearly hyped up by the propaganda
machine and obviously wasn’t viewed contemporarily the way it’s viewed
today? Why wasn’t more notice taken at the time? I believe that times
were so chaotic and scandalous at the time that the people merely viewed
it as another sermon. Allow me to illustrate my point.

In that same issue of the Nauvoo Neighbor, they continued to deny
polygamy and increase interest in the Prophet’s presidential campaign.

Friends and Fellow Citizens:

Combatting sexual scandals in the midst of running a presidential
campaign was foremost on everybody’s mind. The April 1844 General
Conference wasn’t known at the time to be Joseph Smith’s last general
conference, otherwise people probably would have taken more notice of
his speech. Beyond that, with the onslaught of the fake news Warsaw
Signal and New York Tribune, just like today, people were getting worn
down by outrage fatigue.

And outrage it was. Scandals have a diminishing return to stop a person
from committing more scandals. The first scandal, the first outrage
happens, and if the people don’t do something about it, like they rarely
do, the next scandal carries less weight and public force. Multiply
scandal by scandal and eventually people are sick enough of the cycle
they stop paying attention or caring because the scandal is the new
baseline.

However, there were those who remained vigilant in the face of a
constant losing outrage battle. The Higbees, the Laws, and the Fosters.

All three of these families have tangled with Jo a few times, largely
around the issue of polygamy. Polygamy would prove to be the ultimate
downfall of the prophet. Back on episode 173 we read through a pamphlet
titled A Voice of Innocence From Nauvoo. It’s a rag of propaganda full
of denials that polygamy was happening and it was done in response to
the Orsimus F. Bostwick trial against Hyrum Smith where Smith had sued
Bostwick for slander and the Nauvoo court, chaired by Jo, had fined
Bostwick. Bostwick’s lawyer was Francis M. Higbee, who, with his brother
Chauncey Higbee, had suspected Jo of foul play in the death of their
father 2 years previous. This was insult to injury and Francis Higbee
threatened to appeal the case to the county seat, Carthage. Jo’s reply
was fitting for a man losing control of the situation.

Vogel HoC 6:276

> I told Higbee what I thought of him for trying to carry such a suit to
> Carthage; it was to stir up the mob, and bring them upon us.

At a public discourse Jo gave on March 7<sup>th</sup>, he railed against
Higbee and Bostwick for seeking appeal and their general frustration
with the Nauvoo Municipal Court system. We’ll talk extensively about
Francis and Chauncey Higbee in an episode coming up VERY soon so stick
around for that. Here’s what Jo said about Francis Higbee and Bostwick.

6:263

> Those who complain of our rights and charters are wicked and corrupt,
> and the devil is in them.
> 
> The reason I called up this subject is, we have a gang of simple
> fellows here who do not know where their elbows or heads are; if you

> expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wicked men.

To these remarks, another member of these three families, Charles
Foster, spoke up and Jo fined him $10 on the spot for disturbing a
church meeting, which was also an ordinance of Nauvoo. Jo also suspected
Charles Foster of being the author of the New York Tribune article we
read on episode 192, which burned a fire through Nauvoo, the surrounding
non-Mormon settlements, and the nation at large with the size of the New
York Tribune’s readership. Jo didn’t have any proof it was Charles
Foster, but he was a man guided by hunches and gut feelings and he
thought he had this one nailed.

Another issue cropped up with the Foster brothers, Charles and
Bob-the-builder Robert D. The situation was reported in this same issue
of the Nauvoo Neighbor, meaning it had probably happened in the second
or third week of April 1844.

To preface what happened that day, Jo suspected these families were in a
plot to assassinate him. On March 24 he’d given a speech that is quite
remarkable because it reads full of desperation, like he’d just received
intel of the conspiracy.

> I have been informed by two gentlemen that a conspiracy is got up in
> this place for the purpose of taking the life of President Joseph
> Smith, his family, and all the Smith family, and the heads of the
> church. One of the gentlemen will give his name to the public, and the

> Missouri, and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the people
> that I wanted to kill and put out of the way. I won’t swear out a

Yeah, but the king is never guilty and Jo couldn’t just imprison these
guys on the word of one of his cronies telling him there was a plot to
assassinate him without running the risk of them issuing a writ of
habeas corpus and Jo being in violation of the constitution. He had a
weird relationship with the constitution. He was happy to leverage it
for his benefit and abided by some of the amendments while ignoring or
choosing to interpret others however he pleased. However, with how much
legal trouble he’d been through with writs of habeas corpus, maybe
imprisoning these guys was too hypocritical for even Jo to palette. He
continues

> I will give the name of one of the gentlemen who have divulged the
> plot; his name is M.G. Eaton, he will swear to it; he is a bold
> fellow. Joseph H. Jackson said a Smith should not be alive in two
> weeks, not over two months anyhow.

Sidney Rigdon took the stand to follow up on Jo’s remarks about this
assassination conspiracy.

> A conspiracy does exist with the persons that have been named, It is
> one of those kind of associations that Could not exist in any thing
> except against the kingdom of God.

That logic is baffling to me but he wasn’t speaking this to a
logic-driven crowd. Basically, only the one true church would have
people in the leadership ranks trying to kill the leader. What couldn’t
you justify with this logic? Kill this person because they’re against
the Kingdom of God. Steal those horses because the people who own them
are against the kingdom of God. Our temple was vandalized because we’re
the one true kingdom of God. You see how this is a purely emotive
statement and therefore has absolutely no logical construction or
requirements?

He continues:

> I have viewed the nations of the earth and the way they are relaxing
> in power and the course they are pursuing. One hundred years will not
> pass away till there would not be a man or woman on the earth, and
> nothing but the hand of God can save it, and this is why God would

> have is to destroy each other. (If only Rigdon knew what nukes can
> do). For soon nation will be against nation party against party the
> rich against the poor and the poor against the rich until they are
> destroyed from under heaven.

He goes on for a bit longer in his typical blowhard fashion, but then Jo
took the stand.

> In relation to the power over the minds of mankind which I hold, I
> would say it is in consequence of the power of truth in the doctrines
> which I have been an instrument in the hands of God of presenting unto

> Joe Smith) shall hew it down and cast it into the fire.

These are not just ethereal and abstract concepts; these are words of a
growing tyrannical regime that’s continuously being backed into a
corner. The outrage fatigue plaguing the mass of Mormons suffering under
the growing pressure of Joseph Smith’s thumb was a trend which couldn’t
be relied upon as it only takes one sharp prick to cut the thumb’s
tissue. From the side of the outrage fatigue creating the outrage in the
first place, it felt like a shrinking world; the walls of Nauvoo were
closing in and greater control was the only option. The more the people
remained subservient, the less Jo had to legitimately worry about his
life.

One more person took the stand during this March 24<sup>th</sup> meeting
named Orson Spencer. He puts a bow on the issues here even though his
talk came before Hingepin Rigdon’s.

> While listening to Prest. Smith’s remarks, I thought of a figure,
> i.e., if a physician was going to dissect a body, he would not be
> likely to begin at the limbs, but cut the head off first. So the
> adversary of the Saints has laid a plan to cut off the head of the
> church with the intention of scattering and destroying the whole body.
> It was so in the days of Jesus Christ, the enemies of truth sought to
> kill him, that the body might be destroyed;…

Here he gets to the crux of the evolving power dynamic in Nauvoo, the
Kingdom on the Mississippi, that the more persecution aimed toward the
prophet, the more people fight the kingdom, the more power is granted to
Jo. That’s true, until it wasn’t when the guy was dead.

> I once heard a man say who was opposed to this work, “that it might be
> true, but it gave Joseph Smith power.” True, said I, but if his power
> be subordinate to the power of God, it is right. If a man set up a

> source. God sets up kingdoms and pulls down kingdoms; this makes men
> mad who will not submit to the kingdom of God. We all know the result
> of the power of Moses, who was the representative of God.

Orson Spencer was drowning in the Kool-Aid with this statement. Nations
will rise and fall, but this nation we’re building happens to be led by
god, therefore we have total right to take over the government and rule
how we see fit. Anybody opposed to our kingdom will go mad because
they’re opposed to the will of God. This mentality has killed hundreds
of millions of people throughout human history. Orson Spencer really
drives the point home, with one of the very VERY few allusions to the
Book of Mormon given over the pulpit in Nauvoo.

This is pretty dangerous rhetoric and speeches like this being given
over the pulpit capture the religious supremacy as much as they create
it. Mormonism was to be the kingdom of God, and everybody opposed to the
mission of the church are enemies. We see where that landed the church
but prior history to 19<sup>th</sup>-century American history teaches us
where it could have landed the church. Rigdon even makes the case during
his speech that the Catholic church was responsible for killing 50
million people by this time throughout the medieval age. Orson Spencer’s
speech really makes clear the general mentality of probably the majority
of the Nauvoo Mormons at this time.

Orson Spencer also had a brother. Something happened with his brother,
named Augustine. Augustine and Orson Spencer got in a fight and when a
friend of the prophet who’d just given a speech like that is in trouble,
Jo backs them up… to a point, I guess. Jo honored loyalty and Orson
Spencer was loyal in addition to being an alderman in the Nauvoo
Government. When Jo heard of the fight, he ordered John P. Greene, the
city marshal, to arrest Augustine. A warrant was issued, and Pistol
Packin’ Porter Rockwell was on the lookout for Augustine Spencer.

At this time, Rockwell ran the Nauvoo taxi service with a carriage he
was given after his return from Missouri in 1842 when Governor Lilburn
Boggs was shot. As the city’s taxi driver, Port saw who entered the
city, who left, and who was going where when. Beyond that, he heard all
the gossip as people rode around and chatted among themselves. Port
wasn’t just the destroying angel of the Prophet, he was also one of
his little tweety birds about the town who was a constant conduit of
information to Jo.

Before marshal John P. Greene could find Augustine, Jo and Pistol
Packin’ Porter happened upon him and Porter served him with the
warrant and demanded Spencer accompany him and Jo to the Mayor’s office.
Now, the implications of this are pretty crucial to understand. When an
enemy of the prophet was discovered and they didn’t hold much social
clout the way the Laws, Higbees, or Fosters did, it wasn’t uncommon for
them to not be seen again. Either they’d flee or they would no longer
need to flee because they had a visit from Porter Rockwell or one of the
Danite Regulators like King Follett was before his death. Beyond that,
the city jail was in the marshal’s office, but Jo had his own private
jail cell in the Nauvoo Mansion, which also contained an office from
which he conducted the majority of his business. What happened in the
Nauvoo Mansion jail cell was anybody’s guess.

So, when Jo and Pistol Packin’ Porter told Augustine Spencer that he’s
going to the jail at the Mayor’s office, what might have gone through
his mind? What would go through your mind if you were being arrested by
Robert Duvall AND Marlon Brando. Understandably he refused to go. The
most ironic part of this is that he was found at an attorney’s office
where this all went down. I’d be willing to bet he was trying to get out
of the warrant.

When Augustine Spencer refused to be arrested, Jo told Porter to go
fetch John P. Greene, the Marshal. When Greene got there, he attempted
to arrest Augustine Spencer, who again refused. This situation began to
get completely out of control with men yelling at each other inside this
small office, Jo furious because his orders were being refused, Port
unable to do much because this was broad daylight and he usually
operated under the cover of nightfall, and John P. Greene unable to
physically remove Augustine Spencer from the office. Marshal Greene ran
out into the street where he snagged the first three men he could find,
attempted to deputize them and commanded them to arrest Augustine
Spencer to be taken to Jo’s personal jail cell in the Mayor’s office.

The three men Greene attempted to deputize were the wrong choice. They
were Chauncey Higbee, who’d become the recent target of Jo’s character
assassination, we’ll discuss it in coming episodes, and the brothers
Foster, Charles A. and Robert Bob-the-builder. Robert Foster had
recently been excommunicated, which we’ll discuss very soon as well, but
he was still the surgeon general of the Nauvoo Legion, Charles A. Foster
was in the Nauvoo Legion as well, and Chauncey Higbee was an
Aide-de-camp to John C. Bennett before Wreck-it Bennett had defected and
published his exposes. Chauncey Higbee was a Bennett crony and not loyal
to Jo, but he was never officially relieved of his command in the Nauvoo
Legion, he’d just been excommunicated around the same time as Bennett
for similar charges of spiritual wifery. Chauncey Higbee hated the
prophet, plus there were those old suspicions surrounding his father’s
death. Robert D. Foster hated the Prophet. Charles A. Foster was more
loyal to his brother than the prophet. These were three of the worst
possible guys for Marshal Greene to deputize to help Jo and Porter
Rockwell affect an arrest of an enemy one of Jo’s cronies.

When Greene commanded these officers in the Nauvoo Legion to arrest
Augustine Spencer, they refused. But it escalated beyond that. Jo
approached them to reinforce the command from his position as
Lieutenant-General and Commander-in-chief of the Nauvoo Legion. Higbee
and the brothers Foster swore they would not assist the General and
Marshal, instead yelling back that “they would see the mayor and the
city d---d, and then they \[still\] would not.” Without the help of
these three conspirators Jo had named in a sermon 3 weeks prior as
attempted to assassinate him, Marshal Greene eventually subdued
Augustine Spencer and left with him in cuffs to the Mayor’s jail.

However, Jo wouldn’t simply take this insubordination from people he’d
thought 3 weeks ago were trying to kill him. Like dogs who try to bite a
terrible owner, Jo tried to beat them to make them stop biting. He told
Pistol Packin’ Porter to arrest all three of them, Chauncey Higbee,
Charles Foster, and Bob-the-builder Robert D. Foster and fine each of
them $100.00 “for refusing to assist the officer when called upon.”
Which is a legitimate military charge, they disobeyed orders, but the
orders were bogus in the first place and Jo was a tyrant. The more
people who simply acquiesce to a tyrant’s commands without standing up,
the more said tyrant is appeased and the more their power grows.

Charles Foster took the charge of standing up to the prophet, with Jo’s
destroying angel by his side. He pulled out a double-barreled pistol and
pointed it straight at the prophet’s heart. This was the moment Porter
Rockwell was born for. He immediately attacked Charles Foster and the
pistol “was instantly wrenched from his grasp.” Disarmed and reeling
from the attack by Jo’s destroying angel, Charles Foster,
Bob-the-builder Robert Foster, and Chauncey Higbee exchanged harsh words
with the prophet and his enforcer saying, “declaring that they would
thank God for the opportunity of shooting \[Joseph Smith\].”

They were all fined and all appealed their cases to the circuit court at
Carthage. The public attacks became even more powerful against Higbee
and the Fosters as the remainder of April continued into May 1844.

The Nauvoo Neighbor stated:

> These individuals have lately become very notorious. R.D. Foster is
> the magistrate who was fined a few weeks ago for gambling; Higbee a
> *respectable* limb of the law who was fined for insulting the city
> officers; and C.A. Foster is a candidate for fame, lately fined for
> disturbing a religious congregation.

The character assassination conspiracy was in full swing against the
Fosters, Higbees, and Joseph H. Jackson, in addition to William and
Wilson Law. Now, the Law family was also beginning to make some problems
for the church, but in a more subtle way. William Law was in the
presidency of the church on the left hand of the Prophet. He carried a
lot of sway publicly, but Jo had labeled him a Judas and began
investigations into him and William Marks. We discussed that back on
episodes 178 & 179. Wilson Law was never into the church as much as
William Law, but both the Law brothers owned a fair amount of property
in Nauvoo. They’d privately expressed interest in divesting themselves
of their Nauvoo assets. The only reason for doing this would be to leave
the church and both of the Laws knew far too much to leave quietly.
Wilson Law was in the Government and Nauvoo Legion, William Law was in
the government, Nauvoo Legion, and church presidency.

The departure of the Laws would spell disaster for Jo because they’d
both seen the blueprints and partially assembled Mormon war machine,
Talos, and their impending expose could make greater waves than John C.
Wreck-it Bennetts did because Jo was on the national stage running for
president. All of these people spelled disaster beyond simply Jo
suspecting them of conspiracy to murder him. What would be worse for Jo
than loss of his life? Loss of his status and legacy. Each of these men
had enough knives to effectively murder their Caesar in his own capital,
but not just physically. At the end of the day, Jo cared about his
bodily well-being but he cared much more about his name and image. The
greatest fear a fraud carries to their pillow every night is the specter
of public scrutiny. If the world found out how much of a fraud he was,
his tyrannical empire would crumble in a second.

The only way to combat these men was character assassination. They were
too high-profile for literal assassination as their disappearances as
critics of the prophet would raise too many questions. So, Jo, White-out
Willard Richards, and Double-dub Phelps set out to murder their image
and credibility in the Nauvoo press. If they could be branded as enemies
of the church before their coming expose, maybe it would eventually blow
over like the Bennett expose had done.

However, the Nauvoo Neighbor didn’t just include overt character
assassinations of these men, it also included little queues for those
eagle-eyed readers who’d sworn their oaths to protect the prophet and
each other even at the loss of their own life.

A strange little couplet appeared in the first May issue of the Nauvoo
Neighbor with some choice words capitalized, one of which was
misspelled.

> NEW CONUNDRUM
> 
> Truth shines; the just advance,
> 
> Or why do saints maintain their righteous cause?
> 
> ANSWER
> 
> Because the Lord by CHAUNCE’s.
> 
> Will never, never, FOSTER *unwise* LAWS\!

Not “chance,” but “CHAUNCE”. Also, FOSTER and LAWS are all capitalized.
This was the new conundrum the Danites were tasked with answering. These
are three targets in the local Nauvoo press and only those who knew the
signals could read the true message.

The heat was turning up with the Fosters, Higbees, and Laws. This public
display of power will continue to evolve and mutate in the coming weeks
of the podcast.

Now, to illustrate a point that I stated earlier, do you, the listener,
even remember that we started this episode with talking about the King
Follett Discourse? Maybe you do, but I’d be willing to be that you got
caught up in everything else that was going on around the time it was
given and that detail just kind of slipped your mind. That’s the point
I’m trying to illustrate; with everything else going on, the King
Follett Discourse wasn’t at the front of people’s minds\! The Nauvoo
kingdom was plagued by outrage, scandal, dissent and speeches about
assassination attempts to kill the prophet. It was a city ruled by chaos
to the point that the Mormons didn’t know if they would have a home for
another year. Look, their resettlement to Nauvoo from Missouri was
haphazard and desperate at best. They had no reason to believe this city
was their permanent home and there were politicians running on campaigns
of revoking the Nauvoo Charter. That would, in a legal sense, literally
remove their legal right to be a city. The city government was so
corrupt it required a cleansing fire. The outspoken citizens like the
Fosters, Higbees, Laws, Joseph H. Jackson, and a select few others,
merely bore the brunt of the corruption, but that corruption infected
the every-day lives of every person living in the city. People may
resign their mental faculties to herd mentality just to get by without
cognitive dissonance, but the lack of infrastructure, the overt
favoritism of the Mormon aristocracy, the constant theft going
unpunished, the inability for citizens to leave their homes at night,
the officers from other militias or states barging into town and
demanding the arrest of Joseph Smith from time to time, all the rumors
of polygamy and all the deception and secrecy required to practice it
while keeping the general membership insulated from it; all of these
issues are just the tip of the iceberg revealing seriously troubling
issues in Nauvoo.

That herd mentality may keep people paying their tithing and going to
every public meeting, but at the end of the day each and every one of
those 15,000 people had to deal with the fact that life sucked and they
needed a reason to explain why. Why is life so hard? Why is all of this
happening? Why can’t I find a stable job to feed my family? Why does
Heber Kimball only visit me when my husband is away? Why do mommy and
daddy fight so much? Why doesn’t my best friend talk to me anymore when
we were best friends only a few weeks ago? The only explanation they
could find was the explanation given to them every Sunday, in every
speech by every leader in the church they looked up to. We’re being
persecuted because this is the one true church and the world is a fallen
empire of sin. We need to build the kingdom of God to overcome the
worldly Kingdom of the Adversary.

For the majority of these people, they were in mental survival mode;
their rational faculties had been traumatized out of them for years and
the only solace they had was what they knew, the church. That’s how you
create a body of unwavering sycophants with undying fealty to their
prophet priest and king of Zion, the New Jerusalem. Jo had abused these
people to the point that they couldn’t possibly consider their
circumstances through a rational lens and he had their loyalty because
he taught them everything they needed to think instead of how to think.

When humans are in survival mode like the Mormons at this time, the
animal side wakes up and the rational parts grow quieter. Food, shelter,
a leader, and an enemy, that’s what homo sapien needs to survive; all
the thinking is done all that’s left is action and obedience. This
behavior rest fundamentally at the core of religious belief and Jo had
fostered all the constituent pieces to the mind-control recipe. These
are foundations of every religion. Belief and lower-level primitive
thinking. No questions, no doubts, no searching for answers, just black
and white hivemindedness with a common enemy to hate. Jo could see these
strings and he knew which ones to pull. Then, when he opens up with a
sermon about expansive and thought-provoking theological evolution, only
few noticed. He hadn’t formed a community of theologians, he had
conditioned a commune of soldiers, and therein lies the real danger of
his power.

Too often, people don’t want to search for answers, they want answers.
People want the reward at the end of the journey, not to experience the
journey itself. A person may want these higher endeavors but a person
quickly surrenders those pursuits when their people face existential
threats. Why don’t we see more mentions of the King Follett Discourse in
contemporary journal entries or letter correspondences? Because these
people were to preoccupied with survival and too worn out by the
constant onslaught of outrage to care.

To think that institutionalized trauma and mind-control mechanisms
devised here haven’t survived in Mormon culture today would be a
disturbing error and ignoring the real history of what makes Mormons,
Mormons. The protectionism, the defaulting to figures of undue
authority, the paper-thin pseudo-intellectualism that burns to ash at
the slightest ray of critical thought, these variables evolved millions
of years ago and were harnessed and tuned perfectly to create what we
see today. Without something better, people locked into this cycle may
never escape.

That’s going to do it for our main segment today.

We’ve officially updated our next goal on patreon.com/nakedmormonism. If
you enjoy this show, if you take value from listening to it, hey,
consider throwing us a buck a show. If you do, you gain access to
extended editions of every new episode, an extra episode every week
including the NaMo Book Club reading through old Mormon history books
with commentary, and more importantly, you’re supporting a research
endeavor to get the fascinating world of Mormon history in a digestible
format to the world.

A little anecdote for you. At last year’s Sunstone Symposium, I met Dan
Vogel in person for the first time. Dan Vogel, of course, is one of the
most prolific and respected scholars of Joseph Smith history alive. I
had recently done the Mormon Stories podcast episode about the Spalding
theory and few historians are more critical of the theory than Dan
Vogel. I asked him what he thought about it and he said he was hoping
for or expecting something new or groundbreaking in my presentation but
thought it was overall fair. This struck me because it illustrates what
my job really is. Of the tens of thousands of Mormon Stories listeners,
I’m certain very few knew all the information I presented there before
hearing it from me. The feedback from that episode shows to me that VERY
few people are conversant and knowledgeable about the history discussed
in the community of Mormon history. So, while Dan Vogel and Cheryl
Bruno, another of my Mormon historian friends, were hoping I’d drop a
new bomb on them about Spalding, they were both disappointed because I
didn’t present anything new… to them. But, for the VAST majority of
people listening to that episode, almost all of it was new to them.
Mormon history academia is a fast-paced field of research and my job is
to take that information and communicate it to people like you who
aren’t familiar with the sources, authors, publications, books, and
documents that the niche Mormon history community is. Yes, Dan Vogel is
a big fish, but he swimming in a little pond. I’m trying to dig out the
shores of the pond and expand it while filling it with more little fish
and water. My job is Mormon history communication and the fact of the
matter is I need those historians as much as they need me to get more
people interested in this fascinating aspect of American history. This
is my job, this is my passion, and those who support the show make that
passionate dream a reality.

If we hit our next goal on patreon.com/nakedmormonism, I’ll be booting
up a Mormon history Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I’m incredibly
excited to weave together a universe of 19<sup>th</sup>-century American
history that blends magic and reality to tell a side of Mormon history
only fiction can reveal. If that interests you, help me get to the next
goal on patreon.com/nakedmormonism. With a few recent pledge that were
very generous, we only need a hundred fifty new listeners to sign up and
each and every one of them will be getting a ton of bonus content and
will help the mission of the show to make Mormon history accessible and
fun. If you’re somebody who a combo meal or a couple coffees a month
will make a difference for you, or you’re on a fixed income or a
student, don’t worry about it you can help in other ways. But, if you’re
somebody that a couple gallons of gas or raiding the impulse rack next
to the check-out counter won’t be felt at the end of the month, consider
sending that loose change our way.

Our newest pledge comes from Dee and we have three new pledge increases
by Ace, Christi-Ann, and Jeff Anderson, who recently gave me permission
to use his full name on the show. So, to our new pledges and our pledge
increases, thank you so much for giving money to the show and funding
the time required to research, script, edit, produce, and market 8-10
podcast episodes every month. You 4 and ALL of our amazing patrons have
given me my life and I couldn’t be more grateful. So, thank you.

If you can’t support the show with your hard-earned money, spreading the
word is also a huge help. Telling a friend, tagging me or the show in a
social media thread, or just liking us, all go a long way to get the
word out.
