Ep 198 – Higbee Dissent

On this episode, the Fosters, the Higbees, and the Laws in May of 1844
continue at the forefront of our examination. This week we focus in on
the Higbee brothers, Chauncey and Francis (Frank). The Higbee families
joined the church in 1832 during the Kirtland era before moving to
Jackson County, Missouri to join the Mormon settlement there. They were
forcefully removed from the county with the rest of the Mormons in late
1833 through early 1834. Francis helps with the Kirtland Temple
construction then returns to Missouri to rejoin the rest of the Higbee
families. When Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and the Quorum of Apostles
are removed from the Kirtland leadership, Francis and Chauncey join
their families in defending the Mormon settlements during the 1838
Missouri-Mormon conflict. Francis Higbee even joins the Danites
(Joseph’s underground enforcement squad). Francis and two of his
uncles are arraigned in the November Court of Inquiry when the Mormon
settlements surrendered. The Higbees were released and helped the
Mormons resettle in Illinois after the Extermination Order by Governor
Lilburn Boggs. Francis and Chauncey both team up with John C. Bennett
during his public defection and expose publishing efforts. Both Francis
and Chauncey would remain on the blacklist of dissenters from that time
forward. Both deal with public character assassination by the prophet
and his cronies. Both deal with the fallout of polygamy and the
clandestine leadership keeping it under wraps. Both join hands with the
Fosters and Laws in May of 1844.

The Fosters, the Higbees, and the Laws in May of 1844. Do you know why
we’re talking about them? Last week we discussed the Fosters, how
Charles and Robert had become affiliated with the church, their
leadership positions, and how Robert came into increasing degrees of
conflict with the prophet in very public fora both at the pulpit and in
the Nauvoo Court room.

Today we’re going to tackle the Higbee brothers, Francis and Chauncey.

There were many Higbees associated with Mormonism from the Kirtland era
of the church. The whole family of parents Elias and Sarah, and children
Francis Marion, Chauncey Lawson, Andrew Jackson, and Dewitt Clinton
joined the church in 1832. Francis was twelve years old, Chauncey 11.
Notably, these weren’t the only Higbees to convert to the church in 1832
as Elias’s brothers, Isaac, and John, and sisters Mary Higbee and Mary
Denham all joined the church around that time as well. The Higbee family
was large and brought many people into the church when it was in its
infant stages in early Kirtland.

The Higbees also enjoyed varying degrees of church leadership. But,
since we’re only focusing on Francis and Chauncey let’s really dig into
these guys. Francis and Chauncey in 1832 were still young enough to be
toted around by their parents, Elias and Sarah. Elias and Sarah took
their sons to Jackson County, Missouri in 1833, as tensions between the
Missourians and Mormons began to boil. They arrived very soon before the
Missourians kicked the Mormons out of Jackson county and the entire
Mormon population was forced into Clay and surrounding counties.

It wasn’t just Elias and Sarah who took their kids with them to Jackson
County. The Mormon population out there was growing very quickly and
land was cheap… or free, sort of. All the Higbee families moved to
Missouri in 1833, only to be kicked out of Jackson County soon after
arrival. They were all forced into Clay and surrounding counties because
of the troubles with the Missourians.

At the age of fifteen, one of our Higbee brothers up for discussion,
Francis, struck out on his own and moved back to Kirtland for a brief
period. What actually brought him back to Geauga County, Ohio after his
family had moved to Missouri is a source of mystery but informed
speculation would postulate that he was old enough to work on the
Kirtland Temple when it was in its final stages of construction and all
able-bodied young men were petitioned by the leadership to chip in
resources or labor. Francis’s younger brother, Chauncey, seems to have
remained in Missouri with the rest of the family during this period.

After the construction of the Kirtland temple and the dedication
ceremony in early 1836, Francis at age sixteen returned to Missouri to
remain with his family. The age division between Chauncey and Francis
continued to divide their activities in Missouri. Francis being only a
year older granted him access to plenty of activities required by the
Mormon leadership. While Chauncey was most-likely helping his family
with menial hired labor, the older Francis took on responsibility in the
Mormon empire building process. When Jo was removed from church
leadership in Kirtland and fled to the Missouri Mormon settlements,
Francis joined the cause of the one true prophet.

While an actual role of the Danites doesn’t exist, historians bicker
about who were and weren’t members of the Danites. D. Michael Quinn
claims that basically all members of the Mormon militia during 1838,
known as the Army of Israel, were Danites, members of the underground
shadow enforcement squad. Other historians disagree with Quinn by
asserting that membership in the Danites was a higher-ranking circle of
the Army of Israel and only select members of the Army were also in the
Danites. While there isn’t really a solid bedrock to stand on with this
issue, the point remains that the Mormons formed their own militias
without government approval, leading to the charges of high treason
after the Mormon settlements surrendered in the first part of November
1838.

Francis Higbee was a member of one or both of these organizations. I
would postulate he was likely a Danite and my evidence for that is as
follows. The Danite Manifesto was signed in June of 1838, giving Oliver
Cowdery, David and John Whitmer, and W.W. Phelps three days to leave
Caldwell County. The manifesto bears the signatures of 83 men. Two of
those men are Francis’s uncles, Isaac and John S. Higbee. Further,
during the same testimony from Dr. Sampson Avard, the defector whose
testimony led to the Mormon Extermination order and the arrest of Jo and
his cronies, Avard referred to the Mormon depredations of non-Mormon
settlements in Daviess County. In this statement he directly named the
participants of the pillaging and burning posses.

> The following of the defendants were in the last expedition to Daviess
> county: Joseph Smith, jr., Hiram Smith, P.P. Pratt, Lyman Wight,…
> Alexander McRay, John S. Higbey, Edward Partridge, \[and\] Francis
> Higbey.

Francis Higbee was named alongside his uncle in an explicitly Danite
robbing campaign. Apparently, being 18, Francis Higbee was old enough to
participate as a militant Mormon during this conflict. He was among the
dozens of Mormons arrested and tried during the November Court of
Inquiry, largely due to Sampson Avard and Thomas B. Marsh naming him
directly in connection with the extra-military activities of the Mormon
leadership. During this Missouri-Mormon war of 1838, Chauncey Higbee was
only 16 to 17 years old, likely making him ineligible to participate at
anything more than maybe a message courier.

Of the 53 men charged for the initial crimes of “high treason against
the State, murder, burglary, arson, robbery, and larceny,” only the six
in Liberty Jail and about a dozen others remained imprisoned for the
months following the war concomitant with the Mormon expulsion from
Missouri to Illinois. Francis Higbee and the other two Higbees arraigned
in the Court of Inquiry for this investigative trial were all released
by the end of November to return to their families and assist the Quorum
of Apostles during the exodus. By spring of 1839 all the Higbees,
Chauncey and Francis included, were located in Illinois, first in the
initial landing spot in Adams County, a little town called Quincy, and
then to Hancock County in what was known as Commerce but would soon be
called Nauvoo.

Once John C. Wreck-it-Bennett joined the refugee settlement of Nauvoo
and helped pass the Nauvoo Charter through the Illinois Legislature,
both Chauncey and Francis Higbee were appointed aides-de-camp of Major
General John C. Bennett during the formation of the Nauvoo Legion. Now,
an aide-de-camp is essentially a special position as a direct assistant
to a high-ranking officer. Aides-de-camp are rarely expected to
participate in military conflict; their role is more in counseling and
grunt work of running messages or handling confidential paperwork.

Understandably, as both Higbee brothers were aides-de-camp to John C.
Wreck-it Bennett, that meant they were of relatively high rank in the
Nauvoo Legion, or at least favored by the highest-ranking officers of
Bennett and Jo. Life was good for Francis and Chauncey Higbee during
this time. They were gainfully employed, making ends meet, likely found
nice women to court during social occasions, during which they could
elect to attend in their Nauvoo Legion uniforms for extra attention or
if they were on personal bodyguard duty.

Both Higbee brothers, in addition to their father and uncles, enjoyed
leadership and board member roles in Nauvoo. Elias Higbee was on the
board of trustees of the University of Nauvoo as well as on the board of
regents and helped determine the curriculum. Isaac and Elias Higbee were
also on the board of the Nauvoo Agricultural and Manufacturing
Association. All of the Higbee men were plugged into Nauvoo Government
at different levels in addition to being conscripted into the Nauvoo
Legion. A brief point of clarification, Isaac Higbee Sr. and Elias
Higbee were the Higbee brothers who converted with their entire families
to the church in the early 1830s. Isaac had a child named after him.
Isaac Sr died during the Mormon expulsion from Missouri in early 1839.
All the Isaac Higbees we see in Nauvoo relate to Isaac Jr., who was
cousin of Francis and Chauncey were talking about today. Francis and
Chauncey’s uncle Isaac Sr. had died in 1839, but their father, Elias is
still present in Nauvoo documents until 1843, which we’ll discuss
momentarily.

But all good things must come to an end lest the taste turn to ash in
one’s mouth and the friendship between Wreck-it Bennett and
lieutenant-General grandmaster king of Israel Joseph Smith soured.
Bennett became aware of the assassination attempt by Pistol Packin
Porter Rockwell of former Missouri Governor and Senatorial candidate
Lilburn Boggs and Bennett decided that was the breaking point.

When Bennett broke away from the church, he drove a wedge in the Mormon
community between the Jo loyalists and the believers who believed
Bennett’s allegations and weren’t pleased with the direction of the
church and its leadership. The Higbees were caught up on the opposition
side, making them enemies to Joseph Smith. Francis Higbee is named
multiple times in Bennett’s expose letters and the full book-length
History of the Saints. Patreon.com/nakedmormonism.

Francis Higbee sided with Bennett during his public departure. This is
understandable because he and Chauncey were both aides-de-camp to
Bennett; basically, his personal assistants. They were friends with
Wreck-it Bennett and thus became swept up in the character assassination
campaign waged by Jo and his loyalists.

When Bennett was first excommunicated from the church and removed as
Mayor of Nauvoo, Francis M. Higbee sent him a letter dated July 6, 1842
giving Bennett a description of Jo’s public melting down over Bennett’s
impending expose. What is notable in this letter and another we’ll read
from Chauncey right after, is the fact that the Higbee brothers had
essentially become Bennett’s emissaries during his data collecting for
the expose. Bennett couldn’t spend much time in Nauvoo without being
followed so he needed to work with people still there who weren’t Jo
loyalists. The Higbees worked with Bennett in collecting affidavits,
talking to people whom they wanted to give statements to the facts, and
generally running errands for Bennett. Others who weren’t in the Jo
loyalist camp soon became caught up in the smear campaign, including
George W. Robinson and Hingepin Sidney Rigdon.

Chauncey L. Higbee also shared some correspondence with Wreck-it Bennett
in a letter dated just 3 days before his brother’s previous letter we
just read.

The Higbees defecting from the loyalist camp spelled disaster for Jo and
his closest trusted elites. The Higbees had seen and participated in
some of the most well-hidden meetings of the Mormon empire. Before the
Bennett meltdown and his resulting expose, many Higbees were in line to
be inducted into the anointed quorum. However, with Chauncey and Francis
Higbee siding with Bennett, they would from that time forward be on the
outs. Bennett continued to call upon both Higbee brothers as sources of
criminal conduct by the prophet. Later in his same expose he prints a
number of Nauvoo financial records dealing with Jo’s application for
bankruptcy. Jo had to hide assets in order to qualify for bankruptcy
status which had only recently gone into effect for the state of
Illinois. In order to hide those assets, Jo transferred a number of them
to Emma and his children for as little as $1 per lot or deed. As a
precursor to the section in this chapter of Bennett’s book he writes
this:

> The Bankrupt law, section 2, provides that no conveyances of property
> shall be made in contemplation of bankruptcy,…

Then Bennett prints some of the correspondence and relevant documents to
show Jo had violated the statutes of the bankruptcy laws. After that he
states:

> If an official certificate is required, call upon Chauncey Robinson,
> Esq., the Recorder of Hancock, and he will certify that these are
> correct extracts form the county records. There are various other
> matters of record that could be made to operate against this king of
> swindlers and imposters, Joe Smith; but I presume that the foregoing
> will be sufficient to give him a comfortable home in the State
> Penitentiary, at Alton, for some years to come, if Missouri does not
> get him first.
> 
> If oral testimony is required, call upon General George W. Robinson,
> Colonel Francis M. Higbee, and others, who are acquainted with the
> transactions.

Both Francis and Chauncey Higbee were crucial to Wreck-it Bennett’s
information collection for his 1842 expose letters and full-length book.
It was through them that Bennett was capable of acquiring one of the
most consequential letters in all of Nauvoo Mormon history, known as the
Happiness Letter.

One point which drove Jo and Hingepin Rigdon apart was Jo’s lust for
Rigdon’s second daughter, Nancy. We discussed her and the Happiness
Letter back on episode 117. Essentially, Jo approached her in order to
teach her about the doctrine of polygamy. To put it simply, she rejected
his advances and he sent her a letter, which White-out Willard Richards
delivered. The letter gets its name from the first words of “Happiness
is the object and design of our existence, and will be the end thereof,
if we pursue the path that leads to it…” After that the letter goes on
to say “Our Heavenly Father is more *liberal* in his views, and
*boundless* in his mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe
or receive,” adding “Every thing that God gives us is *lawful and
right*, and it is proper that we should ENJOY *his gifts and
blessings*.” This is all written in the context of trying to convince
Nancy Rigdon to accept Jo’s polygamy proposal.

What is extremely notable about this proposal was the extent to which
Francis Higbee was knowledgeable and involved in the Nancy Rigdon
proposal situation, according to Bennett anyway so take that with a
grain of salt. According to Bennett, when Jo’s messenger, White-out
Willard Richards, first approached Nancy and told her to meet with the
prophet, Jo wasn’t able to make the meeting. Sensing that something was
amiss, Bennett went to a friend he could trust, Francis Higbee, whom
Bennett instructed to immediately go to Nancy and tell her what Jo had
in store.

> Dr. Willard Richards, however, one of the holy twelve Mormon Apostles,
> and Spiritual High Priest, and Pander-General for Lust; whom I had
> long suspected as being up to his eyes in the business with Joe, came
> in, and said, “Miss Nancy, Joseph cannot be in to-day; please call
> again on Thursday.” This she agreed to do; but she communicated the
> matter to Colonel Francis M. Higbee, who was addressing her, and asked
> his advice as to the second visit. I then came to a knowledge of the
> facts, and went immediately to Joe, and said to him, “Joseph, you are
> a master Mason, and Nancy is a Master Mason’s daughter, \[so is Mrs.
> Pratt, the daughter of Mr. Bates;\] so stay your hand, or you will get
> into trouble—*remember your obligation*.” Joe replied, “You are my
> enemy, and wish to oppose me.” I then went to Colonel \[Francis M.\]
> Higbee, and told him Joe’s designs, and requested him to go
> immediately and see Miss Rigdon, and tell her the infernal plot—that
> Joe would approach her in the name of the Lord, by special revelation,
> \&c., and to put her on her guard, but advise her to go and see for
> herself what Joe would do. He did so, and she went down.

Because Francis Higbee had warned Nancy, she was prepared for Jo when he
subsequently locked her in the room and tried to force himself on her.
She told him she’d cry out for help and he relented. Nancy was one of
the lucky ones when it came to Jo’s advances. After this refusal is when
Jo sent her the Happiness Letter which instructed her to burn after
reading. We have very few pieces of paper in Jo’s actual handwriting and
his frequent burn after reading instructions are partially to blame.
Needless to say, according to Wreck-it Bennett, if not for Francis
Higbee, we may not have the text of the Happiness Letter today.

> The original, of which the above is a literal copy, in the
> hand-writing of Dr. Richards, is now in my possession. It was handed
> me by Colonel F\[rancis\]. M. Higbee, in the presence of General
> George W. Robinson.

Also in the presence of George W. Robinson, Francis Higbee told Wreck-it
Bennett about Jo’s plot to assassinate Bennett. When Bennett first began
to reveal his grand designs, according to Bennett, Jo brought him into
the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge and this was the scene as reported by Bennett.

> We entered, and *he locked the door, put the key in his pocket,* DREW
> A PISTOL ON ME, and said, ‘The peace of my family requires that you
> should sign an affidavit and make a statement before the next City
> Council,… exonerating me from all participation whatever,… in word or

> females in general*; and if you do not do it *with apparent

> to the Danites for execution to-night; *for my dignity and purity must
> and shall be maintained before the public,* EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF
> LIFE… *Your die is cast\!* YOUR FATE IS FIXED\!\! YOUR DOOM IS
> SEALED\!\!\! If you refuse… He then unlocked the door; we went into

> told me, in the presence of General George W. Robinson, that HE WAS IN
> POSSESSION OF A SECRET THAT WOULD OPEN THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE, and
> that, *if it came to the worst,* he would file his affidavit; but he
> would not *then* tell me what that *secret* was. General Robinson,
> however, informed me afterwards that *it was a knowledge of Joe’s
> threats of murder and the duress.*

Indeed, Francis M. Higbee made an affidavit before Alderman Hiram
Kimball, not Heber the Creeper Kimball, Hiram Kimball, definitely
different guys in every conceivable way. In that affidavit, Francis
Higbee stated:

> That Joseph Smith told him that *John C. Bennett could be easily put
> aside,* OR DROWNED, *and no person would be the wiser for it,* AND
> THAT IT OUGHT TO BE ATTENDED TO; and he further remarked that THE
> SOONER THIS WAS DONE THE BETTER FOR THE CHURCH, *fearing, as he said,
> that Bennett would make some disclosures prejudicial to said Smith*.

Without these affidavits, Governor Carlin, the outgoing Governor of
Illinois preceding Governor Thomas Ford, wouldn’t have had the necessary
affidavits to sign an arrest warrant for Joseph Smith which forced him
and Pistol Packin Porter into hiding for the last 6 months of 1842.

It wasn’t just Francis Higbee caught up in this scandal helping Wreck-it
Bennett; Chauncey Higbee also cast in his lot with the dissenting voices
at this time. He sent a letter to Bennett, which Bennett printed in his
expose, which provides some interesting context and alludes to specific
tasks Bennett had tasked Chauncey Higbee to carry out while Bennett was
away from Nauvoo for his own safety. This letter was written on August
14<sup>th</sup> 1842, when Porter had fled the city of Nauvoo for
Indiana escaping the law and Jo was hiding in places around and in
Nauvoo. Port and Jo were both wanted by Governors Reynolds of Missouri
and Carlin of Illinois for attempting to assassinate Lilburn Boggs.

> I cannot believe, for a moment, that you have forgotten a person who
> has stood by you as I have done, both in prosperity and exile; for I
> assure you, Doctor, that I shall never forsake or forget you, nor the
> scenes through which we have passed together. There is quite a *rip
> up* in our city this week. A demand has been made by Governor
> Reynolds, of Missouri, on the affidavit of Ex-Governor Boggs, for O.
> P. Rockwell and Joseph Smith; on which demand Governor Carlin, last
> Saturday, issued his writ.

Then Chauncey goes through the arrest of Porter and Jo by Marshals
Pitman and King, the filing for writ of Habeas Corpus, the marshals
refusing to honor the writ and appealing to the Circuit Court at
Carthage. At that point, Jo and Port were released by “making some
masonic pledges to the officers to deliver himself and Rockwell up at
any time when called for.” That didn’t work because they went into
hiding immediately after being released by the marshals so those guys
could get an arrest warrant to override the Nauvoo writ of habeas
corpus. Chauncey, among everybody else, suspected they were hiding in
town somewhere, even though Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith had stated from
the pulpit that they were headed to England. Chauncey Higbee also adds
the interesting detail that “The Prophet prophesied n the stand, about
four weeks since, that ‘Bennett never would have influence enough to get
a demand made for him;’ but, alas\! he has, at this late hour, realized
his mistake.”

Chauncey Higbee wraps up the letter by capturing the general feeling
around Nauvoo about the Bennett and Jo Smith war going on, asking
Bennett to return to Nauvoo.

> Your friends here are firm, and desire to see you very much. Your
> presence is now required in the west, and I advise you to come
> immediately on. Your presence would give fresh courage to your
> friends, and a zest to the whole proceedings that could not be
> otherwise inspired. ‘Napoleon should be in the field.’
> 
> I have scrupulously attended to the business, which you confided to my
> care. All the friends desire to be respectfully remembered to you.
> 
> Your friend, CHAUNCEY L. HIGBEE

The Bennett meltdown was a storm Jo couldn’t keep contained. He was
forced into hiding while his enemies continued to roam the streets of
Nauvoo without much fear. Bennett was the head of the snake but his
being cut off from the church and Nauvoo society revealed the dissent
problem in Nauvoo was more hydra than snake. Bennett made a lot friends,
and by virtue Jo a lot of enemies, when he left and published his
expose. Those folks who helped him could never be fully trusted again by
the remaining leadership.

While Jo was in hiding, his quorum of apostles and closest counselors
engaged in damage control. The media outside of Nauvoo caught hold of
the story and Bennett’s articles in the Sangamo Journal were republished
across the nation. A contemporary commentator and sober critic of the
Nauvoo church, ThomAss Coke Sharp of the Warsaw Signal, received
corroboration of Bennett’s allegations from Francis Higbee and others,
printing this article in the August 6<sup>th</sup> 1842 edition of the
Signal.

> The testimony of General Bennett, then, has force and effect, when
> taken in connection with that of Dr. Avard, W.W. Phelps, and others,
> as given before the Court of Inquiry in Missouri, and the direct
> corroborations of Colonel \[Francis\] Higbee and Miss Martha H.
> Brotherton. All go to show the point arrived at, viz., that Joe Smith
> is a most consummate *villain and knave.*

The Higbees, unlike Bennett, chose to remain in Nauvoo. This is the
point in Nauvoo history where Francis and Chauncey Higbee’s trajectories
depart, only to arrive at the same location by May of 1844. Francis
remained in good standing in the church and as a colonel in the Nauvoo
Legion. Chauncey, however, became a public target of Joseph Smith’s
character assassination campaign. Jo was chaos spiraling out of control
during the second half of 1842 and Chauncey suffered the collateral
damage.

Francis moved to a town called Pleasant Hill in Pike County, Illinois,
probably in an effort to get away from the Danites as he was an enemy of
the church. Chauncey remained in Nauvoo, but was excommunicated from the
church. The details of Chauncey Higbee’s excommunication are absolutely
fascinating.

Shortly after Wreck-it Bennett’s excommunication and removal as Mayor,
yet before Chauncey Higbee and Bennett shared letter correspondence as
reported in Bennett’s History of the Saints, Chauncey Higbee was charged
by the Nauvoo High Council, the ecclesiastical body, for unchristianlike
conduct with women. Of course, as was the case with every case brought
by Jo and his cronies, witnesses were produced which paint a picture of
Chauncey Higbee as a horrible kind of character.

> MARGARET J. NYMAN

A similar affidavit was made by Margaret’s sister, Matilda stating
additionally “I yielded and become subject to the will of my seducer,
Chauncey L. Higbee: and having since found out to my satisfaction, that
a number of wicked men have conspired to use the name of Joseph Smith,
or the heads of the Church, falsely and wickedly to enable them to
gratify their lusts, thereby destroying female innocence and virtue, I
repent before *God* and my brethren and ask forgiveness.” Matilda also
testified “that I never had any personal acquaintance with Joseph Smith
and never heard him teach such doctrines as Higbee stated either
directly or indirectly.” There’s another testimony from Sarah Miller and
yet another from Catherine Warren and all of them told essentially the
same story that Higbee told them there was no sin in sexual intercourse
if the women keep it to themselves and that he had the prophet’s
approval and that none of them have personally known Joseph Smith. The
remarkable consistency in the statements, even down to the terms each
woman used, is highly suspicious when we consider the timing of the
hearing. Bennett is repeatedly named as the originator of the idea and
Jo’s name is completely exonerated in every statement. It almost reads
as if all of the witnesses were instructed as to what to say on the
stand before they testified.

The splash damage from these testimonies hits Jo too. Let’s not mince
words here. Jo was pulling the strings to paint Wreck-it Bennett in a
bad light at the end of May 1842 when this hearing took place. The fact
that Chauncey Higbee was excommunicated from the church as a result of
this hearing sheds a brighter light on the damage control Jo and his
cronies were utilizing to keep Bennett’s salacious accusations from
landing. However, whatever Bennett was up to was the exact thing Jo was
up do until Bennett decided to defect. It’s no coincidence that the term
New and Everlasting Covenant doesn’t make its colloquial appearance
referring to polygamy until Bennett defected. That was how the
leadership was able to distinguish its practices from the “spiritual
wifery” Bennett and apparently Higbee and others were practicing. The
practice was the same, just called by different names. Chauncey was
caught up in the meltdown and got burned along with George W. Robinson,
Sarah Pratt, and a dozen other previously high-ranking members.

One interesting detail to tease out of the testimony from Sarah Miller
is her implying that Bennett would perform abortions to hide the results
of polygamy.

> Chauncey Higbee said it would never be known, I told him it might be
> told in bringing forth (a euphemism for pregnancy). Chauncey said
> there was no danger, and that Dr. Bennet understood it, and would come
> and take it away, if there was any thing.

Sometimes a trial is more important for the witness statements than the
actual outcome. Notably, this was a high council tribunal, a
disciplinary council if you will. This was not held in the capacity of
the Nauvoo Municipal Court for illegal conduct as that may require other
witnesses to come forward and testify on behalf of Chauncey Higbee.
Instead, because it was a church court, only the prosecution was able to
call witnesses and Chauncey was excommunicated as a result.

Coming out of this entire affair was a Nauvoo Municipal court
proceeding. The church court had excommunicated Chauncey Higbee and
Francis Higbee remained unreprimanded. However, at the civil level, Jo
decided to exert some force upon both Higbee brothers for slander and
defamation. Because Jo was king of Nauvoo, he prevailed and both
Chauncey and Francis were fined $100 each. A super interesting detail to
come out of this lawsuit judgement was a recognizance filed by clerk
Ebenezer Robinson. According to the filing, as long as Chauncey appeared
at the church tribunal, he wouldn’t be held in contempt and wouldn’t be
responsible for paying the fine. I’ve never seen this before but I’m
sure it wasn’t uncommon in Nauvoo. Essentially, Jo sued Chauncey for
slander and defamation which resulted in a fine of $100, but if Chauncey
didn’t leave town and showed up for his tribunal in the High Council to
be excommunicated then he wouldn’t have to pay the fine. It’s like bail
but the bond the person pays is going to a church disciplinary council.
Eventually Jo dropped the suit, probably because he was in hiding for 6
months after he filed it and couldn’t attend any trials without risk of
arrest by Illinois constables who’d extradite him to Missouri.

The remainder of 1842 and the majority of 1843 the Higbees sort of
remained at the surface level of the church. Chauncey was excommunicated
and therefore barred from anything of consequence during that period.
Francis, however, somehow made it through the Bennett meltdown in good
standing. Francis didn’t become the target of the character
assassination campaign waged against Bennett and his cronies even though
Francis had very clearly been corresponding with Bennett even more so
than his brother Chauncey did. While Francis had been aide-de-camp to
John C. Bennett, Bennett’s removal from the Nauvoo Legion left Francis
without a job in the Legion. As a result he was named aide-de-camp to
another major-general of the Legion. The Joseph Smith Papers doesn’t
list who that specific major general was, but I suppose it would likely
be William Law or another of similar high rank who were still largely
loyal to Jo in 1842.

The entire Bennett affair had left the taste of ash in the mouths of
both Higbee brothers. Their father, Elias Higbee, was called to be
church historian and recorder prior to the Bennett meltdown and it seems
as if Elias had some hand in calming the contentious spirits of his
sons. After he’d moved a hundred miles south of Nauvoo in late 1842,
Francis Higbee wrote to his father Elias: “I want to understand that I
have no feelings against Joseph; I have fully satisfied myself that he
has been called of God, to do a great, and mighty, work in the earth,
and let it suffice to say I am fully satisfied with him. All our former
difficulties, were forever effectually settled before I left.” Chauncey
Higbee wrote to his father a month after this: “My object, is not to
vindicate or anathamatise either party,--free from the shackles of party
litigation I desire peacefully to pursue the duties of my daily
avocation; while—thankful for the boon—I hope long to remain a citizen
of our flourishing city.”

Both Francis and Chauncey had built their reputations and community in
the Nauvoo kingdom and the general threat by being dissenters of the
church, combined with some likely gentle pushes from their father,
resulted in both Chauncey and Francis taking a more distant approach to
church affairs. Chauncey Higbee remained excommunicated, but Francis
remained in active duty to the church, albeit with the cloud of distrust
hanging over him. Anybody who’d worked with Bennett during 1842 was
perceived as an enemy regardless of whether or not they had been
officially disciplined by the High Council. Both Francis and Chauncey
bore that scarlet letter. The peace brokered between these brothers and
church leadership wasn’t long for this world.

Elias Higbee, Chauncey and Francis’s father, passed away suddenly in
June 1843 at the age of 47. Jo’s journal for that day reads as follows:

> This morning, about daybreak, Elder Elias Higbee died at his residence
> near the Temple \[of\] Cholera morbus, inflammation, and
> mortification. \[He was\] one of the Temple committee.

The funeral service for Elias Higbee wasn’t held immediately. A few days
after this entry, Jo traveled to Dixon, Illinois to visit one of Emma’s
siblings living there and preach along the way. While Jo was in Dixon,
Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson arrested him with writs of extradition from
Governor Ford of Illinois and Governor Reynolds of Missouri. Jo sent his
personal secretary, William Clayton or Quilliam Claypen as we call him,
to get to Nauvoo as soon as possible and alert Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff
Smith that Jo had been arrested and was on his way to Missouri in
custody. Hyrum called out the Danites masquerading as the Nauvoo Legion
to rescue the prophet and the sheriffs were arrested by Jo’s boys. It
wasn’t until late 1843 that this whole matter was resolved. During that
interim period, the funeral service for Elias Higbee was held on August
13 and Jo’s sermon contains some cryptic signals.

> the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;… I am not like
> other men; my mind is continually occupied with the business of the
> day, and I have to depend entirely upon the living God for every thing
> I say on such occasions as these.

> 
> Where has Judge Higbee gone?
> 
> Who is there that would not give all his goods to feed the poor, and
> pour out his gold and silver to the four winds to go where Judge
> Higbee has gone?
> 
> That which hath been hid from before the foundation of the world is
> revealed to babes and sucklings in the last days.
> 
> The world is reserved unto burning in the last days. He shall send
> Elijah the prophet, and he shall reveal the covenants of the fathers
> in relation to the children, and the covenants of the children in

>

> everlasting covenant, thereby making their calling and election sure.
> When a seal is put upon the father and mother, it secures their
> posterity, so that they cannot be lost, but will be saved by virtue of
> the covenant to their father and mother.

If this wasn’t cryptic enough, Jo’s final words in the sermon are quite
revealing. “To the mourners I would say, do as the husband and the
father would instruct you, and you shall be reunited.” This was a mere
month after the polygamy revelation had been given and presented to the
High Council. Any time we see the terms of new and everlasting covenant
in this period of Nauvoo history, it’s talking about the doctrine of
sealing in the context of polygamy. There is no other available
definition for that phrase from Nauvoo. Other mysterious and untimely
deaths had occurred connected to polygamy and Jo’s funeral sermon for
Elias Higbee reading so cryptically can be viewed as such. I’ll readily
admit how incredibly speculative it is that Elias Higbee was killed for
opposition to polygamy, but I’m equally speculative in believing the
same was the case for Don Carlos Smith, Jo’s youngest brother,
especially when Jo married his widowed sister-in-law only a month after
Don Carlos’s death. Who knows, if Jo had lived another year he may have
added Francis and Chauncey Higbee’s mom, Sarah Elizabeth Ward, to his
harem.

Jo wasn’t done preaching that day. After a few other speakers had talked
for a bit, Jo got back on the stand.

> I had forgotten one thing: we have had certain traders in this city
> who have been writing falsehoods to Missouri; and there is a certain
> man in this city who has made a covenant to betray and give me up to
> the Missourians,… That man is no other than Sidney Rigdon: this
> testimony I have from gentlemen from abroad, whose names I do not wish
> to give.

This is when Rigdon was excommunicated by Jo for his work with Bennett,
the post office fiasco, Nancy Rigdon, and half a dozen other
disagreements which signaled to Jo that Hingepin Rigdon wasn’t a
loyalist. The main issue here is that the Higbee brothers were
considered to be in league with Rigdon at this time. Francis Higbee and
Nancy Rigdon were even close friends before Jo tried to rape her and
Francis gave the Happiness Letter to Wreck-it Bennett. Nancy was
understandably angry with Francis Higbee for casting her name further
into the public light by sharing so much with Bennett, but the fact
remained that Jo considered Rigdon and Francis Higbee both enemies. His
speech at this time was aimed at Rigdon just as much as the implication
was aimed at those Rigdon was in conspiracy with.

A month after this speech during the same gathering of Elias Higbee’s
funeral, Francis Higbee sent a letter to Jo to try and be the bigger man
and bury the hatchet.

> My father’s death has been enough,… When taken in connection with
> other things of less moment, to engage my whole attention without
> seeking to draw down upon my own head, the heads of my mother’s
> family, another scourge, such as we suffered in Missouri. Who suffered
> more and hazarded life oftener than did I—God forbid that ever I
> should be instrumental in bringing destruction not only upon my
> friends, but upon myself and relatives—then, Sir, please read this, or
> announce to the public that the charge with which I stand charged is
> *false, false, false,* and greatly oblige.

Jo did oblige by inviting Francis Higbee over to a house party. They
apparently settled affairs briefly and Jo “expressed himself satisfied
that Col. Francis M. Higbee was free, even of reproach or suspicion, in
that matter.” Once again, this peace was short-lived.

By the very end of 1843, Jo was again distrusting of Francis Higbee and
ranting against him in High Council meetings. Jo had recommended that
other young men should “better withdraw from his \[Higbee’s\] society,
and let him stand on his own merits… \[Higbee\] had better be careful or
a train of facts would be disclosed concerning him that he would not
like,…” The minutes of the meeting seem to tell only half the story
because Francis Higbee fired off another letter to Jo and it is
absolutely dripping with venom from how Francis had been treated in such
a petty way by Jo.

No investigation into Joseph Smith was ever held because of course it
wasn’t. Jo continued to rail against Higbee in private councils and that
information eventually found its way back to ol Franky boy through the
gossip network. Finally, Francis had enough.

A poem was published anonymously titled Buckeye’s Lamentation for Want
of More Wives. This poem details some important and salacious details of
Nauvoo polygamy and prostitution around town. Historian Gary Bergera
postulates that this poem was actually written by Francis Higbee amid
the pending Bostwick lawsuit for which he was lawyer. It is an
interesting assertion but Bergera makes a strong case for it being
Francis and I’m inclined to agree with it. Considering everything
Francis had suffered because of Jo, resorting to subterfuge by way of
this scathing poem must have been a cathartic outlet.

The trial of Orsimus F. Bostwick is something we’ve talked about it on
the show before. Essentially Bostwick claimed that Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff
Smith was teaching plural marriage and Hyrum sued Bostwick for slander.
Francis Higbee was Bostwick’s lawyer during the trial, chaired by Mayor
and King Jo, and it was, of course, ruled in Hyrum’s favor and therefore
Bostwick was on the hook for a $50 fine. Francis Higbee appealed the
case to the circuit court at Carthage, which Jo said would bring the mob
down upon us in his public speech railing against Higbee. Luckily for
Jo, he died before the appeal process was resolved.

Spring of 1844 brought the Higbee brothers, Chauncey and Francis, the
Foster brothers we discussed last week, Charles and Robert, and the Law
brothers, William and Wilson which we’ll discuss next week, into sharp
focus as the most acute threats to the church. On March 24, 1844 Jo
preached from the pulpit:

> I have been informed by two gentlemen that a conspiracy is got up in
> this place for the purpose of taking the life of President Joseph
> Smith, his family, and all the Smith family, and the heads of the
> church. One of the gentlemen will give his name to the public, and the
> other wishes it to be hid for the present. They will both testify to
> it on oath and make an affidavit upon it. The names of the persons
> revealed at the head of the conspiracy are as follows:--Cha\[u\]ncey
> L. Higbee, Dr. Robert D. Foster, Mr. Joseph H. Jackson, William and
> Wilson Law. And the lies that C.L. Higbee has hatched up as a
> foundation to work upon are—he says that I had men’s heads cut off in
> Missouri, and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the people
> that I wanted to kill and put out of the way. I won’t swear out a
> warrant against them for I don’t fear any of them, they would not
> scare off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity
> that I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready to bear it.

While Francis Higbee wasn’t named directly in that list of conspirators
to murder the prophet, his long-running association and familial
connection with those named implicated him as well.

A week after this speech, Chauncey Higbee accosted Jo on the street and
Jo charged him with “abusive indecent and threatening language” for
which Chauncey was fined $10 plus court costs after his motion to
dismiss was ignored by Jo’s banana republic municipal court.

Both Foster brothers became the target of the prophet’s smear campaign
as he entered the national stage to run for president. Chauncey was with
the Fosters when the marshal deputized all three men to assist him in
the arrest of Augustine Spencer and Charles Foster aimed a pistol at
Jo’s chest. During the fray, Chauncey Higbee said “\[I\] would be God
damnd. if \[I\] did not shoot \[you\]… \[I\] would consider favord of
God—for the privilege of shooting. or ridding the world of such a
Tyr\[a\]nt” All three were arrested and fined $100 a piece. Chauncey
Higbee, Robert Foster, and Charles Foster appealed the decision to be
taken to the circuit court in Carthage to be heard during the June
session, conveniently when Hyrum’s case against Orsimus Bostwick was
scheduled to be heard in Carthage as well. Neither Jo nor Hyrum survived
for either of these hearings.

After the judgement was made against these three men including Chauncey
Higbee, Francis M. Higbee was fed up. He sought final legal recourse for
what he considered unrelenting and complete tyranny. Francis filed a
lawsuit against Joseph Smith for the sum of $5000 in damages for
defamation and slander. But, because Francis had long been fed up with
Jo’s complete control of the court; digression, some historians call
what Jo did with the Nauvoo Municipal court merely “tampering” but that
supposes a baseline of fairness from which Jo tugged and pulled on
occasion. I disagree, he was judge jury and executioner of Nauvoo’s
court system. He didn’t manipulate the system, he was the system.
Francis had suffered from that fact for years and he wasn’t going to
deal with it anymore so he filed the lawsuit in Carthage instead of
Nauvoo. This meant a Carthage official needed to arrest Joseph Smith and
bring him to the circuit court there, at the county seat, which
superseded the Nauvoo Municipal court. What did Jo do? Well, he allowed
himself to be arrested by the Nauvoo marshal, John P. Greene because
Nauvoo ordinances dictated this as legal, then he held a hearing in
secret which granted his writ of habeas corpus and the case went away.
Besides, if an officer from outside Nauvoo entered the city with the
intent of arresting Joseph Smith, another Nauvoo Ordinance dictated that
person to be arrested and imprisoned for life. Jo was bulletproof and
Francis Higbee knew that more than anybody.

The Council of Fifty meeting on May 6<sup>th</sup> contains a report by
Hingepin Sidney Rigdon after he’d met with the Laws, Fosters, and
Higbees to see what was really going on.

> Er Rigdon reported that he had had a labor with the Laws without

So, where does that leave us? Exactly where we left off last week, this
small entry in Jo’s journal for May 7<sup>th</sup>, 1844.

> An opposition printing press arrived at Dr \[Robert D.\] Fosters

The Higbees were O.G. Mormons from the earliest Kirtland era of the
church. They were used, abused, driven from their homes multiple times,
maybe assassinated for their opposition to polygamy, died from sickness,
and generally suffered incredible amounts of abuse by Joseph Smith and
his church. Elias and his sons were members of the church for over a
decade before Chauncey was excommunicated for doing what Jo was doing
but doing it too publicly or without Jo’s permission or something. Elias
died. Francis fought the prophet in the court system repeatedly, the
only way us citizens have to right wrongs committed upon us by another
citizen. At the end of it all, what was the greatest sin the Higbees
committed? Following the rules. That was it, they followed the rules.
The rules of law and rules of culturally dictated monogamy. That was
their slight against the one true prophet. They bowed to the despotic
system of the Nauvoo theocracy for years and tried to make life work but
Jo was a weak human and considered them a threat. Accordingly, he waged
public square warfare against the Higbees repeatedly until he’s
successfully destroyed their characters, destroyed any opportunity
either brother had of finding a wife, and completely obliterated any
familial and community relationships they’d formed. The Higbees filing
lawsuits and speaking against the prophet were purely reactionary to Jo
the tyrant flexing on people he perceived as weaker in status than he.

Chauncey and Francis Higbee fought long and hard to live in an equal
society but the simple fact remained that the deck was stacked against
them. No matter how hard they played, no matter how good their poker
face, Jo always had a trick ace in the sleeve. People can only handle so
much of this kind of abuse from a figure in power before they do
something to flip the table and change the game. That’s what we’re
witnessing in a slow and grueling process. The Higbees, the Fosters, and
the Laws had placed their hands underneath the table in preparation of
flipping the Mormon empire game into complete and utter chaos.

Hey y’all, you heard it at the top of the episode. We have an upcoming
event this April 19<sup>th</sup> in Salt Lake City. However, given the
current trends related to COVID-19 or Coronavirus, the organizers and
myself have decided to postpone the event. The FAA has issued travel
restrictions on many countries to contain the spread and the CDC has
issued a number of guidelines to best protect people against infection.
I live up here in Seattle with the nation’s largest outbreak of the
virus and if actions Seattle has taken is any indicator of what other
states will be doing in the coming months, the Salt Lake City Library
probably won’t even be open for non-essential meetings for us to even
hold the event if we didn’t postpone it.

I’m very disappointed with this development. However, I know that
certain people are more vulnerable to being infected by this specific
virus and I don’t want them to be excluded from the event should their
doctors or any federal agencies recommend they shouldn’t attend
something like this. The Utah Psychedelic Society organizers and myself
explored ways we could still possibly hold it but none of them could
work. So, what does that mean for you if you’ve already bought your
tickets? They’ll still be valid when the event happens. Like I said,
we’re just postponing, not canceling. If you’d like a refund instead
that’s no problem. The Eventbrite page will be updated to reflect our
postponement this upcoming ides of March weekend.

If you were looking forward to the lecture and the tour of Gilgal
gardens, or even the VIP dinner afterwards… I’m sorry. But, this is the
best decision and trust me I’ve weighed out a lot of different options.
The risk of somebody actually becoming infected is very small, but I
couldn’t sleep at night knowing I was responsible for somebody being
infected. It’s simply better to not take the risk and hold the event at
a later time when we have more information and risk of infection is
lower.

If Sunstone in Salt Lake City isn’t canceled this year, I’ll be
presenting on psychedelics in occult traditions with my copresenter,
Brian Kassenbrock, who’ll present on entheogens in the Book of Mormon.
That’ll be, as always, the last week of July 2020.
