Ep 206 – I’d’ve Gone West and Raised A Mightier People

On this episode, the chaos following the destruction of the Nauvoo
Expositor continues to escalate. Joseph Smith calls together a military
parade as a show of force to any enemies in the city where he gives his
final public speech as first Prophet of Mormonism. Jo’s cronies are
active in collecting affidavits concerning the movements of the Illinois
militias near Mormon settlements. Whether or not they’re true is hard to
tell but daily extras flowing from the antagonistic Warsaw Signal give
some credence to some of the allegations. Governor Thomas Ford
eventually makes his way to Carthage to figure out just what was going
on. We spend a bit of time discussing the conflict from Governor Ford’s
History of Illinois and use that to consider the many conflicting
interests involved in the coming Illinois-Mormon War.

The Nauvoo Expositor had been destroyed and the city was in turmoil.
Joseph Smith had intel from all over the state that various groups were
forming mobs to descend upon the Mormon settlements. These mobs sought
peaceful resolution to the Mormon leadership’s flagrant abuse of their
own legal system but tensions were high and any unexpected spark could
set off the powder-keg.

Our timeline currently rests on the morning of June 18<sup>th</sup>,
1844. Joseph and Hyrum would be dead in barely a week’s time but they
were implementing every tool at their disposal to extricate themselves
from their past transgressions. Jo had nearly declared martial law. He
had credible threats that the printers of the Expositor were planning on
destroying the Mormon press of the Nauvoo Neighbor and a nightguard
watch was set around the Neighbor, at the wharf where folks would
disembark from the Mississippi where ferries were also tightly monitored
by Jo’s shadow force, the Danites. Jo also staked out a platoon of his
personal bodyguards to watch over his home in the night. Mortal threats
were a reality and Jo was flexing his Nauvoo Legion muscles to exhibit
for his enemies that he was well-protected.

On the morning of the 18<sup>th</sup>, Jo called on Major-General
Jonathan Dunham, a Danite, to gather the first cohort of the Legion in
front of Jo’s house that morning for a military parade. Parade is too
happy of a word for what actually happened, this was actually
intimidation. If Jo could walk the streets of Nauvoo peacefully
surrounded by his Legionnaires it creates a sense of shock and awe for
any of his enemies watching him so daringly walking around the city in
broad daylight.

Just like every good military leader, Jonathan Dunham gathered the first
cohort at 9 A.M.\! in front of Jo’s house. Any of our military or former
military listeners, question for you. Is that how military operations
usually run? Everybody has a good meal of pork and beans, bread, coffee,
milks the family cow, feeds the horses, maybe talks to their kids about
schoolwork before mustering for military duty at 9 A.M.? That’s how it
goes, right? So they got together in front of Jo’s house. He’d been up
really late the previous night sending out orders, receiving and sending
letters, intercepting letters meant for his enemies, and he got a late
start on the morning. However, some good news awaited Jo upon waking.

> I was informed that there were several boxes of arms landed at the
> upper stone house, which were secured by the marshal. Soon after, it
> was discovered that the arms (40 stand) had been sent by H. G.
> Sherwood and the marshal bought them for the city.

What is a stand of arms? A stand is a complete set good enough for one
soldier which includes, the rifle, bayonet, powder horn, ball pouch, and
leather carrying strap; this shipment procured by Henry Sherwood was
good enough to fit out 40 Legionnaires with a weapon and necessary
equipment. We often overlook the logistics of running a militia in these
days but a militia without enough weapons isn’t good for much. The
equipment of the Nauvoo Legion was largely a patchwork of whatever each
soldier could acquire for themselves as the Legion itself simply didn’t
have many arms to issue. Guns were a precious commodity and to have 40
show up in the morning was good news for the prophet.

There was a lot of growing pressure in the state of Illinois. Every
letter Jo received described dire straits and confusion from the Mormon
settlements. Those who were threatened the most were furthest
disconnected from Nauvoo, particularly Uncle John in Macedonia and Isaac
Morley in Yelrom. Both those cities were intersected by the anti-Mormon
settlements of Carthage and Warsaw, cutting them off from the main
contingent of the Nauvoo Legion in the city. News of Jo’s release from
his sham Municipal court hearing from the previous day was beginning to
set ablaze the anti-Mormons. They wanted justice and the hearing Jo had
a week ago wasn’t it. This second hearing which discharged the prisoners
on riot, we discussed it last week, would be sure to excite their
vigilante proclivities.

A man named Truman Gillett, he’s made a couple appearances on the show
before but nothing really consequential, had just arrived this morning
in Nauvoo from a Mississippi steamer. Along with dozens of others at
this time he made an affidavit of intel he’d received while on the
steamer. He told his story to White-out Willard Richards acting as
recorder for the city. There’s a lot to discuss, which we’ll do after
reading the affidavit but by way of introduction, Truman apparently
witnessed a conversation between two men on the steamer who were
colluding with William Law to kidnap and kill Joseph Smith.

> TRUMAN GILLETT, jun.

Who these men were that were colluding with William Law, we’ll never
know. When they planned to put their plan into effect, we’ll never know.
Whether the conversation with the two men was completely fabricated and
we can slap the label of “fake news” on the whole affidavit, we’ll never
know. That’s the trouble with all the affidavits collected in Nauvoo
during these middle two weeks of June 1844. It’s affidavits like this,
most-likely spawning from mere rumors in the first place, which just
heightened the excitement of the situation. While we can’t determine how
accurate the affidavit is with historical hindsight, what we do know is
that the decisions made following affidavits like this were heavily
influenced by said affidavits.

Reacting to the intel he’d received the previous evening and all these
affidavits, and probably wanting to flex a little bit more, Jo made a
crucial mistake around noon on this day. Here it is

> To the Marshal or the City of Nauvoo:
> 
> From the newspapers around us, and the current reports as brought in
> from the surrounding country, I have good reason to fear that a mob is
> organizing to come upon this city, and plunder and destroy said city,
> as well as murder the citizens; and by virtue of the authority vested
> in me as mayor, and to preserve the city and lives of the citizens, I
> do hereby declare the said city,… under martial law. The officers,
> therefore, of the Nauvoo Legion, the police, as well as all others
> will strictly see that no persons or property pass in or out of the
> city without due orders.
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

Now, Nauvoo was officially under a declaration of martial law by the
highest-ranking commanding officer of the legion who also happened to be
the mayor of the city and the sole authority religious leader of the
near-total majority Mormon city. Here represents the greatest underlying
issue people had with Joseph Smith and his religious movement. He was in
total control of all three pillars of societal organizations, military,
government, and religious. He was the top of these three pillars and the
fourth pillar of societal organizations, the press, had just been
forcefully subjugated to his power with the destruction of the Expositor
printing press. Beyond that, when a military leader declares martial
law, it opens up a wide range of powers not otherwise enjoyed by the
government. It allows the military to infringe on constitutional rights
by quartering soldiers, limiting movement, instating curfews, directing
factories for wartime production, and drafting soldiers from citizens
among other things. It also opens up emergency funding. But, because
it’s such a broad power, it’s very rarely used because non-combatants
lose their minds under martial law. Rights aren’t rights if the
government can take them away at a moment’s notice. They’re temporary
privileges and Jo took those privileges away in response to his own act
of fascism and the ensuing chaos. This would prove to be a massive
mistake as the people, Mormon and non-Mormon alike, groaned under the
increased powers granted by the declaration of martial law in the city.

In accordance with this new declaration, Jo held his parade in full
battle regalia that same afternoon. The number of Legionnaires who
filled the streets for this parade is unknown but suspected to be a few
hundred with the first cohort under the command of acting
brigadier-general Piggy-bank Stephen Markham, and the second cohort
under Colonel Hosea Stout, acting under the direction of major-general
Jonathan Dunham. They mustered their powder and ball in full uniform and
gathered on the street in front of the Nauvoo Mansion, where Joseph
Smith “stood in full uniform on the top of the frame of a building.”
Here, Joseph made his final public speech as first prophet of the
Mormons. Yes, I mean it, his FINAL public speech. There’s so much to
tease out of this speech. It lasted about an hour and a half and a
synopsis was recorded by Joseph G. Hovey, William G. Sterret, Robert
Campbell, George A. Smith, and a few others who remembered what was said
after the event. We have to take what’s recorded with a grain of salt as
it was recorded initially by Robert Campbell, and was supplemented at a
later time by statements from these other men. Regardless of the source
for it, the speech does a fantastic review of everything that’s happened
the last few weeks on the podcast. Let’s dig in.

That was Jo’s final public sermon before his death. He did it to a crowd
of hundreds or thousands, in full battle regalia, standing atop a
building under construction to carry his voice further, given to the
first 2 cohorts of the Nauvoo Legion. There’s a very famous portrait of
Joseph Smith standing on scaffolding with the Nauvoo Mansion and the
Nauvoo Temple in the background with crowds of people listening to him
while his sword is raised to the sky and Hyrum and presumably a red-coat
William Clayton standing behind him. Some of you have probably seen it.
That portrait depicts Jo’s last public speech we just read and it was
painted in 1888 by a guy named John Hafen. This is one of those few
times where we can actually visualize history and I encourage you to do
so by clicking the link to the painting in the show notes.

After this grand speech, Jo took his militia and “with my staff rode in
front of the Legion, marched up Main Street, and returned to our former
parade ground.” This was no benign military parade, this was a show of
force. This was done to effectively intimidate any enemies of the
prophet as he rode around the city, surrounded by hundreds or possibly
even a thousand or two of his uniformed soldiers who were all willing to
give their life in exchange for the prophet’s safety. But to consider
the broader context of what he’d done in his court system the past week,
all the letters he’d sent, all the threats he’d received, in some ways
an enemy watching this parade must have felt defeated. Look, we know
what happens in a week, but nobody watching this parade did. If a person
is sitting back and considering the tactics of the Mormon vs.
anti-Mormon battlefield before us, Jo had won. He got his court to throw
out the charges against him, he’d defied arrest warrants with impunity,
even if the state militia invaded Nauvoo he was surrounded by thousands
of men who owed fealty to only him, not to their family or country, but
their cult leader. He must have seemed untouchable.

But that was merely the outward appearance he put on as this show of
force. What was really going through his mind was a complex game of
defensive plays to keep him, his family, and his legacy secure. Upon the
dismissal of the Legion, Jo retired to his home to exchange more letters
and review affidavits being collected about the movements of the
anti-Mormons surrounding Nauvoo. An ever-present question remained in
Jo’s mind, how quickly could Talos be mobilized. Talos is our
metaphorical war machine being constructed in sheds and dark alleys of
the city of Nauvoo. The leadership spent the last 5 years collecting
armor, machinery, weapons, and the energy source for this war machine.
Each Mormon convert thickened the armor. Each new factory equipped Talos
with stronger machinery. Each new conscript to the Nauvoo Legion added
killing power to the weapon system. Each proclamation of persecution
from the stand fueled Talos with a deeper energy source. Years of
construction and preparation had been devoted to this Mormon
revolutionary war machine, set to blaze a path into the great unknown
west where it could become stronger and better-equipped for as complete
and total warpath straight to Washington. For Joseph Smith, the fact
that he was so heavily considering dragging the Talos prototype out of
Nauvoo and take it West before it was ready seemed like an only option.
The Rocky Mountains would provide enough cover for Talos to gather
strength and the Great Basin was clearly on Jo’s mind. His vehicle of
choice was his Mormon war machine but was it ready? The contents of his
letters reveal to me that he thought it wasn’t yet time, but the time
was nearing.

When Jo finished writing this letter, “messengers arrived from Carthage,
and report that the mob had received intelligence from the governor,”.
This was big news. Both the Mormons and the anti-Mormons were awaiting
communication from Governor Thomas Ford to determine how to act and
whose side he would take. Ford was a smart guy and we’ll see his
intellect play further into the coming week of Nauvoo history, but both
sides wanted his blessing to do whatever they needed to the other side.
Jo wanted Governor Ford to recognize what was happening as religious
persecution and baseless. The anti-Mormons wanted Governor Ford to
recognize the outrages committed by the Mormons and that burning the
Expositor printing press was the final straw. Whoever Ford sided with
would win the day and everybody’s decisions hinged on communication from
Governor Ford. Also worth pointing out, both sides were asking Governor
Ford to attend to the matters personally instead of sending
representatives. If we remember back to the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838,
this was the primary complaint the Mormons and anti-Mormons there had
with Governor Lilburn Boggs; the dude never left his office and just
took meetings, wrote letters, and sent representatives. His personal
presence would have given the weight of the government to whichever side
he chose. Boggs’ refusal to appear in person exacerbated the problems
and Jo was determined to not have that same mistake again made. I would
assume that Governor Ford also learned from Governor Boggs’ mistakes and
this issue took precedence over everything else going on in his life at
the time.

There was a problem though, information traveled at the speed of a
horse. Governor Ford was only receiving the first letters and meetings
with folks from Nauvoo and Carthage about the situation and he wasn’t up
to speed on what was going on in the cities at the time. He hadn’t yet
received Jo’s letters about the Nauvoo municipal hearings which
discharged him on the charges of riot. He’d yet to receive the latest
resolution passed by the anti-Mormons in Carthage for their meeting on
the 14<sup>th</sup> of June which called for a war of extermination
against the Mormons. All he knew by the 18<sup>th</sup> was that the
Mormons had burned down a printing press. However, upon receiving these
meetings and letters Governor Ford resolved to immediately travel to the
area himself and likely began his roughly 5-day journey on the
19<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup>.

But, because Governor Ford wasn’t yet there, rumors circulated about who
he would side with upon his arrival. Accordingly, “the mob damned the
governor as being as bad as “Jo Smith”. The \[anti-Mormons\] did not
care for him, and they were just as willing he would not help them, as
if he would.” Also, two guys named Cyrus Canfield and Gilbert Belknap
made an affidavit about what they witnessed the prior day in Carthage.

> \[Affiants\] say, that on yesterday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, 1844, at
> Carthage, certain persons, to-wit, Dr.\_\_\_\_\_ Barnes and Joseph H.
> Jackson, having entered into conversation with your deponents, among

> were coming to Nauvoo with a sufficient force to take Smith, and if
> the people endeavored to prevent them, they should kill the people;
> and that if Smith had left Nauvoo, they had determined to destroy the
> mansion and other buildings.

Affidavits like this fill the pages of the History of the Church. Did
this actually happen? Did these men actually witness Barnes and Jackson
talking about killing all the Mormons and burning down the city? What
they claim in the affidavit after what I just read is even more
speculative and fascinating to me.

> your deponents further say that one John Eller declared that heh had
> lived in Missouri and was at the massacre of the Mormons at Haun’s
> Mill; that he had killed one Mormon, and that he had left Missouri on
> purpose to fight the Mormons, and would hunt a Mormon as he would a
> deer.

Did these men actually witness a person boasting about killing a Mormon
at Haun’s Mill? Was he actually a Missourian who fought in the
Missouri-Mormon war or was he just the town drunkard talking a big game
like usual? But, the affidavit didn’t stop there.

> your deponents further say that they heard that about one hundred

No only was this guy talking about killing a Mormon during the Haun’s
Mill massacre, but there were as many as a hundred other men who’d
arrived in Carthage from Missouri with provisions for war against the
Mormons in Nauvoo. True or not, it had weight and many other affidavits
like this fill page after page of the History of the Church. Another
affidavit by Carlos W. Lyon claimed “while at St. Louis, \[Missouri\] it
was a common topic that they were furnishing arms and ammunition to be
sent by steamboat to Warsaw, Illinois, and said if the people of Warsaw
need five hundred men to give notice… and… also saw a cannon landed from
the steamer *Mermaid* at Warsaw,”. Multiple affidavits from Allen T.
Wait, Solomon Hancock, William Garner, John G. Lofton, Isaac Morley,
Gardner Snow, Edmund Durfee all claim that the vicious anti-Mormon Levi
Williams was running around with a posse and seizing arms from the
Mormons, forcing them to either fight with him or fight against him
alongside their prophet. They claim that this evil Levi Williams said
“\[he\] would take Smith by law if they could, or if the Governor
would not grant a writ to take him, they would take him anyhow; he also
said that if the people would not give Smith up, they would lay the
whole city of Nauvoo in ashes.” They further claimed that Levi Williams
had absolutely no regard for the law and that “they intended to proceed
against the Mormons, whether they got any authority from the Governor or
not.”

Another affidavit about Colonel Levi Williams, that Colonel of the
Illinois militia, definitely NOT the Nauvoo Legion, Levi Williams was
one of the 5 people put on trial for murdering Joseph and Hyrum, he was
not a friend of the Mormons. But another affidavit detailed exactly what
Levi Williams would do to ensure compliance with his evil anti-Mormon
campaign to kill the prophet.

According to this affidavit, given by Anson Call, David Evans, and
William E. Horner, Colonel Levi Williams wanted to tar and feather the
circuit judge for not issuing a new arrest warrant for Jo after the
first one had failed to bring him to Carthage. Further, Jo received
intel from somebody about a troubling development incited by the enemy,
Colonel Levi Williams, who was displeased that a Captain Loveland of the
Illinois State militia wouldn’t participate in the Mormon arresting
posse.

> On Sunday the 16<sup>th</sup> a committee of the mob,… went to the
> house of Captain Chester Loveland, who lives four miles southeast of

> peremptorily refused to comply with their request; the same posse

Basically, Captain Loveland refused to join Colonel Levi Williams in
arresting the prophet and the posse returned with an explicit order from
Governor Thomas Ford telling Loveland to comply; Loveland presumed it
was a forgery. He still refused and they nearly tarred and feathered him
then lynched him for not calling his platoon and joining the arresting
posse in their invasion of Nauvoo to arrest Jo. Understandably, Colonel
Levi Williams hated Joseph Smith and wanted the prophet to answer for
his crimes, but would he go to the lengths of threatening a fellow
member of the Illinois militia with death for not helping him? It seems
to strain credulity, but that’s a theme throughout many of these
affidavits. Can we trust any of them? Can we believe the contents of any
of these affidavits to be true?

If we turn over to the Warsaw Signal, printed by one of the founding
fathers of the anti-Mormon political movement, Thomas Coke Sharp, we can
see substantiation for some of these claims made in these affidavits.
Notably, one of the resolutions of one of their many meetings stated:
“The citizens of this county are ordered to assemble at their various
places of rendezvous, on Wednesday Next, by the Officer, from whom Smith
was rescued \[that’s Colonel Levi Williams\] and there to receive
general orders to co-operate as a posse to aid in arresting Smith.” In
addition to this order to comply with Colonel Levi Williams, Thomas
Sharp also added to the same edition of the Warsaw Signal this
fascinating detail which complicated matters but also adds weight to the
affidavits made in Nauvoo stating the anti-Mormons were being supported
by the Missourians.

> Citizens of the adjoining State \[Missouri\], Territory and Counties,
> who feel interested in bringing to justice the most depraved wretch on
> earth, will observe that they can join our standard, and act with the
> *posse comitatus* without violating the Law. We are all prepared in

> comitatus*; being assured that the citizens of surrounding counties,
> and of Missouri and Iowa will join us. As soon as the day for a

> citizens in the adjacent country.

The anti-Mormons in Carthage and Warsaw calling on the oldest enemies of
the Mormons, the Missourians, for support amped up the excitement even
more. In that same edition of the Warsaw Signal it also reported details
of the support the anti-Mormons were receiving.

The fact of the matter is, this was a chaotic time in Nauvoo and
Illinois at large. Rumors were spread and rumors became affidavits, and
affidavits could be given by anybody claiming anything and those
affidavits carried weight. How did they carry weight? Well, permit me to
read a brief letter that Jo drafted on June 20<sup>th</sup> with the
power of all these affidavits behind it.

> \[John Tyler\]
> 
> Sir:--I have just enclosed to the Governor of the State of Illinois

> JOSEPH SMITH, Mayor.

Yeah, Joseph Smith wrote to the President of the United States asking
for protection against this new wave of what he called persecution.
Also, a brief sidenote… Joseph Smith, you’re addressing the president of
the United States and you called yourselves Mormons?\! Come on man,
couldn’t you see the future to know that in 2020 that was a victory for
Satan? My point remains, whether or not the contents of the affidavits
was true, they carried weight and found their way to not only Governor
Thomas Ford but to President John Tyler as well. Of course, the
president never replied because by the time he received the letter the
problem was kind of solved but still; these affidavits were believed to
be true even if the person giving the affidavit completely fabricated
it.

It should also be noted that the Mormon affidavits wasn’t the only
misinformation making its way to Governor Thomas Ford. He reports
information coming to him during his trip from Springfield to Carthage
to handle the situation as “of the most fearful character.”

Governor Thomas Ford simply couldn’t trust a single thing he heard from
anybody. It was a complex situation with lots of moving parts and all
this complication was exacerbated by the constant flow of
misinformation. Thomas Ford was a good guy. He knew the history of the
Mormons in Missouri and while he couldn’t come out openly and say it, he
knew that if he bungled this up the way Boggs did he might get a visit
from Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell too so he was extra cautious in this
circumstance. Ford wasn’t influenced as much as the citizens of Hancock
county because he wasn’t a citizen there himself. That made put Governor
Ford in the tough position of not truly empathizing with either side,
but still having the force and power of the law behind anything he did
while trying to see clearly from his 30,000 foot view of the
circumstances. Ford was also smart enough to see people’s personal
motivations in blowing up this latest controversy during an election
year.

Not only was everything the Mormons did the next outrage de-jour for the
people to get excited about, but failing politicians who were too proud
to curry the Mormon vote used the outrage as an opportunity to step up
and exhibit leadership and make themselves look better in the eyes of
the public. Anybody who opposed violent extermination of the Mormons
were considered Mormon sympathizers, the Jack Mormons of the day, and
were threatened with the same extermination the Mormons would suffer.
And, as Governor Ford points out, this was the result of the Mormons
voting as a bloc instead of their own preferences because if they voted
individually then people like Colonel Levi Williams and other
politicians trying to make a name for themselves wouldn’t use the
Mormons as a wedge issue.

There are simply so many angles by which to consider this conflict and
so many factors which played into all of it. Thomas Coke Sharp at the
Warsaw signal bears a fair amount of blame for fanning these flames
because in addition to daily extras the Signal printed, the issue which
contained the resolutions to exterminate the Mormons also reprinted
witness statements from the Missouri-Mormon war court of inquiry wherein
Doctor Sampson Avard testified about the existence of the Danites and
the movements of the Mormon extra-military shadow force. However,
Sampson Avard never would have testified about the Danites if Jo and
Hingepin Rigdon hadn’t created the Danites amidst a war against the
state of Missouri and the Danites couldn’t be used as ammunition against
the Mormons during this next impending war we’re seeing come into
sharper focus every episode. However, because the Missouri-Mormon war
had happened and the Danites were a real thing, the fury which fueled
the anti-Mormons in Illinois had deep roots in Missouri from a decade
before. There’s just so much to consider here and Governor Ford knew
that as well.

As soon as Governor Ford arrived in Carthage to figure out just what the
hell was going on, he sent a letter to Joseph Smith.

> To the Hon. The Mayor and Common Council of the City of Nauvoo:
> 
> Gentlemen.—Having heard of the excitement in this part of the country,
> and judging that my presence here might be necessary to preserve the
> peace and enforce the laws, I arrived at this place this morning. Both

> uninfluenced either by the excitement here or in your city.
> 
> I think before any decisive measure shall be adopted that I ought to

> 
> For these reasons I have to request that you will send out to me at

> 
> Col. Elam S. Freeman will present you this note in the character of a

> will be returned to you in safety.
> 
> I am, gentlemen, with high consideration, most respectfully,
> 
> Your obedient servant,
> 
> THOMAS FORD
> 
> Governor and Commander in Chief.

As soon as Jo received this message from Governor Ford, he called
together the Nauvoo City Council for the last time under his office as
Mayor where they read all the affidavits discussed today and on last
week’s episode, compiled them all together and wrote this brief line in
reply to Governor Ford.

> Sir:--The affidavits and handbills herewith connected are submitted
> for your Excellency’s consideration.
> 
> Respectfully, I have the honor to be
> 
> Your obedient servant,
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH

With this folder of affidavits and handbills under arm, John Bernhisel
and second prophet of the Salt Lake City church, John Taylor, set off
for Carthage suspecting they would not be harmed during their mission.

Now that Governor Thomas Ford was on scene, a new set of factors needed
to be considered in the calculus of both the Mormons and the
anti-Mormons. Now that daddy was in town, both sides needed to figure
out how best to explain their conduct to get him on their side and make
him punish the other. Whoever Governor Ford sided with, broader Illinois
history would reflect his decisions for decades to come. I’ve tried to
put myself in his head for this time but it’s impossible and his History
of Illinois provides little insight as the book is such a cold
recitation of events with very little personal commentary. Really, what
would a person do in his situation? The Mormons had acted in such a way
that the state of Missouri had exterminated them and Governor Lilburn
Boggs completely botched it. How was Governor Ford to keep his state
from devolving into the same frenzy? If he mishandled it as Boggs had,
his political career couldn’t take the hit and he may even be
assassinated like Port had attempted with Lilburn Boggs. This was an
absolute minefield for Governor Ford to walk into and too many competing
interests made facts are scarce commodity when facts were exactly what
Ford needed to conduct his office properly. Beyond the act of tyranny
from burning the Expositor printing press, the Mormons were far more
lawless than inciting a riot. There was all the stuff about robbing
people, manufacturing bogus, and the questionable validity of the Nauvoo
Charter to begin with weighing in the balance. Could the Expositor issue
be disentangled and handled separately from these other criminal acts?
Could a Governor effectively prosecute a prophet, priest, and king
operating a government within a government? Could the anti-Mormons be
deescalated from their precipice? Could the Mormons be brought into
conformity with the law without them crying persecution? More
importantly in the day-to-day decision-making… who could be trusted?
Even if Governor Ford did everything perfectly could he rely on any of
the anti-Mormons conducting themselves impartially? Was anything anybody
said true, and how does one make a good decision with such little
verifiable information amidst chaos and misinformation?

When I try to view the world through Governor Ford’s eyes, I can’t envy
his position. For that matter though, I don’t envy any of the people
involved here. Don’t get me wrong, there were plenty of advantages to
capitalize on during this growing conflict. Thomas Coke Sharp’s Warsaw
Signal was selling more copies of the paper than it ever had before.
Colonel Levi Williams was leading the charge against the Mormons in an
effort to posture himself in a decisive and hard-on-crime position for
the coming election. Nationwide Joseph Smith was getting more press than
he ever could buy because papers across the country were covering the
brewing conflict. The Mormons always had multiple locations designated
as their retreat position in the event of another extermination, which
seemed imminent at this point; that location would be far outside the
boundaries of any legal authority and they would be more able to truly
build the theocracy they’d attempted in Nauvoo. If Governor Ford handled
this situation perfectly, he had a good future in politics.

But for each of those positive outlooks there were plenty of drawbacks.
If Governor Ford handled this as terribly as Governor Lilburn Boggs had
handled the Mormon problem in Missouri, his political career, and
possibly his life, were over. If the whole conflict with the Mormons
were just handled in the courts where it belonged, that wasn’t exactly
the climax the Warsaw Signal was riling people up to expect. If Jo was
taken into the courts he’d likely be arrested and the rest of his life
would be clouded with criminal hearings and transfers among prisons in
Illinois and Missouri until he met his demise at the gallows. If Joseph
was arrested, what would happen to the Mormon movement who considered
him their one and only prophet? On the flipside of that proposition,
what if Jo was too well-protected by his militia to arrest and he waged
war against state militias that his Nauvoo Legion far outmanned and
outgunned? The results of another Mormon war would not look as it did in
Missouri because the Mormon leadership had learned so much from their
previous war. Illinois is a big state and there were a lot of non-Mormon
settlements the Mormons could pillage for supplies to sustain a war
effort for months. Plus, they had direct access to the largest
commercial river in America at the time and they could control the
passage of ships on the Mississippi. In fact, the Warsaw Signal reported
on June 19<sup>th</sup>, a day after Jo declared martial law that the
Iowa, a steamer, “reports that she was not allowed to land her
passengers at Nauvoo, the city having been declared by the prophet,
under Martial Law.” While not even engaged in actual war, the martial
law powers of Jo’s kingdom were able to thwart passage of a steamer on
the Mississippi. The Mormon settlement was also very close in proximity
to many Native American settlements and Jo had been currying favor with
chiefs of multiple tribes who were expecting a Mormon revolution as
their opportunity to take revenge against the white man who’d removed
them from their lands. In possibly the most symbolic of any article
published in the Warsaw Signal, the report from Thomas Sharp saying “A
rumor is afloat that the Mormons have melted the type of the Expositor
office and converted them into bullets” summarizes the mentality of the
day more than anything I could ever write.

We simply can’t imagine an analogue of this in America today. Stuff like
this happens all over the globe every day, but a modern-day example of
this happening in America is very hard to bring to reality. I’ve made
this analogy before but it bears repeating. Suppose a chapter of the
Muslim Brotherhood opened up in Oregon and started amassing converts.
Tens of thousands of converts in just a few short years. After just 5
years of gaining tens of thousands of followers, or if we account for
population inflation it would be closer to about 153,000 because Mormons
were about 4% of the Illinois population in 1844. After just 5 years of
this movement gaining traction, they establish their own government,
harbor fugitives, print their own money, and then they seize control of
the Columbia River. The government is flummoxed because every time they
try to send in officers to arrest the leaders those officers are
arrested and imprisoned in the Muslim Brotherhood city. To make matters
worse, the government allows such broad deference to Christian sects so
any laws they pass to overcome the growing power of this Muslim regime
would be discriminatory against one religion. Oh yeah, for this thought
exercise these are all white Muslims and they’re all preppers with
basements full of supplies and guns they can legally stockpile, that
feels like it’s important to make this thought exercise work. They also
have politicians in their pockets. How would the Governor of Oregon deal
with this? How would our president deal with this? Interestingly, this
isn’t even a thought exercise that far away from reality. Remember the
whole Cliven Bundy armed standoff against the government back in 2014
and his son taking over the bird sanctuary a few years later in Oregon?
Google it if you don’t know what I’m talking about. They’re crazy
prepper Mormons steeped in the writings of Cleon Skousen and Ezra Taft
Benson who spent days pointing loaded semi-automatic rifles at FBI
agents for a week. His son called himself Captain Moroni when he took
over the wildlife refuge in 2016. The anti-government, anti-society, and
religious supremacy elements created by Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, and
perfected by Bloody Brigham Young in Utah, are alive and well to this
day even if the armed standoffs and acts of insurrection are at a much
smaller scale. The world of June 1844 makes a lot more sense if Governor
Ford, Thomas Sharp, Levi Williams, and every other non-Mormon citizen of
the state of Illinois could just see the truth; that they were living on
Mormon land, Jo was just nice enough to let them borrow it for now.
