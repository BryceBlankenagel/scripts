Ep 209 – “We Will Be Reconciled to Our Fate”

On this episode, Joseph Smith crossed the Mississippi to go into hiding
from Governor Ford’s arrest order. Emma and his friends blast him for
cowardice and he agrees to finally surrender saying “\[i\]f my life is
of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself.” Joseph and Hyrum
decide to go “like lambs to the slaughter” expecting to be “butchered”
by the anti-Mormons waiting for them in Carthage. However, on their
journey to Carthage, they meet Captain Dunn of the Illinois Militia,
holding an order from Governor Ford for the Nauvoo Legion to surrender
their state-provided arms and cannons. Jo accompanies Captain Dunn to
ensure compliance with the order, running out the clock on Ford’s arrest
order. Finally, Jo and Hyrum, along with 16 other offenders, enter
Carthage to surrender at 5 minutes to midnight on June 24<sup>th</sup>,
1844. The anti-Mormons among the Illinois Militia there celebrate this
small victory.

The Mormon theocracy on the Mississippi was tossed into the throes of
chaos by recent events. Governor Thomas Ford, attempting to enforce the
law of the land, had been very clear in his letter to Joseph Smith and
personal communication with John Taylor who relayed the message to the
prophet; if Jo and Hyrum didn’t agree to be arrested on the morning of
June 23<sup>rd</sup>, he’d order out the militia to occupy Nauvoo until
they could be found. The previous night, Jo, Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith,
White-out Willard Richards, and Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell committed
to their fateful crossing of the Mississippi under the cover of night,
where they planned on camping for a few days until horses and provisions
could be prepared for their journey to the Great Salt Lake to build the
new Zion away from all law enforcement. The Mormons would follow close
behind and begin their mass migration to the north corner of Mexico that
summer.

By running away from the Mormons at this crucial juncture in Jo’s life,
he abandoned them when they needed him the most. Yes, his life was in
danger, but cowardice is most often revealed when the consequences are
dire. Jo sent a message to each and every one of the 15-20,000 Mormons
living in Nauvoo and Illinois at large that night that he valued his own
life more than he valued theirs. No true leader worthy of adulation
would abandon his people in the throes of a coming war like this.
Further, without leadership, what would the Nauvoo Legion do when Ford’s
Illinois militia attempted to enter the city and occupy it? Would the
Legion see this as aggression and answer with aggression, thus kicking
off the war and setting Nauvoo under siege? Or, would they give
themselves over to Governor Ford who was the rightful commander in chief
here, whose authority supersedes that of a simple mayor’s?

The posse of 30 men to arrest Jo and Hyrum entered the city of Nauvoo at
8 a.m. on June 23<sup>rd</sup>, expecting the fugitives to follow the
orders of the Governor of Illinois. The arrest couldn’t be affected and
they would have to return to Carthage empty-handed, leaving one officer
by the name of Yates in Nauvoo to watch any fishy behavior and keep an
eye out for the fugitives. However, it wasn’t quite that simple, which
is what we’re discussing today.

Events on June 23<sup>rd</sup> transpired quickly and it’s easy to get
lost in attempts to sequence them. As always, I’ll do my best but it was
a busy and chaotic day in Nauvoo history. First off, by 9 a.m., the
posse had been in Nauvoo roughly an hour, talking with the citizens,
asking around to find Jo and his friends, all of the posse members
keeping an eye on their collective backs in case of immediate
insurrection. They were hostiles in a foreign land; these men were
enemies of the prophet and the people believed the rhetoric that the men
were there to kill the prophet or at least escort him to a place where
he’d be vulnerable to assassinate. It was clearly tense in the city.
After conversing with the arresting posse for some time, John M.
Bernhisel, who visited Governor Ford with John Taylor the previous day,
crossed the river with Reynolds Cahoon, another trusted advisor of the
prophet, to visit Jo, Hyrum, and White-out Willard in hiding near
Montrose Iowa. They went there to “ma\[k\]e some explanations respecting
Governor Ford’s letter.” What did they say? We can only speculate.
However, I would wager a guess that Cahoon and Bernhisel told Jo that
just because he ran away didn’t mean the Illinois militia wouldn’t enter
and occupy the city until the fugitives were found.

These men conversed for quite some time while the arresting posse
remained in Nauvoo for a few more hours. During that time, they spoke
with Alpheus Cutler and Henry G. Sherwood about the situation.

> \[T\]he officer in command exhorted Alpheus Cutler and Henry G.
> Sherwood to have Joseph and Hyrum come back, as the safety of Nauvoo
> depended on it. He pledged himself that their lives should be
> protected.

Could Jo and Hyrum be protected? Was this man’s pledge for protection
enough to convince them to come out of hiding? These 30 men were
hand-picked by Governor Ford to carry out this mission; they were likely
the most-trusted contingent of the militia force in Carthage. If Ford
sensed any of them may take an opportunity to execute vigilante justice,
they wouldn’t have been there in the first place. Somehow, the men were
convincing enough to the Mormon leadership in Nauvoo that Jo and Hyrum
would be protected.

> Cutler was satisfied with this pledge and said it could be depended
> upon, as he was an old acquaintance of his; and agreed to use his
> influence to fetch them back. They went and informed Emma, who
> requested them to go to Joseph and Hyrum and say that unless they
> returned and went to Carthage, Nauvoo would be burnt up and the people
> massacred.

She was right. Emma’s refusal to go with the Phelps family to D.C. and
meet with President John Tyler and petition again for redress synergizes
with this statement perfectly. There was the eventual danger of the
Nauvoo Charter being revoked and her husband’s life being in danger, but
the immediate threat was far more pressing. Honey, I know you’re worried
about dying, but if you run away we’re all dead. Emma had her priorities
straight here and she was obviously weighing her options in the growing
conflict. It wasn’t just Emma who was considering the larger
implications of the state militia entering Nauvoo, some of Jo’s closest
allies were similarly fearful, although for reasons beyond the human
cost.

About 11 a.m., the posse had mounted their animals to return to
Carthage,

I would add here, where they would communicate Joseph’s insurrection to
Governor Ford and he would order out the militia, but the HoC continues.

> when Hiram Kimball laid his hand on Reynolds Cahoon’s shoulder and
> said, “there must be something done in this matter immediately, or our

Sure, Nauvoo citizens will probably be massacred like Emma said, think
what that’ll do to our property values\! We gotta get those guys to
surrender or we’re gunna lose our butts on city real estate\!

> Kimball then called the officer aside and promised if he would wait
> until 2 p.m., they would go over the river and try to persuade Joseph
> and Hyrum to come back. Upon that promise the posse dismounted, and
> the animals were ordered back to the stable.

Hiram Kimball bought them another few hours to make a decision.
Messengers were sent up the Mississippi to William Jordan’s farm where
Jo, Hyrum, and White-out Willard were hiding, to convey the events of
the morning and push them to just surrender and everything will be okay.

There were other considerations beyond the person and property value
which would be lost once the Illinois militia entered the city.

> in great agitation and said to Cahoon, “something must be done. We
> must get those men back or we shall all be destroyed. I must have some

Yes, this excitement had begun by the destruction of a rival printing
press in the city, now members of the leadership were concerned about
their own Nauvoo Neighbor/Times and Seasons printing press meeting a
similar fate. I don’t know if this technically qualifies as irony but it
sure is sweet to the taste.

While in hiding, Jo, Hyrum, and Willard Richards were taking all these
meetings from people telling them they need to come back and just
surrender. Hiram Kimball had bought them until 2 p.m. before the posse
would return to Carthage, which, because information traveled at the
speed of a horse, bought them another 12 hours before the Illinois
militia would descend on the city. By 1 p.m. it was do or die.

Flour… right. All three of these guys have been awake for nearing 32
hours by this point. Now, when Pistol Packin’ Porter arrived at William
Jordan’s farm with Reynolds Cahoon to persuade Jo to come back, this is
an iconic moment in Mormon history. It’s also a moment used as
ammunition against Emma Hale Smith Bidamon for over a century and a half
to come. This is the moment when Jo and Hyrum had this monumental
conversation with Port after they’d crossed the Mississippi for Mexico,
but decided to go like lambs to the slaughter. Here it is.

> the Lord is in it; if we live or have to die, we will be reconciled to

Emma pushed Jo to come back with the letter. I can’t find the actual
letter but the content of what Port told Jo has served as what Emma
communicated to Jo through Port, when the shepherd ran from the flock,
he left the sheep to be devoured. This conversation lives in infamy in
believing Mormon circles because if Jo didn’t listen to Emma, he would
never have been interred in Carthage and therefore never assassinated;
American history would look significantly different. But, Jo listened to
what Emma said through Pistol Packin’ Porter, asked his older brother,
Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff, what to do, and they all agreed to give themselves
up and see the thing out. Jo told Hyrum that they’d be butchered, but
Hyrum apparently believed in Jo’s god more than Jo because he said we’ll
be alright, the Lord is in it. We will be reconciled to our fate.
Indeed, they were reconciled to their fate. They were now on a path to
suffer the consequences of their own actions.

There was a problem though. Hiram Kimball got the arresting posse to
stick around until 2 p.m. before they returned to Carthage empty-handed
and Governor Ford ordered out the militia to occupy Nauvoo. This
conversation transpired over that deadline, meaning they wouldn’t be
back in Nauvoo until the posse was already nearly back in Carthage. They
missed the deadline, and immediate action was required to keep Governor
Ford from marching a thousand soldiers into Nauvoo that night or the
following morning. Jo drafted a letter to Ford and sent it via express
messengers Theodore Turley and Jedediah M. Grant, who would be known as
Brigham’s Sledgehammer in Utah. Here’s the letter:

> His Excellency Thomas Ford:--
> 
> Sir:--I wrote you a long communication at 12 last night, expressive of
> my views of your Excellency’s communication of yesterday. I thought
> your letter rather severe, but one of my friends has just come to me
> with an explanation from the captain of your posse, which softened the
> subject matter of your communication, and gives us greater assurance
> of protection, and that your Excellency has succeeded in bringing in
> subjection the spirits which surround your Excellency to some extent.
> And I declare again, the only objection I ever had or ever made to a
> trial by my country at any time, was what I have made in my last
> letter—on account of assassins, and the reason I have to fear deathly
> consequences from their hands.
> 
> But from the explanation, I now offer to come to you at Carthage on
> the morrow, as early as shall be convenient for your posse to escort

> 
> We will meet your posse, if this letter is satisfactory (if not,

> the proceedings, although we may want time for counsel.
> 
> We remain most respectfully,
> 
> Your Excellency’s humble servants,
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH
> 
> HYRUM SMITH

So began the coverup. Jo and Hyrum ran from the law, they were convinced
to surrender and go to court, now they needed to contrive the necessary
excuses to the powers that be to keep from the militia marching into
Nauvoo because of the missed deadline. It was all a misunderstanding
from Ford’s previous letter, no need to bring in the militia, we’ll meet
you on the mound tomorrow afternoon. The excuse given, that Jo feared
for his life, is legitimate. He was in danger of assassination, but that
doesn’t necessarily excuse ignoring an arrest warrant, especially when
his life was in danger for the very things he was supposed to be
arrested for. However, Jo was smart enough to realize that with
everybody telling him to just surrender and with the assurance from
Henry G. Sherwood that the arresting posse would effectively defend him
from assassination, he made a judgement call. See this out, escape from
jail or be released, whichever was most prudent, then organize the next
Mormon exodus to the Great Basin. Trying to make the journey west with
so much pressure on Nauvoo was ill-advised and poorly timed. But if the
Mormons could have a few months to prepare while Jo and Hyrum were tied
up in court, the next exodus could be executed less hasty and more
effectively, likely retaining a larger percentage of the members during
the move.

It is notable, however that Jo seemed to be acting completely defeated.
In the city council meeting before he decided to run he acted defeated
before he came up with the plan to flee west, but this sense of defeat
was different.

> About four o’clock, p.m., Joseph, Hyrum, the Doctor, and others
> started back; while walking towards the river Joseph fell behind with
> O.P. Rockwell; the others shouted to him to come on; Joseph replied,
> “it is of no use to hurry, for we are going back to be slaughtered,”
> and continually expressed himself that he would like to get the people
> once more together, and talk to them tonight. Rockwell said if that
> was his wish he would get the people together, and he could talk to
> them by starlight.

Jo wanted one final address to the Mormons as he likely felt his
previous message about going to the west and raising a more righteous
people might not sit well as his final sermon before all these legal
troubles. But there was a problem. Yates, the guy the arresting posse
left behind, was still in Nauvoo and waiting to arrest Jo and Hyrum as
soon as they publicly showed their faces. Besides, Yates and the
arresting posse were still operating under the assumption that Jo and
Hyrum had fled and they’d need to bring the militia into Nauvoo the
following day. By the time Jo and his cabal of acolytes were entering
crossing back over the Mississippi, the arresting posse would be riding
into Carthage to inform Governor Ford of Jo’s insurrection by refusal to
surrender. Governor Ford would resolve to call out the militia and if
they entered the city the next morning and learned Jo had preached a
sermon the previous evening, it would be an act of insurrection so
blatant that it would further inflame the anti-Mormons among the militia
to the point that violence couldn’t be prevented. You do have to admire
Pistol Packin’ Porter’s resolve to follow the prophet and his childhood
friend here. If you want to preach, I’ll get everybody together and you
can talk to them by starlight. He was a murderer, but at least he was a
loyal murderer.

Preaching by starlight was a bad idea though. It would leave the prophet
vulnerable to anybody in the city who wanted to either arrest or kill
him on the spot. When Jo arrived in Nauvoo that evening after crossing
back over the Mississippi, he understood the gravity of the situation by
spending time with the few people on earth he actually did care about.

> It was the strong persuasions of Reynolds Cahoon, Lorenzo D. Wasson,
> and Hiram Kimball, who were carrying out Emma’s instructions, that
> induced Joseph and Hyrum to start back to Nauvoo. They re-crossed the
> river at half-past five; when they arrived at his Mansion in Nauvoo,
> Joseph’s family surrounded him, and he tarried there all night, giving
> up the idea of preaching to the Saints by starlight.

The sun was going down and shadows cast further across the city. The
arresting posse were certainly back in Carthage by this point. It was
hoped that Theodore Turley and Jedediah Grant would arrive in Carthage
to deliver Jo’s surrender letter to Governor Ford before nightfall,
thereby abating the mustering of the militia to march on Nauvoo that
evening. They’d also be able to observe what was going on in Carthage
and report it to Joseph the following day upon their return. Awake for
over 36 hours by this point, Jo settled into the Nauvoo Mansion where he
crashed and allowed the next day’s events to hit him like a freight
train upon waking.

While he slept, Turley and Grant made it to Carthage with Jo’s letter of
surrender as the stars began to peek through the firmament.

> Col Turley, and Elder Jedediah M. Grant,… carried it to Carthage,
> where they arrived about 9 p.m. They gave the letter to Governor Ford,
> who first agreed to send a posse to escort Gen. Smith in safety to
> Carthage;

There was a problem, however. Governor Ford had a few little demons on
his shoulders who voiced dissent for the escort of the General Joseph
Smith to Carthage.

> send, or allow an escort to go with Joseph, as he said it was an honor
> not given to any other citizen.

This is an interesting point. We need to keep in mind that Jo was trying
the patience of Governor Ford here. The previous letter Ford sent to Jo,
which Jo replied by saying we’ve done nothing wrong, stated that Jo was
to surrender that morning and that if any witnesses were required
Governor Ford would subpoena them accordingly. Also, no escort as that
will only cause the Carthaginians to lose their minds. Now, 13 hours
after the deadline for surrender and Governor Ford’s hand was called. To
remain true to his first letter to Jo he was required to call out the
militia to invade Nauvoo and affect the arrest. Now, in this letter from
Jo, he surrendered on his own terms, claimed he was bringing his
witnesses anyway in defiance of Ford’s previous letter, and Jo wanted
his own escort but assured Governor Ford that they would escort him
“without the show of a great armed force to produce excitement in the
minds of the timid.” Ford had absolutely no reason to honor Jo’s
requests here as they were in stark contradiction to his own terms. He
was the governor and Joseph Smith was an inferior military officer, Ford
called the shots here. It was very gracious of him to even allow the
messengers to deliver the letter without detaining them as leverage to
insure the prophet’s surrender. Ford had absolutely no obligation to
conform his conduct to the wishes of Joseph Smith; Jo had worn out his
welcome before Ford even arrived in Carthage 2 days prior. Ford also had
a point; if Joseph Smith were any other citizen, let alone any other
officer in any state-sanctioned militia, Jo would never be granted any
of these wishes. Ford had absolute grounds to hold a court martial of
Joseph Smith in absentia and rule him guilty of treason, after which
Ford had legal grounds to march the Carthage militia into Nauvoo and
execute both Joseph and Hyrum in broad daylight. He had legal grounds to
conduct the proceedings this way and the fact that he didn’t proves he
wasn’t the rabid anti-Mormon like Colonel Levi Williams who just wanted
the prophet dead. Governor Ford was doing everything in his power from
keeping this from spiraling out of control, which includes ignoring the
requirements of martial conduct for officers who commit acts of treason.
With Governor Ford’s patience wearing thin, he concluded the meeting
with Jo’s bois, Turley and Grant, by telling them to get out of here and
tell your commanding officer that he better be in Carthage by 10
tomorrow morning or I’ll call out the militia as I promised I’d do 13
hours ago if Jo didn’t surrender. He sent them packing with this final
dire message to carry back to the prophet.

> He would not allow the messengers to stay in Carthage through the
> night, but ordered them to start at 10 o’clock and return to Nauvoo
> with orders for Gen. Smith to be in Carthage by 10 o’clock tomorrow
> morning without an escort, and he threatened that if Gen. Smith did

> the Governor.

Turley and Grant arrived in Nauvoo as daylight was near breaking on June
24<sup>th</sup> to deliver the message of immediacy to Jo who probably
slept like a rock that night after having not slept the previous night.
They woke him up upon their arrival and notified him that his previous
letter to Governor Ford stating he’d be at the mound near 2 p.m. wasn’t
good enough; Governor Ford demanded Jo be in Carthage by 10. Jo sent a
few letters demanding Horace Hugins and Joseph R. Wakefield to meet him
in Carthage the next day at noon to provide legal counsel. He signed
each letter with “Do not fail me, and oblige your old friend.” Jo got
his posse together of all the men who were charged with the original
Expositor destruction and riot.

> Monday, 24.—Francis M. Higbee having sworn out a writ before \[Judge\]
> Thomas Morrison, a justice of the peace at Carthage, on the

This wasn’t an armed guard or a posse to protect the prophet, these were
the 18 fugitives named in the original arrest warrant Jo had refused to
honor when Constable Bettisworth entered Nauvoo and placed him under
arrest which led to the 2 sham trials in the Nauvoo Municipal Court. The
others, White-out Willard, Henry Sherwood, Alfred Randall, James Davis,
Cyrus Wheelock, A.C. Hodge, and several other brethren, however, were
the bodyguards of the prophet, joining him on the journey to Carthage in
outright defiance of Governor Ford’s orders. Each of them were likely
armed as well, which would only exacerbate the excitement of the
Carthaginians on their arrival.

They began the journey out of Nauvoo, but not before Jo could take a
wistful moment of reflection when he caught sight of the temple.

> Joseph paused when the got to the Temple, and looked with admiration
> first on that and then on the city, and remarked, “This is the
> loveliest place and the best people under the heavens; little do they
> know the trials that await them.” As he passed out of the city he
> called on Daniel H. Wells, Esq., who was unwell, and on parting he
> said, “Squire Wells, I wish you to cherish my memory, and not think me
> the worst man in the world either.”

That is a rather revealing passage as Daniel Wells was the justice who
presided over the 2 sham trails in the Nauvoo Municipal Court. What
conversation transpired between Jo and Wells previously which would
cause Jo to say that to him? Jo and Daniel Wells had an interesting
relationship which is also quite notable because he wasn’t a member of
the church at this time. It wouldn’t be until after the battle of
Nauvoo, during which Daniel Wells served as a lieutenant and defended
the city and harbored refugees that he was baptized, after which he went
with the Mormons out to Utah, served as a Mayor of Salt Lake City,
Attorney General of the State of Deseret, he dedicated the St. George
Temple, and was a loyal dog to Bloody Brigham during the construction of
the Mormon empire in Utah territory. I suppose I’m merely surprised that
Jo considered Wells’ opinion of him so highly that he would give those
parting words before heading to his certain death at Carthage.

After Jo saw the temple and wistfully commented about it and the
Mormons, talked briefly to Daniel H. Wells, the men set off, possibly as
many as fifty of them leaving Nauvoo, probably with most of them armed.

> At 10 mins. to 10 a.m., they arrived at Albert G. Fellows’ farm, 4
> miles west of Carthage, where they met Captain Dunn, with a company of
> about sixty mounted militia, on seeing which Joseph said, “Do not be
> alarmed, brethren, for they cannot do more to you than the enemies of
> truth did to the ancient saints—they can only kill the body.” The
> company made a halt, when Joseph, Hyrum, and several others went into
> Fellows’ house with Captain Dunn, who presented an order from Governor
> Ford for all the *“State arms*” in possession of the Nauvoo Legion,
> which Joseph immediately countersigned.

This was a good move from Governor Ford. The Nauvoo Legion was a
significant threat. If he could neuter them by taking away at least some
portion of their guns, that threat is reduced. The people will still
have their own personal arms, nothing could force them to give those up,
but the arms owned by the state could be revoked at any time. So, the
order came from Captain Dunn, no friend of the Mormons, and Jo
countersigned. Now Captain Dunn could take that signed order into Nauvoo
and all 3,500 Legionnaires would be forced to surrender their arms to
state custody.

But, with tensions so high, an Illinois militia officer entering the
city and demanding unilateral disarmament of the Nauvoo Legion could
only excite the tensions even more. Even if this Captain Dunn carried
the order signed by Governor Ford and Joseph Smith personally, would the
people trust that he was acting under proper authority? Would they think
the signature of Joseph Smith was actually a forgery and that Captain
Dunn was just disarming them to make an attack of the city more
favorable for his Illinois militia troops? Plus, Jo had agreed to
Governor Ford’s directive to be arrested at 10 a.m. just a few miles
from where this meeting took place. If the Mormons perceived Captain
Dunn’s disarmament order as an act of aggression and responded likewise,
Nauvoo would be missing its commander in chief in the very moment the
Illinois-Mormon war kicked into action. It was a bit of a conundrum,
here is the solution.

Let me go ahead and answer that for you Jo, yes. Yes, you are being
detained and you agreed with the GOVERNOR OF THE STATE to be arrested at
this exact moment. You are very much expected to be arrested and
Governor Ford was showing a great deal of leniency in not calling out
the militia immediately upon your first refusal to be arrested when you
fled across the Mississippi. But, instead, Jo asked one of his trusted
sycophants for the answer.

> Sherwood answered “No”; when Joseph directed him to return ahead of

Jo directed Sherwood to carry out the order. He was defeated. Opposing
this order would be yet one more act of aggression that would result in
the state militia entering Nauvoo. His hands were tied and all he could
do was acquiesce to the request. But, Jo did take the opportunity to
grandstand a bit in another iconic quote in Mormon history.

Yeah, he could see himself as innocent if he was a narcissistic
sociopath, which I think there’s plenty of evidence for. He was not
innocent of the crimes against the state and the American constitution.
However, his blood did cry from the ground for vengeance and he was
indeed murdered, or assassinated if you prefer, but it was clearly the
result of hot blood that he’d personally boiled for half a decade. But
then, an interesting turn happens in this back and forth with Henry
Sherwood, Jo, and the Illinois militia officer, Captain Dunn.

> \[Joseph\] then said to Father Sherwood, “Go, and God bless you.”

So, we have Sherwood going with the order from Jo and the Governor to
collect the Legion’s arms and we have Jo’s legal counsel headed to
Carthage ahead of the company. But what about Jo and the arrested posse?
They made an interesting decision after a little commentary on the
perceived intention of the disarmament order.

Jo was already 30 hours overdue for the first arrest order, which was
served by the Governor because his defiance to acquiesce to the first
arrest warrant issued 13 days prior. The ultimatum if he didn’t
surrender was the state militia burning Nauvoo to the ground and he was
now finally only an hour late for the final notice Governor Ford gave
him when Jo was trying his patience, and here he resolved to return to
Nauvoo again, instead of continuing on to Carthage where he was expected
at 10 a.m. This decision was made around 1030-11, he was so overdue\!
How long could Governor Ford be expected to extend more leniency when he
was surrounded by over a thousand people who wanted nothing more than to
march into Nauvoo with rifles over their shoulders? Jo going with
Captain Dunn back to Nauvoo to execute the disarmament order was
absolutely unnecessary and only ran out an already extinguished clock by
more hours. Jo and the Mormons were on borrowed time and Jo decided to
mortgage even more time he didn’t have to assist Captain Dunn. I can’t
stress this enough, this action was not necessary. Jonathan Dunham was
the acting Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion. If he walked into Nauvoo
with a signed order from Governor Ford and Joseph Smith telling the
Legion to give up their arms, they would comply or they’d be in defiance
to their own two commanders-in-chief, at which point the state militia
would be forced to put Nauvoo under siege until the Legion surrendered.

Most importantly, Jo going back to Nauvoo on the 24<sup>th</sup> was
terrible optics. Governor Ford and the thousand Carthage militiamen were
expecting him on the outskirts of the city by 10 a.m. and he was already
late and still 4 miles out. It would take another hour or two for
intelligence to reach Carthage that Jo had turned back with Captain
Dunn, at which point the riled up militiamen in Carthage wouldn’t see
Joseph Smith and his arrested posse riding into town, but a single
messenger. They would lose their minds at yet another overt act of
insurrection and the cries to Governor Ford to call the militia into
Nauvoo would reach a fever pitch. In some ways, Jo was testing Governor
Ford and how serious Ford was about calling out the militia here. Jo may
have been completely defeated here, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have
leverage. Until he was in cuffs behind bars, Jo’s bargaining chip was
himself and he was able to make a display of that fact by turning back
for Nauvoo instead of walking into Carthage where he was expected.

Jo didn’t, however, just leave Governor Ford high-and-dry. Jo sent his
legal counsel, Esq. Woods, into Carthage with this letter for Governor
Ford.

> Dear Sir:--On my way to Carthage to answer your request, this morning,
> I here met Capt. Dunn, who has here made known to me your order to
> surrender the State arms in possession of the Nauvoo Legion, which
> command I shall comply with, and that the same may be done properly
> without trouble to the State, I shall return with Capt. Dunn to
> Nauvoo, see that the arms are put into his possession, and shall then
> return to headquarters in his company, when I shall most cheerfully
> submit to any requisition of the Governor of our State.
> 
> With all due respect to your Excellency, I remain
> 
> Your obedient servant,
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH

Jo also sent acting Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion, Jonathan Dunham,
ahead of himself with an extra order beyond the order from Governor Ford
in his hand.

> To Major-Gen. Jonathan Dunham and all commissioned and
> non-commissioned officers and privates of the Nauvoo Legion:--
> 
> You are hereby ordered to comply strictly, and without delay, with the
> within order of the Commander-in-Chief, Governor Thomas Ford.
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH,
> 
> Lieut.-Gen. Nauvoo Legion

Notably, Jonathan Dunham was also one of the 18 offenders arrested on
the original charges of riot. He was just as guilty as Jo and Hyrum in
this posse of arrested folks at this very moment, but this order from Jo
apparently superseded the arrest order from Governor Ford. What this all
amounted to was chaos. For a few short hours, nobody knew what was going
on. The militia and Governor Ford expected Jo had again defied the
arrest order. The citizens of Nauvoo expected Jo to be martyred in cold
blood when he left the city at 630 that morning and a siege of the city
to immediately follow. All those plans and expectations are out the
window because Jo does what Jo wants.

Joseph and his company then returned with Capt. Dunn, and arrived in
Nauvoo at 2 ½ p.m…

When the fact of the order for the State arms was known in Nauvoo, many
of the brethren looked upon it as another preparation for a Missouri
massacre; nevertheless, as Joseph requested that it should be complied
with, they very unwillingly gave up the arms.

All the state arms were gathered and interred in the Masonic Hall,
begrudgingly, by the members of the Nauvoo Legion. This is a super
important detail. These were the state arms originally supplied to the
Nauvoo Legion because John C. Wreck-it Bennett was quartermaster general
of the state of Illinois before he was named Major-General of the
Legion. They retained those arms, many of them holdovers from the
revolutionary war and in disrepair, until this order was complied with.
However, there were still everybody’s personal guns that couldn’t be
legally seized because America the second amendment is bonkers. While
the citizens were officially disarmed, the remaining Nauvoo Legionnaires
were far from defenseless and arguably the guns in their private
possession, although less in number, were more modern and likely better
maintained and more reliable in a battle. While these arms were given
up, it was crazy to assume that the Nauvoo Legion didn’t still massively
overpower and outgun any militia Thomas Ford could muster. Governor Ford
knew this. Joseph Smith knew this. The anti-Mormons in the Illinois
militia knew this. The Legion was still incredibly dangerous and a
massive threat even if the militia was just using this as a pretense to
make a more effective attack on the city.

While this was going on in Nauvoo, Hyrum sent one member of the posse
with Jo’s legal counsel, Esq. Woods, into Carthage to see what was going
on.

> Hyrum said to Abram C. Hodge, “You go into Carthage, and see what is
> going on, and hear what is said on this matter.”…

Hodge wasn’t wrong. The Carthage Greys were one division of the state
militia comprising about 150-200 men. You could easily remove 150-200
men from the Nauvoo Legion and not even realize they were missing.
That’s about 5% of the total Legion numbers. As I talked about last
episode, by any and every calculus, even with their state-provided arms
seized, the Nauvoo Legion wins every encounter against any militia
Governor Ford could gather.

Another detail worth noting here, Governor Ford officially disbanded the
Nauvoo Legion in reaction to the martial law declaration in Nauvoo. But
just because the Governor says you’re no longer an official militia,
those men don’t forget their training and get rid of their guns and
uniforms. It did mean, however, that if any contingency of the Legion
mustered for any reason they’d be treated as a rebellion and dealt with
accordingly. Ford was doing literally everything in his power to keep
that from happening. This fact is noticed by the compilers of the
History of the Church.

> It appears that Governor Ford feared that the Nauvoo Legion, although
> disbanded, might avenge any outrage that might hereafter be committed

However, the compiler, George A. Smith, didn’t stop there. He provides
his own commentary for Ford’s motivations here which I believe are
drastically misplaced.

There are a few ways to look at this. Governor Ford didn’t disarm the
Legion so that his militia could burn the city down unopposed, he did it
to stop from violence breaking out in the first place and if violence
did break out it would be easier to arrest. But beyond that, it wasn’t
so much what the Legion had done that was feared by Governor Ford and
the officers of the state militia, it was much more about what they were
capable of. When Jo was arrested in Dixon, Illinois back in June 1843,
just a year ago from our timeline, it was his Nauvoo Legion who rode out
of the city and rescued him by placing the officers who arrested Jo
under the arrest of the Legion. Those men, Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds,
barely escaped Nauvoo with their lives. What was to ensure that the
Nauvoo Legion wouldn’t act similarly as soon as this arresting posse had
Jo in their custody again? Additionally, if Ford decided to disarm the
state militia in addition to the Nauvoo Legion, the state militia lacked
the organization and centralized command and geography the Legion had,
meaning they’d be at an incredible disadvantage if reduced to their own
private arms when violence broke out. The men in the Illinois militia
came from all over Adams and Hancock Counties, cities multiple days’
journey away from each other. If any disorganization took place, the
consequences were dire and intelligence travelling at the speed of a
horse was always a hindrance. The Legion, however, all lived in the same
city; all of their private arms were in people’s houses just blocks away
from each other. If Ford decided to disarm everybody, the Mormons would
make very short work of any unarmed militia attempting to enforce the
law or directives of the Governor. Disbanding and disarming the Legion
was clearly the most prudent course for Governor Ford, even if the
Mormons collectively groaned under the order and suspected it as the
beginning of the conspiracy to burn the city to ashes.

The order was carried out. All the Nauvoo Legion’s arms were
consolidated at the Masonic Lodge and put into the possession of Captain
Dunn under the orders of Governor Ford. Now the posse could finally
return to Carthage to comply with the original arrest warrant that was
nearing 2 weeks old by this point.

But, of course, some more tearful good-byes were in order.

He’s not wrong, there was no alternative. But, if a militia is operating
at the direction of the Governor, it is by definition a lawful militia,
not a lawless mob. I know that’s a pointless quibble, but the Mormon
persecution narrative is replete through every single page and it needs
to be called out for the lies which spawn and nurse it.

Okay Jo, we get it. Lamb to the slaughter. Butchered. Calm as a summer’s
morning. He was setting himself up as a martyr even though he was
clearly unwilling to die and only forced into state custody when
continuing to flaunt the law meant total war and massacre of himself and
his people.

They received this intel from Hodge and he obviously wasn’t wrong in
hindsight. But the options were, not go another step further and declare
war against the state of Illinois, or go a step further and face the
law, thus preserving the lives of 15-20,000 Mormons in and around
Nauvoo. However, after Hodge told this to them, another messenger
appeared with two letters for the prophet from Carthage.

Requests for documents and insurance that he would be safe. With these
final assurances in place, the posse continued towards Carthage.

Finally, after defying the original arrest warrant for a few hours shy
of 2 weeks, running from Governor Ford’s enforcement of the arrest
warrant for 40 hours, and delaying another 12 hours beyond Ford’s
gracious extensions to the arrest warrant, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith,
and their posse were in Carthage 5 minutes before June 25<sup>th</sup>.
Understandably, they were greeted by all those who’d been expecting them
in the city for 40 hours by this point with some derision and
excitement.

Of course they were rejoicing, they’d finally captured public enemy \#1,
a fugitive from justice for over 4 years who’d been abusing their
generosity and good natures for the same amount of time. But there’s a
much larger force at work here and it’s a sword that cuts both ways.
Dehumanization. To the citizens of Carthage and the gathered militia
camped in the city, Joseph Smith was a heaven-daring wretch, a demon in
human form, a blasphemer, a knave, the most diabolical and black-hearted
monster the world had seen since the reign of Napoleon. For the Mormons,
these men cheering at the arrest of Joseph Smith were the adversary.
They were mindless mobocrats seeking to destroy the kingdom of god and
oppose the Lord’s righteous designs for building the promised land.
These people were oppressing and persecuting the Mormons every step of
the way and they were motivated by the same spirit that left 18 Mormons
dead covered in bullet holes in a sawmill back in Missouri. This isn’t
just a bunch of drunken idiots in the 1840s… this is us. This is human
and this is how we treat our enemies. We can look at this behavior and
discuss how irrational everybody here was acting, but who wouldn’t act
exactly the same way watching video of the president being removed from
the white house in handcuffs, or the previous president for that matter,
it depends on where you fall on this asinine bipolar political spectrum
we’ve become the victims of. It takes a cool head to act rationally
amidst this much excitement and chaos between these warring tribes. The
trouble is, the coolest head is the quietest voice in the room. In this
case, the coolest head was Governor Ford and he was dealing with over a
thousand drunk men at midnight seeing their sworn enemy ride into town
with only a posse of 18 other men who were also guilty and equally their
enemies and those men were incredibly vulnerable to vigilante justice.
At no other point in Jo’s entire life had he been so vulnerable than the
night of June 24<sup>th</sup> 1844 riding into Carthage 5 minutes to
midnight. Governor Ford immediately tried to calm the emotions and get
people to withhold their celebratory lynching and just go to bed
already.

For Governor Ford to be able to thwart a lynching that quickly amidst
this much chaos and excitement is truly an expression of how universally
respected he was. In many ways, Joseph Smith entering Carthage and
surrendering to arrest was a massive victory for Governor Ford. He’d
effectively brought a fugitive into state custody while avoiding what
seemed at many points to be an inevitable civil war. The confusion of
the past two days made his job exponentially harder but he still kept
his cool and his ability with a few words to quiet a mob of a thousand
drunk men itching for murder and send them all to bed is a remarkable
display of power. What it reveals further is that Ford really had the
rule of law and the interests of the state in mind, not the interests of
the respective parties. He didn’t take sides in the conflict, he merely
acted as umpire and the players agreed that his calls were the law. But,
this was one small victory of one small battle, the war was still ahead
for Governor Ford.

To make tensions even worse, Hamilton’s hotel was bursting at the seams
and it was the only place in Carthage where people could sleep out of
the elements.

Of course Ford reacted with indifference to this because he’s been
listening to hundreds of dudes talking about that nonstop for 3 days
since he arrived in Carthage\! In fact, everything he did was to keep
those musing from becoming a reality. He couldn’t stop people from
conspiring against Jo, he could only thwart the plan once it was put
into effect. He was a Governor, not a god. Besides, Governor Ford was an
elected official and he had to balance his actions with the desires of
his constituents while also not appearing a complete fool or partisan to
his political opponents. Could he retain control of the situation with
these enemy tribes quartering in the same city? Could the peace be
maintained?

As much as this was a purely legal issue, politics couldn’t be
disentangled from the public fury and personal motivations of
politicians and saboteurs can never be underestimated in public
conflicts like this. Ford could only act within the confines the
situation and his office dictated, which was most often counter to what
the people wanted. The confusion caused by Jo agreeing to surrender,
then reneging, then agreeing at a later time, then finally coming into
Carthage on his own terms obviously inflamed Ford’s closest advisors
during this conflict. He reflects on the past two days with a sense of
despair and exhaustion in his History of Illinois. This portion I’m
going to read basically summarizes everything discussed in today’s show.

It’s a good thing they didn’t stick around too long cuz Jo wasn’t coming
into town until late that evening anyway. He continues:

It was all a plan. The constable never wanted Jo to come with him to
Carthage that morning, he wanted Jo to not be arrested and force
Governor Ford to call the militia into Nauvoo. It was all a ruse to give
them an excuse to burn Nauvoo to the ground. The circle of people
Governor Ford thought he could trust in this brewing conflict was
growing smaller. He acted the only way he could, by waiting to see Jo’s
next move.

Then Ford tells us about why he elected to seize the state arms of the
Nauvoo Legion, which led to even more confusion and feelings of
persecution on the part of the Mormons, especially because one of Ford’s
informants was Wilson Law, one of the publishers of the Expositor and
one of the 8 greatest public enemies of the prophet.

Yeah, he removed the state arms from the Nauvoo Legion for their own
protection. We can never forget what fueled the Mormons and anti-Mormons
alike in this conflict; the impending Mormon revolution. As much as it
motivated fealty for the Mormons, it motivated the anti-Mormons to
oppose everything the Mormons did, no matter how benign it may be.
Joseph Smith was a revolutionary of religious supremacy; he didn’t
belong in America in the 1840s and those around him who didn’t see a
Mormon theocracy as a good thing were hyper-sensitive to the gluttony of
the Mormon empire. The Mormons having 30 cannons and six thousand guns
supplied by the state of Illinois to kick off the Mormon revolution was
a terrifying prospect, even though the numbers were inflated by
misrepresentation. It was the concept the people feared, not the scale
of the concept. At the end of the day, Jo’s present situation was the
result of his own tyrannical and revolutionary tendencies; his own
actions caused his arrest and confinement in Carthage. The fury between
the Mormons and anti-Mormons were a product of Joseph Smith and the
controversy he inevitably caused by trying to fabricate a world that was
impossible and choosing to live in that world regardless of what 1840s
America actually was. It was up to the victims of his quest for conquest
to clean up his messes and the threats on the lives of 15-20,000 Mormons
in Nauvoo were the result.

In all of this, it’s clear to me that the one saving grace in all of
this rising conflict was Governor Ford. If he didn’t have his head on
straight and devolved to the partisanship and tribalism that seemed to
govern the actions of everybody around him, war was it. There was no
other option. The Mormons and anti-Mormons would have waged all-out war
and who knows how American history would have been shaped from that time
forward. Anybody else handling this situation would have made one false
step somewhere and the consequences would have been dire. Governor
Ford’s only real mistake in this conflict was not having a large
enough force guarding Jo and Hyrum in Carthage on June 27<sup>th</sup>,
otherwise he handled this conflict the way we hope any elected official
would handle a crisis of this proportion.

Look, Governor Ford could have handled this the way the Mormon
propaganda portrayed him as handling it. He could have done what
Governor Lilburn Boggs did in the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838. He could
have marched Joseph and Hyrum into the public square of Nauvoo, held a
court martial and ruled them as treasonous while officers of a
state-sanctioned militia. Their actions absolutely merited this
iron-fisted response. He could have marched his militia straight into
Nauvoo, set the city ablaze for rebellion, signed an extermination order
and declared the Mormons enemies of the state and they’d spend the rest
of 1844 moving to the Great Basin. Then, a couple years later Governor
Ford would be reading by firelight in his study and a shotgun blast
would rip through his window and kill him just like almost happened with
Governor Boggs. Ford could have handled this the way military law and
the constitution required, marshalled together thousands of militiamen
from nearby states who would have been happy to help the Illinois
militias in uprooting and terrorizing the Mormons. It was perfectly in
line with the laws of the time for Governor Ford to treat this rebellion
like it was and quash the Mormon movement within the boundaries of the
United States. It would have made him immensely popular in Illinois and
he’d go on to run for reelection, or senate, or maybe even aim for a
cabinet position.

He did none of those things because he wasn’t a partisan hack and wasn’t
seeking personal glory or aggrandizement, even though many of the people
at the center of this controversy were only in it for those reasons.

Society rarely looks back fondly on tyrants. Joseph Smith exhibited
tendencies people in a pluralistic and democratic society can’t help but
fear or loathe. He was the problem here. Anybody who views Joseph Smith
with pity or as the victim in all of this only does so through motivated
reasoning. History is replete with examples of men just like him rising
to power, bucking trends, building empires, overthrowing governments and
casting populations into the throes of uncertainty and chaos, often
meeting their demise in tragic and violent ways. A person can’t pull all
the levers and push all the boundaries in a society without expecting
violent pushback. That’s what Jo did and the pushback he received was
the due process of law that he deserved. Even still, millions of people
today see this as persecution. Here’s a fun exercise, if anybody ever
says that what happened in Carthage was the result of religious
persecution, ask them: should Joseph Smith be subject to kings, rulers,
magistrates in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law like his
articles of faith dictate? If the answer to that is yes then you have
grounds to say that he should have been court martialed in Nauvoo and
executed by Governor Ford for treason and inciting rebellion. If the
answer to that question is no, well, then, we have a much larger problem
on our hands because the implication there is that the law of god is
superior to the law of the land; that there are circumstances where
people should follow their god instead of their laws. As soon as that
becomes acceptable, the devolution into Christian theocracy is nearly
complete.
