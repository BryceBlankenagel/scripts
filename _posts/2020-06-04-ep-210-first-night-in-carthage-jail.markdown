Ep 210 – First Night in Carthage Jail

On this episode, Jo and company spend their first entire day in the city
of Carthage, one of the twin cities of anti-Mormonism. Governor Ford
does his best to keep the peace and does so by marching Jo and Hyrum
down the line of the various militias in Carthage shaking hands and
providing proper introductions as “Generals Smith”. The Carthage Greys
commit a brief bit of mutiny before Governor Ford brings them under
control. Jo tells Ford about the vulnerability of Nauvoo with the
Prophet’s absence and Ford elects to send a trusted advisor to Nauvoo to
guard against a vigilante mob descending on the city and burning it to
ash. Charges of treason are filed against Joseph Smith and his older
brother, Hyrum Smith, for declaring martial law in Nauvoo to shut down
riots across the city. A hearing takes place in Carthage to determine if
there is enough evidence for the circuit court at Carthage to pursue
criminal convictions on the initial charges of riot. 16 of the arrested
city councilors are released on bail and the hearing is scheduled for
June 29<sup>th</sup> when the state and defense attorneys can call
witnesses and collect evidence. After most of them head for Nauvoo that
afternoon, Jo and Hyrum are arrested and interred in Carthage Jail for
their own protection. Jo and friends spend the night “laid promiscuously
on the floor”.

Joseph Smith has been here before. He’s brought a state to the edge of
all out civil war before. He’s been charged with treason and conspiracy
to murder before. He’s been in jail before. He’s undergone a court
martial which sentenced him to death before. He’s resisted the will of
state militias commanded by state’s governors before. He’s riled up his
followers into a frenzy befitting a revolution before. He’s been
arrested for being a criminal kingpin before after surrendering to
prevent total war. Everything that happened in Nauvoo happened before in
Missouri. But the scale was far larger and the stakes far higher.

After Jo had repeatedly defied an arrest warrant for over 2 weeks’ time,
he and his 17 co-conspirators who caused the Expositor to be destroyed
were finally in Carthage, surrendering to the Illinois-state legal
system. They arrived the night of June 24<sup>th</sup>, 5 minutes before
midnight, to a crowd of howling anti-Mormons who considered this
surrender the first battle victory in the larger impending
Illinois-Mormon war.

The people in Carthage at this time considered Joseph Smith and his
criminal friends to be the greatest enemies to the peace and tranquility
of their lives. Before the Mormons started arriving in 1839, everything
was just peachy. Then, thousands of refugees streamed into the state to
take advantage of Illinois hospitality and things haven’t been the same
since. The Mormons were terrible neighbors having rager parties late
into the night and finally the neighbors got the cops to shut down the
party.

Now, the initial charges which landed Jo, Hyrum, and their 16 city
councilmen in state custody were simply inciting riot from the
destruction of the Expositor. There would be other charges worked out by
the state prosecutor in the coming trial, including destruction of
property, abuse of power, 1<sup>st</sup> amendment violations, and so
forth, but the charge of riot for now would at least get them in jail
and before Judge Morrison.

Now, Judge Morrison had sworn out the first arrest warrant the day after
the Expositor was destroyed, that’s June 11<sup>th</sup>, based on
charges filed by Francis M. Higbee for because they “commit a riot,…
wherein they with force and violence broke into the Printing Office…,
and unlawfully, and with force burned and destroyed the printing press,
type, and fixtures of the same,”. When constable Bettisworth arrested Jo
with that warrant, Jo held his sham trials in Nauvoo, chaired by Daniel
H. Wells, and he was discharged on all the alleged crimes. The Nauvoo
Court refused to hear testimony of those who suffered the crime. It
produced witnesses who said whatever Jo needed them to say. It came to
the conclusion it started with before the hearing was even called, that
Joseph Smith couldn’t possibly have committed a crime in destroying a
rival religion’s paper.

Governor Ford was no idiot and he considered the Nauvoo Municipal Court
hearings to be a farce, thereby considering the original arrest warrant
issued by Judge Morrison, still unserved. As Jo’s posse of 18 guilty men
descended into Carthage, with a small armed escort, Constable
Bettisworth presented Judge Morrison’s original arrest warrant to the
men, and “the prisoners voluntarily surrendered themselves to the
constable”. Voluntarily is such a loaded term here because after
everything we’ve discussed the past 7 episodes has been a series of
events calculated by Jo to never surrender. Only when the specter of
total war and another Mormon extermination became inevitable did Jo
finally wave the white flag. In many ways, it wouldn’t be crazy to think
that his continued flaunting of the law after the Expositor was
destroyed made the central issues and the anti-Mormon outrage
exponentially worse. If he’d just surrendered to the first arrest
warrant the Governor wouldn’t be handling this issue personally, the
state militias never would have been called out, Jo would have fought
through the legal system and probably been able to appeal the issue to
the state supreme court after this hypothetical Carthage hearing would
have convicted him. But, he’d still be alive and the Mormon settlement
wouldn’t be under the threat of state militias marching into the city
and burning Mormon homes to the ground.

My point, Jo didn’t voluntarily surrender; he was forced into it like
every other surrender. He’d done everything in his power to resist
arrest, including declaring martial law, but no officer pinned him to
the ground until he died.

Governor Thomas Ford was doing his best to handle this issue. He didn’t
really have many options available to him. He knew a court hearing in
Carthage would cause a riot one way or another based on the outcome. If
Jo was guilty, the Mormons might very well march their militia into
Carthage to break him out and lay the city to waste. If he was
discharged the anti-Mormons would never let him leave the city alive.
What was Governor Ford to do? An argument could be made that he should
have transported them all to Springfield and held the hearing there away
from all the pro and anti-Mormon sentiments which gripped the local
communities. Ford talks about this in his History of Illinois p. 349

Yeah, the conflict itself is what kept Governor Ford from removing the
matter to a place where the conflict wasn’t raging. He was sure that if
he left at any point the Mormons and anti-Mormons would immediately go
to war, even with Jo and Hyrum in his custody. How would that look on
his career as governor? He was properly stuck and didn’t have any other
option than to handle the matter domestically without making a single
false step that would excite conflict even more.

He further added, reflecting on the situation, that his hands were not
only tied by the fury raging all around him, but by the legal system
itself.

> Some persons have supposed that I ought to have had them sent to some
> distant and friendly part of the State, for confinement and trial; and
> that I ought to have searched them for concealed arms; but these

> and jailer, under the direction of the justice of the peace. And also

Ford was there to enforce the laws, not to make special exceptions to
the laws because of extraordinary circumstances. All he could do was
promise the safety of the prisoners and as impartial of a trial as
possible.

> they should have a fair and impartial trial.

Jo, Hyrum, and the 16 other conspirators spent the night of June
24<sup>th</sup>-25<sup>th</sup> in Hamilton’s hotel, filled to the brim
with people who wanted each other dead, including some of the printers
of the Expositor as well as Joseph H. Jackson. When they awoke “At 8
a.m., President Smith had an interview with William G. Flood of Quincy…;
while in conversation with him Constable Bettisworth arrested Joseph for
treason against the State of Illinois.”

This was a new development. They were there in Carthage having
surrendered to Judge Morrison’s original arrest warrant based on riot,
but treason is a slightly greater offense than riot and Jo didn’t have
an underground bunker to hide in while he turned out the lights of the
Nauvoo Mansion. So what’s this treason charge about? The History of the
Church includes the underlying complaints which led to the treason
charges, given by Augustine Spencer. A little refresher on this guy,
Augustine Spence opposed the power of the Mormon empire in Nauvoo and
then got in a fight with his younger brother, Orson Spencer, a Jo crony.
Jo took this matter personally and issued an arrest warrant for Augustin
Spencer. When Spencer refused to be arrested by Nauvoo marshal John P.
Greene, Jo and Greene attempted to get Charles and Robert Foster to help
them affect the arrest, after which Charles Foster pointed a pistol at
the chest of Joseph Smith before the gun was wrestled from his hand
either by Jo, Robert D. Bob-the-Builder Foster, or Pistol Packin’ Porter
Rockwell; the accounts conflict as to who knocked the gun out of
Charles’s hands. Well, Augustine Spencer was a domestic enemy of the
church and once all the men in this conflict were arrested and he was
discharged he fled to Carthage, the main safehaven for dissenters of the
church, which is why the Expositor printers and Joseph H. Jackson were
staying there. All of that is back on episode 197 about the Fosters if
you need a refresher.

This is the complaint by Augustine Spencer about treason for which Jo
was arrested while already in state custody for the charges of riot.

> Whereas complaint has been made… upon the oath of Augustine Spencer,
> that Joseph Smith,… on or about the nineteenth day of June… 1844…
> \[did\] commit the crime of treason against the government and people
> of the State of Illinois…
> 
> These are therefore to command you to take the said Joseph Smith, if
> he be found in your county, or if he shall have fled, that you pursue
> after the said Joseph Smith into another county within this State, and
> take and safely keep the said Joseph Smith, so that you have his body
> forthwith before me to answer the said complaint, and be further dealt
> with according to law.

Another complaint was filed by Henry O. Norton, another faithful member
who’d been in deep conflict with the church for the past 2 years.

> complaint has been made… upon the oath of Henry \[O.\] Norton, that
> one Hyrum Smith,… did on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of June, 1844 commit
> the crime of treason against the Government and people of the State of
> Illinois…

In addition to the charges of riot, now Hyrum and Jo specifically were
charged with treason on complaints of Augustine Spencer and Henry O.
Norton, two defectors from the church. This was purely as a result of
them declaring martial law in Nauvoo and arresting people who protested
their power. They did this without the approval of the
commander-in-chief of the Illinois militias, Governor Ford, and thereby
committed treason and infringed on people’s rights to peaceful assembly.
This is reasonable as it was the presence of the Nauvoo Legion and the
city police force during the destruction of the Expositor which caused
the riots in the first place. They destroyed that printing press with
force and the people in the city protested. Then when the criminal
responsible for the press’s destruction and the ensuing riot discharged
themselves from their own criminal court, the people became even more
enraged to the point that it was unsafe for Jo and Hyrum in Nauvoo. They
declared martial law for their own safety alone so they could commit
crimes with impunity. Nauvoo policed itself but who polices that
policing? The citizens of Nauvoo groaned under these draconian measures
which is why one of the first things Governor Ford did upon his arrival
was force Jo to rescind the martial law declaration, disband the Nauvoo
Legion, and seize the Legion’s weapons. While the Nauvoo Legion had
begun as a state-sanctioned militia, the way it had been used for the 4
years of its existence was to enforce an Orwellian system of absolute
tyranny. The charges of riot may be dismissed based on the evidence
produced by Jo’s two sham hearings in Nauvoo, but the charges of treason
required a greater attention to evidence and fact-finding that would
understandably tie up Jo and Hyrum in jails and court for months to come
and certainly result in the revocation of the Nauvoo Charter. Revoking
the Nauvoo Charter to stop corruption was one of the primary advocations
in the Expositor which led to its destruction to begin with. When the
fascists make it illegal or impossible to oppose their power, who will
be left to oppose them? Oh… wait… that’s kind of the point isn’t it?
Thanks uncle Mark for that little gem. Check out How to Heretic episode
140 for a troubling rundown of Mormon secret societies and their history
of draconianism.

I digress, back to the story. When Jo’s posse entered Carthage 5 minutes
before midnight, the people wanted a view of the prophet, many of them
unable to recognize him because he didn’t have 81 million followers on
Twitter. Governor Ford was able to assuage the infuriated mob by telling
them he’d organize a public gathering the following morning for them all
to see the prophet and fiend in the flesh.

All 18 men were in custody of the state and Jo and Hyrum had the
additional charges of treason on their rap sheet.

This passage strains credulity. Governor Ford was doing everything in
his power to keep the 1300 militiamen in Carthage from exacting
vigilante justice. His parading Jo and the other prisoners through the
town square in front of all the militiamen wasn’t to rile them up, they
were already sufficiently riled up. It was most likely done to put a
human face on the demon these people imagined Jo to be for the past 4
years. His speech of 20 to 30 minutes this morning isn’t recorded
anywhere I could find but I’m pretty comfortable in stating that
whatever he said was to calm the tensions, not exacerbate them.

Beyond that, his actions immediately following the speech provide a
window into just how much deference Ford was showing to the prisoners.
Instead of simply locking them up and letting whatever happens happen,
he kept Jo and Hyrum out in the public to talk to the people of the
community under guard to keep from vigilante justice from happening.

But he did end up granting private conversation with Jo, just not yet.
It’s not that he refused to hold a private meeting with Jo, it was that
this wasn’t the right time. Other more important issues needed to be
dealt with first.

Why did he Governor Ford walk Jo and Hyrum up and down the lines of the
Carthage Greys and the other companies of the Illinois militia? To
literally get the men to shake hands and meet face to face. When two
groups of people have so thoroughly demonized each other, the only way
to make headway to combat those deep human tendencies is to make
dramatic efforts to force each side to see the other as human. Jo and
Hyrum were powerless to do anything here. The militia in Carthage, under
the command of Governor Ford, held the lives of the prophet and
patriarch in their hands. Any false move resulting in Jo or Hyrum being
hurt would immediately bring the Nauvoo Legion marching into Carthage
before nightfall. Governor Ford made each of these guys literally shake
the hands of their enemies. When our enemies change from a concept to a
person with a face, we act more human toward each other. Shaking hands
or kneeling in solidarity goes a lot further in reducing tensions than
firing rubber bullets while masked in combat gear.

Governor Ford had no real assurance, other than the force of his vested
authority, that one of these men wouldn’t crack a shot off at Jo or
Hyrum as he forced the men to shake hands. He was taking a massive risk
with this display but the payoff may assuage a civil war from
assassinations so the reward was worth the risk in his mind. As they
were making this pass in front of the Carthage Greys and the McDonough
troops, among all the other militiamen, Jo pulled Ford to the side and
apparently voiced some concern over Ford’s plan to introduce Jo and
Hyrum to everybody.

> Joseph had a conversation with the Governor for about 10 minutes, when

Jo, ever the coward, didn’t think it was a good idea. But, Governor
Ford’s deportment was solemn and reassuring enough that Jo continued
walking down the line. Then, the group got to the platoon of Carthage
Greys, the antagonists of all these events in Carthage, if Jo could be
considered our protagonist.

> The Carthage Greys refused to receive them by that introduction, and
> some of the officers threw up their hats, drew their swords, and said

Try to picture this. Jo and Hyrum are prisoners of the state and
Governor Ford is walking them down the line of Illinois militiamen and
telling them, “alright boys… shake hands. I know you don’t like each
other but shake hands or nobody gets their apple juice.” Then they get
to the Carthage Greys who refuse and act all blustery and macho by
drawing their swords and talking a big game. Here’s what happened next.

Whatever Governor Ford actually said there it was written in the history
of the church as foreshadowing 2 days ahead. Regardless of what the HoC
says Ford said, he was able to calm everybody down even though they
didn’t want to shake hands and the day continued on. Of all the folks
caught up in this tension, the person I’d most like to meet and share a
dirty whiskey with is Governor Ford. He was able to keep a mob of over a
thousand people from killing their public enemies \#1 & 2 when Jo and
Hyrum were essentially unarmed in handcuffs. We can’t stop cops today
from killing people in that scenario in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, but
Governor Ford kept 19<sup>th</sup>-century drunken mobocrats from
killing the men in their custody.

Jo was obviously very worried about what was going on in Nauvoo during
his absence. A lot of people who’d been dealing with his poor leadership
for years just read in the Nauvoo Expositor that Jo was a tyrant with
dozens of wives among him and his closest friends. For many Nauvoo
citizens, the Mormonism described in the Expositor was not the religion
or god they believed in and now the leadership whose faults were
highlighted in the Expositor destroyed the press to silence those
critical voices. But, the damage was done. The insurrection wasn’t just
the printers of the Expositor, hundreds or thousands of Nauvoo members
were questioning their decisions and religious convictions. Now, Jo,
Hyrum, and most of the city council were locked in jail facing charges
of riot after an overtly tyrannical act. Jo’s grasp on the people was
slipping, yes, but there was also a greater danger and that was the
threat of confusion and other state militias working under direction of
themselves instead of Governor Ford. Now that the highest-ranking
commanding officers of the Nauvoo Legion were in state custody and the
Legion itself was disbanded by order of the Governor, Nauvoo was a
sitting duck for its enemies. Any vigilante mob with misdirected anger
wanted to exact revenge on the Mormons at large, instead of just the
leadership who was responsible for their woes, could make short work of
invading the city and wreaking chaos on people they believed to be their
enemies. Jo was understandably stressed, not only about the safety of
the Mormons, but about the safety of his throne upon his eventual return
to the kingdom; he petitioned Governor Ford multiple times during these
morning exercises and meet-n-greets for a conversation to tell him that
a militia was needed in Nauvoo.

>

Were the Higbee, Fosters, and Laws actually headed to Nauvoo to plunder?
They’d be stopped immediately if they were trying to plunder property
but what if they were trying to plunder souls? Look, William Law was
designated the president of the True Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints when it was formed one month ago in May 1844. William
Law had called his own quorum of apostles, his own bishop and, more
importantly, called the Nauvoo church leadership to repentance and told
members they could join the True Church with their preaching license
granted by Jo’s church. That was one of the primary reasons the
Expositor was so quickly dealt with. It was a paper not just printed as
an expose of the Nauvoo leadership, but also as the foundational press
for the rival church the printers had formed. You silence a press, you
silence a movement and with Jo’s absence ringing through the streets of
Nauvoo the True Church led by the much less controversial William Law
was an appealing proposition to many members who were sick of the
constant outrage. The growth of the True Church in the face of Jo’s
Church would be completely unopposed with Jo and his cronies locked up
or across the nation preaching and electioneering for him.

Governor Ford heard the pleas of Jo and Hyrum that Nauvoo was in danger
without them there. Ford had also removed the Nauvoo Legion’s arms
provided by the state, leaving them understandably defenseless should
any rival state militia march into the town. This conversation between
Jo and Ford was consequential enough that even he reported about his
response; which was conducted in the way a good Governor and
Commander-in-chief should act given the circumstances.

Bear arms and a well-regulated militia; it turns out the state clawing
back the arms they provided to the Nauvoo Legion didn’t do much good
because the Mormons were independently armed to the teeth already and no
order from any Governor would seize their private guns no matter how
great a threat they were cuz ‘Murica. I assume Jo calculated that the
presence of the militia there would allow him to retain power in
absentia while he and his most powerful elites were nowhere near the
city. The Fosters, Higbees, and Laws were still in Carthage but word of
their return to Nauvoo was assuaged by the Brown county militia heading
to Nauvoo, likely arriving about the same time the dissenters would. The
militia would aid the city police, who were still loyal to Jo, in
putting down any gatherings of people and if groups couldn’t be
dispersed they’d emplace a curfew to send people home and tear gas those
who didn’t disperse.

Now that Nauvoo was sorted out by request from Jo to Governor Ford, some
other more immediate troubles arose in Carthage, the Carthage Greys.
These guys had refused to shake Jo’s and Hyrum’s hands when Ford was
walking the men down the line. They were just too haughty and prideful
to see their enemy as anything other than inhuman.

The McDonough county militia could be better relied on than the Carthage
Greys by sheer virtue of the respective militia compositions. The
Carthage Greys were made up of citizens of Carthage, one of the twin
cities that comprise the hotbed of anti-Mormonism, the other being
Warsaw where Thomas Coke Sharp published his openly anti-Mormon paper
the Warsaw Signal. The McDonough boys, however, were in the next county
east from Adams and Hancock county where all this rivalry was going on.
The citizens of McDonough County were far less affected by the Mormon
empire, whether that be with shady business practices and counterfeit
money or the Mormon political chess for the past 5 years. Simply put,
the Carthage Greys were anti-Mormons, the McDonough county militia were
there to support orders from Governor Ford, even though some of them had
friends in the Carthage Greys. No group before or since has been as
overtly anti-Mormon as the Carthage Greys. With them riled up into a
fury, Jo was forced to tell his bois to stay in the hotel, don’t go
downstairs and certainly don’t go outside or the Carthage Greys will
revolt from Governor Ford’s command. Ford was able to calm them down,
but would that last for the rest of the day? Would his ability to keep
the Carthage Greys calm last for the rest of the week?

Jo was getting constant intel while locked up in Hamilton’s Hotel
awaiting the trial of that afternoon.

> It was reported by Israel Barlow, that he had heard resolutions of the
> Warsaw troops read, to the effect that they would return to Warsaw at
> 3 p.m., then go to Golden’s Point on Thursday, and thence to Nauvoo.

This was crucial intel. These are Colonel Levi William’s boys. Levi
Williams is basically the anti-Mormon poster boy who’d later stand trial
for assassinating Jo and Hyrum. Intel that the Warsaw militia under Levi
Williams’s command was headed to Carthage was crucial and dire. It was
hoped that Singleton’s men would get to Nauvoo to command the disbanded
Legion and defend against Williams’s men if they made an attack on the
city, but could the men from Brown County in Singleton’s command be
trusted to not commit mutiny and simply join Levi Williams’s troops in
burning Nauvoo to ash? Singleton was trusted by Governor Ford but the
men he commanded were much harder to trust or control. As this intel
came to Jo from Israel Barlow, Jo took a number of meeting at the Hotel
without leaving for legitimate fear his life was in danger. In this
prison of sorts, he was something of a spectacle. Some of these
interactions are reported in the HoC, although the exact words exchanged
between Jo and his visitors are hard to nail down as this was all
recreated after the fact, meaning George A. Smith could make Jo however
he wanted him to sound for readers today.

Imagine having the audacity to bring an entire state to the brink of
civil war, surrendering to your enemies and being locked in essentially
a prison, and then telling your aggressors to their faces that they will
find blood and be fired upon by cannons from sources they don’t think
of. He has the arrogance to threaten their lives in this moment? Imagine
if an unarmed black man with an officer pointing a gun at him told the
officer that he will witness scenes of blood and sorrow for thirsting
for the man’s blood. The cop would probably shoot him if he didn’t
already as soon as the man mentioned a cannon the officer can’t see. I
digress but the point remains that Jo wasn’t trying to calm the fury of
the people, he was playing into the us vs. them mentality. He had
manufactured an empire that benefitted from war if he could make it out
alive. He was acting aggressively while surrounded by his enemies in a
city of people who wanted him dead and his aggression here proves that
he thought he’d get out of all this alive. Well, Jo, you stoke the fires
of war, everybody gets burned.

Sometime before, during, or after these visits, Jo wrote to Pistol
Packin’ Porter and his first wife, Emma. The letter to Emma survives,
the message to Port was probably verbal and never written because Port
was illiterate. A lot is revealed in these messages though. First the
letter to Emma after Jo had a considerably longer conversation with
Governor Ford:

> Dear Emma:--I have had an interview with Gov. Ford, and he treats us
> honorably. Myself and Hyrum have been again arrested for treason,
> because we called out the Nauvoo Legion; but when the truth comes out,

> JOSEPH SMITH

Jo wrote this letter too hastily. First off, the Governor did treat Jo
and Hyrum with respect and appropriately when he marched the two of them
down the line of Carthage militiamen and had everybody shake hands.
Introducing them as Generals was also appropriate and obviously carried
considerable weight for all of these militiamen who were colonels,
majors, privates, and the like. Ford did agree to send Captain
Singleton’s Brown County militia to aid the Nauvoo Police in keeping
the peace. However, Jo’s third point after his interview with Ford is a
bit more questionable. Apparently Ford had agreed that the prisoners
would receive bail after the forthcoming hearing, which we’ll get into
in a minute here, and Ford would bring Jo and Hyrum to Nauvoo under
armed escort for their bail with the understanding that they’d appear at
the coming hearing, which ended up being scheduled for June
29<sup>th</sup>. Like I said, we’ll get into it in a minute. It is
notable, however, that after the hearing, Jo and Hyrum were deemed to
high-risk to be released on bail. They had plenty of resources but they
were obviously a flight risk. Jo and Hyrum had done nothing to gain the
confidence of the legal system and Governor Ford here; the Carthage
Court had absolutely no assurance that they’d return to Carthage once
released on bail, so they were interred in the city jail after this
hearing. What is particularly notable about this is Jo probably had the
agreement from Ford that he’d return to Nauvoo on bail and therefore
felt comfortable acting aggressively toward his visitors. If Ford told
him he’d be back in Nauvoo by the following day, he’d once again be
surrounded by his Legion and a veritable army of his sycophants and he'd
break the state of Illinois into war after refusing to return to fulfill
his bail. This is all hypothetical obviously because Jo did leave that
jail while still alive but it was out a window into a courtyard with 150
men who immediately killed him.

Now, the message to Pistol Packin’ Porter Rockwell which was probably
never written, just transmitted orally by the same messenger who carried
the message to Emma.

> Joseph also sent a message to Orrin P. Rockwell not to come to
> Carthage, but to stay in Nauvoo, and not to suffer himself to be
> delivered into the hands of his enemies, or to be taken a prisoner by

Port, don’t come to Carthage\! This is further evidence to me that Jo
fully expected to return to Nauvoo within two days’ time. Port was quite
well-known in Carthage. When John C. Wreck-it Bennett had been
excommunicated from the church and began collecting affidavits and
making public allegations that Porter Rockwell pulled the trigger on
Governor Lilburn Boggs in Missouri, Port confronted Bennett in Carthage
where he was hiding out from the Danites. Because this was in public and
Bennett was smart enough to never be alone when the Danites were hunting
him, Bennett and Port got in a fight at one of the taverns there in
Carthage. The people removed Port from the inn and chased him out of the
city, after which Port went into hiding and traveled across Illinois to
Indiana where he hid for months before being apprehended on his return
trip to Nauvoo and spending months in Missouri jails. All that to say,
the Carthaginians knew Port by his face and if he showed up in Carthage
they’d suspect he was up to no-good and who knows what would happen. Jo
telling Port to not come to Carthage here was protection for Port and
protection from the city exploding into chaos while it teetered on the
precipice of doing so with Jo locked up in Hamilton’s Hotel.

Now, to the hearing. This is essentially titled an “examination” of Jo
and the other 17 defendants who were charged for riot. The only record I
can find of it comes from White-out Willard Richards who hastily
scratched the proceedings in his journal as it took place, doing his
best at shorthand. You’ll find a link in the show notes.

First I’ll read the introduction to the hearing in Richard’s notes from
the Joseph Smith Papers as it illuminates why we’re going to struggle
through it.

That’s the brief overview so let’s dive into this fateful hearing.
First, I’ll describe the battlefield. Notably, the prosecuting attorney
on behalf of Hancock County here was Chauncey L. Higbee, one of the
primary antagonists of the church and Joseph Smith as well as one of the
7 printers of the Expositor. Apparently, there wasn’t enough of a
conflict of interest for him to recuse himself from this hearing. This
is one of the first errors of this hearing. The attorneys on the defense
side for Jo and his boys were James Woods and Hugh T. Reid. Interesting
to have James Woods defending a criminally insane tyrant in 1844 as well
as 2018\! History is circular.

And that was the entire hearing. You see why I read the introduction
from the Joseph Smith Papers because it accurately describes how hastily
it was written and how the people attending knew what was going on, but
us reading the record in hindsight have to make guesses and assumptions
based on what White-out Willard Richards wrote. Regardless, the
conclusion is clear, the offenders were released on bail totaling $7,500
or just over $250k in 2020 money. However, this hearing was on the
charges of riot for the 18 involved individuals including Jo, Hyrum, and
the various city councilors who passed the resolution declaring the
Expositor a public nuisance and destroyed the press. The charges of
treason against Jo and Hyrum specifically were still active and required
a separate hearing. Also worth noting, this hearing wasn’t an actual
jury trial. It was considered an investigation like the November 1838
court of inquiry. It was conducted to determine whether there was enough
evidence to charge the offenders with the stated crimes and begin an
investigation. The 16 men were released on bail which means there was
enough evidence to charge them and they would be held over for that $250
grand if they didn’t appear for the subsequent jury trial which was
scheduled for June 29. The state had to gather evidence and material
witnesses who weren’t present during this investigation so it was
postponed until that date of June 29<sup>th</sup>. Jo and Hyrum,
however, being charged with treason, wasn’t at issue or under
investigation here. They would be held in Carthage Jail for treason.

Governor Ford reflects on this hearing.

> On the 23<sup>rd</sup> or 24<sup>th</sup> day of June, Joe Smith, the
> mayor of Nauvoo, together with his brother Hiram and all the members
> of the council and all others demanded, came into Carthage and
> surrendered themselves prisoners to the constable, on the charge of

> charge. And all of them were discharged from custody except Joe and
> Hiram Smith, against whom the magistrate had issued a new writ, on a
> complaint of treason. They were immediately arrested by the constable
> on this charge, and retained in his custody to answer it.

After that, however, Ford discusses how the charge of treason was
calculated by the enemies of Jo and Hyrum. This taps into a legal
doctrine known as posse comitatus, a subject that’s been in the
headlines a bit recently. It is essentially the practice of a civil
officer, like a mayor or president, using the military as a police
force. The two divisions of law enforcement are supposed to remain
separate because police officers are supposed to live in the communities
which they police, while the military comes from anywhere and may not
know much about the area in which they are called to act as the police.
This posse comitatus was considered a problematic practice as was one of
the primary reasons Nauvoo formed a police force when they already had
the Nauvoo Legion. The Legion was supposed to be the well-regulated
state-sanctioned militia for armed conflicts. The police force is
supposed to be the dudes in blue who patrol the city and make sure
people are being good citizens. When the military is called in to do the
job of cops, you run the risk of a military-police state, which hearkens
back to the 4<sup>th</sup> amendment of the Constitution about
quartering soldiers. The federalists didn’t like that the commonwealth
considered occupying soldiers to be acceptable and the fourth amendment
was created to insulate citizens from a military-police force and to
discourage presidents from using military as their police force. It
wasn’t until after the civil war that the practice of posse comitatus
was outlawed as the Southern States were infuriated by Union soldiers
occupying them during the reconstruction era.

The charge of treason against Jo and Hyrum centered around this same
doctrine that a mayor or president can’t simply declare martial law and
engage in posse comitatus because he did something that was unpopular
with constituents. We start doing that, we slip further into a military
state and no haven of liberty America claims to be can withstand the
acts of a tyrant using his military as the police.

Here’s Governor Ford’s commentary on the charge of treason against Jo
and Hyrum within the context of using the Nauvoo Legion as a posse
comitatus.

> The overt act of treason charged against them consisted in the alleged
> levying of war against the State by declaring martial law in Nauvoo,

Yes, without the rising conflict between Carthage and Nauvoo for the
previous 4 years, it may have been determined in a court of law that Jo
and Hyrum had committed treason by their invocation of the posse
comitatus and martial law, but the charge seemed clearly to be a ploy to
get them locked in jail to exact vigilante justice. So, let’s talk about
the arrest after the hearing.

The charges for treason were filed and the prisoners were released on
bail after the hearing that afternoon. Jo and Hyrum returned to their
room in Hamilton’s Hotel. On the main floor of the hotel, Jo’s buddy,
Dan Jones, overheard a conversation between Wilson Law and Joseph H.
Jackson, two of Jo’s main antagonists.

What those eighteen charges were, we’ll never know. The thing is, many
of Jo’s actions were against the spirit of the law, but often not
necessarily against the letter of the law. He was a religious leader
while being the mayor of the city and commander-in-chief of the Nauvoo
Legion and he abused all three offices to create his Kingdom on the
Mississippi. This was a flagrant abuse of the wall of separation between
church and state but supreme court cases and the Lemon test we use today
to determine if certain laws or actions break that wall of separation
didn’t exist at the time, but that didn’t stop it from feeling wrong.
Other actions were less quantifiable but equally frustrating. Jo’s
coopting of the Nauvoo Municipal Court had sent case after case to the
circuit court at Carthage through the appeals process, but how does
somebody impeach and entire city’s court system for abuse of power? Was
calling out the Nauvoo Legion and declaring martial law actually
treason? It was certainly an abuse of power but determining if it
constituted treason was a bit more complicated. Besides, do you try
Joseph Smith as Mayor and keep everything in civil courts, or do you
throw the book at him by trying his conduct in court martials because he
was also the Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion? Other criminal
acts were much simpler, like harboring fugitives like Jeremiah Smith,
Jo’s distant cousin, who was running from the law on counterfeit and
theft charges. Jeremiah Smith was discharged via the Nauvoo Municipal
Court and he could claim double jeopardy if another court attempted to
try him but it was a sham hearing to begin with and the fact he found
refuge in Nauvoo was a criminal act by Joseph Smith of harboring a
fugitive from justice. Overall, the problem with Joseph Smith and the
1840s legal sphere is a problem we see in 2020. The wheels of justice
churn slowly but what happens when a criminal like Joseph Smith creates
a system of flagrant abuse of power and insulates himself from any legal
ramifications by appointing only his most loyal friends to jobs intended
to oversee his conduct and root out corruption? Add into this the
constant onslaught of propaganda and tribalism Jo spewed in public kept
the outrage machine running above capacity his entire life. He’s so
deeply poisoned the well of regular conduct of elected officials; he so
effectively crafted a reality for the Mormons where the world was
against them and anything negative about the divine leader was apostate
or gentile mobocrats attacking the gospel. Jo didn’t just hold up a
bible in front of a church, he wrote the bible, built the church, and
commanded the Army of Israel to destroy dissenting voices in the city.
Simply put, the structure of society we all agree to abide by couldn’t
handle the output of one mastermind criminal in Joseph Smith.

That being said, Jo and Hyrum were in Hamilton’s hotel after the hearing
which discharged the other 16 men on bond. They took dinner with the
Governor and talked with him for a while about what had transpired. He
took his leave from the engagement and Constable Bettisworth, the
original constable who’d tried to arrest Jo in Nauvoo immediately after
the Expositor was destroyed, served an arrest warrant on Jo and Hyrum.

Of course, Constable Bettisworth had the proper documentation to commit
Jo and Hyrum to Carthage jail based on the charges of treason filed by
Spencer and Norton. Jo doth protest too much.

Just because Jo doesn’t want to go to jail doesn’t mean the person
serving the legal process is committing “barefaced, illegal, and
tyrannical proceedings”. Arguably, the whole reason Jo was tangling with
the legal system right now was because of his own tyranny. Wait… that’s
not even arguable, that’s just the facts. This is a typical case of “I’m
not a tyrant, you are\!” “I didn’t collude with Russia, the democrats
did\!” Jo has reliably demonstrated his disdain for the law and it
doesn’t matter how much he and his older brother are remonstrating
against the due process of law, they would have to do what the cop says
or he’ll put them in a chokehold until they die. Wait… sorry, Jo and
Hyrum were white and their crimes were white-collar, that’s my mistake.
Besides, them going to Governor Ford to nullify the arrest warrant would
go against the entire reason he was there. Ford was only in Carthage the
ensure faithful execution of the law, not to interfere with it. They
were going to Carthage Jail and it didn’t matter how much they said they
can’t breathe. Wait… I forgot, they were just taken peacefully to jail
without any physical force even though the crimes they committed were
treason, not just accidentally using a counterfeit $20 bill.

George A. Smith spends a page in the History of the Church declaring how
illegal the mittimus was and decrying Governor Ford’s lack of action in
putting a stop to it. I won’t bore you with the propaganda because
frankly it’s all wrong and predicated on the idea that Jo and Hyrum
weren’t actually guilty of the crimes they very clearly committed.
However, when the mittimus was served, John Taylor, second prophet of
the Utah church, immediately burst into Governor Ford’s quarters and
demanded some answers. He’s the conversation according to John Taylor
after the fact.

> Elder John Taylor says, “As I was informed of this illegal proceeding,
> I went immediately to the Governor and informed him of it, whether he
> was apprized of it before or not, I do not know, \[(he was)\] but my

All John Taylor’s arguments against Governor Ford, everything George A.
Smith put in the History of the Church about how unlawful this arrest
was, is immediately nullified by the following paragraphs.

> As Esq. Woods \[Jo’s counsel\] went to the door he met Captain Dunn,
> with some 20 men, they having come to guard the prisoners to jail. Mr.
> Woods accompanied Governor Ford to (Captain) Justice Robert F. Smith,
> who gave as a cause for issuing the warrant of committal, that the
> prisoners were not personally safe at the hotel. Mr. Woods then
> requested the Governor to have a company of troops from some other
> county detailed to guard the jail.

Yeah, the reason they were taken to Carthage Jail was just as much for
their own protection as it was to prevent them from fleeing Carthage
under the cover of night. They even got their own security detail at the
direction of Governor Ford who would select only the most trusted of
soldiers to make sure vigilante justice wasn’t served while Jo and Hyrum
were there.

The company began the journey from Hamilton’s Hotel to Carthage Jail.

> Captain Dunn with his company escorted Joseph and Hyrum Smith from
> their lodgings, together with Willard Richards, John Taylor, John P.
> Greene, Stephen Markham, Dan Jones, John S. Fullmer, Dr. Southwick,
> and Lorenzo D. Wasson, to the jail. Markham had a very large hickory
> cane, which he called “the rascal-beater.” Dan Jones had a smaller

> keeping off the drunken rabble, who several times broke through the
> ranks.

Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Nauvoo city marshall John P. Greene, Dan
Jones (a Danite who ran a ferry on the Mississippi), John S. Fullmer
(what’s up Gazalem\!) Dr. Southwick (a Nauvoo city councilor), and
Lorenzo D. Wasson (another city councilman), were all locked up in
Carthage jail on the night of Tuesday, June 25<sup>th</sup>, 1844.
Initially they were placed in the dungeon but as the quarters were too
constrictive for all these men together, they were moved upstairs to the
debtor’s apartment “where the prisoners and their friends had amusing
conversations on various interesting subjects, which engaged them till
late.”

They also had a good ol-fashioned Kirtland-era style prayer meeting in
the cell that night.

> Prayer was offered, which made Carthage prison into the gate of heaven
> for a while. They laid promiscuously on the floor, where they all
> slept from ½ past 11 until 6 a.m. of the 26<sup>th</sup>.

One of these men wouldn’t leave the jail cell alive. One of them would
leave the jail cell by falling out a window, only to be repeatedly shot
upon his crumbling to the ground 2 stories below. One of these men would
leave on a stretcher, filled with bullet holes and missing a massive
chunk of flesh from his hip. Yet another would leave only having
sustained a small graze on the ear from another bullet. The rest would
leave long before that fateful 2 minutes of Mormon history. The overall
point remains that nobody left Carthage unscathed in one way or another.
In less than 48 hours, Mormonism would be tossed into the depths of
chaos and uncertainty, having just lost their prophet and patriarch.
