Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Willard Richards, John Taylor, and some of
their closest friends are now in Carthage jail. They spent the night of
June 25<sup>th</sup> to 26<sup>th</sup> supplicating with the lord until
late in the evening. There, they “made Carthage prison into the gate of
heaven for a while.” After which the men all “laid promiscuously on the
floor, where they slept”.

The morning of June 26<sup>th</sup>, these men all awoke tangled up in
each other with the town of Carthage hustling and bustling about. The
militia forces were over 1300 men by this point, many of whom came from
local towns who had a particular affinity for hating the Mormons, having
dealt with the criminal empire of Nauvoo for the past 5 years. This
means some of the highest-ranking leaders of Mormonism, including the
prophet and patriarch, Jo and Hyrum, were locked in a jail in hostile
territory, incarcerated for the purposes of their own protection.

The only insurance these incarcerated men had that vigilante justice
wouldn’t be served was Governor Ford. Ford’s presence during this
conflict had kept the region from spiraling into civil war so
effectively, but Ford was being fed a lot of false information
calculated to murder the Smiths and his circle of trusted militia
officers and advisors was shrinking every minute. The Carthage Greys
presented a particular problem here. They’d shown tendencies toward
violence and mutiny all along and Ford was having a really hard time
keeping them in line. They’d resisted his commands a few times, they
were the most excited when Jo and his posse entered the city on the
night of June 24<sup>th</sup>, they refused to acknowledge Jo and Hyrum
as Generals when Governor Ford was doing the meet and greet the morning
of the 25<sup>th</sup>. The Carthage Greys were the greatest existential
threat for the prisoners and Governor Ford knew it, the prisoners knew
it, Ford’s advisors probably knew it.

As Carthage began to hustle and bustle on this morning of June
26<sup>th</sup>, tensions were pretty high. Jo wanted a meeting with
Governor Ford. He must have thought all along that if he could just
explain himself and his actions the right way to Governor Ford, this
whole confusion would be resolved and he’d be allowed to return to
Nauvoo unharmed. In spite of what Jo thought, it doesn’t matter how you
explain criminal acts, they’re still criminal. However, there was a jury
trial coming up in Carthage to get the facts. All 18 city councilors had
been released on a collective $7,500 bail to return to Carthage on June
29<sup>th</sup> for the actual jury trial concerning their decision to
declare the Expositor a nuisance. Jo and Hyrum, however, were arrested
on extra charges of treason for declaring martial law, which would
require a separate criminal hearing. Governor Ford believed the charges
of treason would have been legitimate if they were brought in any other
place than Carthage, but also considered this extra charge as calculated
to make Jo vulnerable to vigilante justice. He was on high-alert.

For that matter, everybody was on high alert. At any point the Nauvoo
Legion could come marching into the city, lay waste to it, rescue their
prophet and commander in chief, thus setting off the Illinois-Mormon
war. Any of the rogue militias could commit mutiny and march into Nauvoo
and try their best to siege the city in an attempt to destroy it,
bringing out dozens of other militias from all over the state. Governor
Ford’s presence was the only thing keeping these tensions at simmering
instead of boiling over.

Jo wanted nothing more than for this case to be transferred out of the
circuit court at Carthage. Let’s make not mistake here, he was being
charged and held in jail by his enemies. He’d acquired those enemies
over the course of 5 years because he was a criminal kingpin, but they
absolutely were his enemies. He knew he had a better chance of a fair
trial, or at least a trial more favorable to him, if this was handled in
Quincy or taken to the state supreme court in Springfield.

> At 7 ½ \[a.m.\], Markham, Wasson and Jones were severally sent by
> Joseph with messages to the Governor; but at 8 got no return. He also
> sent word to his counsel, that he wanted a change of venue to Quincy,
> Adams county.

The crimes hadn’t been committed in Adams county and he wasn’t charged
in Adams county. The constable, the prosecuting attorney, the jailor,
even the Governor, had no legal basis to transfer the case unless they
could prove conflict of interest by the justice, by virtue of his being
a Carthage citizen. That could possibly be proven, but he wanted to
handle the case and therefore wouldn’t recuse himself and it would be a
separate legal battle to determine a conflict of interest. They would
also need to prove a conflict with the prosecuting attorney, which would
be easy because it was Chauncey Higbee, one of the printers of the
Expositor who’d personally been the victim of the alleged crimes.
Neither of these issues would actually be resolved, but that wasn’t
known at the time, which is why Jo was seeking the venue change to Adams
county.

When these messengers were sent to Ford, Jo and the other prisoners took
breakfast with the jailor, a guy named Mr. Stigall. They seemed to have
a lovely conversation.

> Joseph and Hyrum had a conversation with the Jailor, Mr. Stigall, who
> said a week last Wednesday, the mob were calculating to have made an

Calling for an army of thousands on only a fraction respond. Jo could
understand what that was like when he wanted 5,000 Mormons to join him
for the march to Missouri back in 1834 and only ended up with just over
200. It’s weird, a call to action but almost everybody is too lazy to
answer the call. Hmmm… wonder what that feels like.

Jo resolved to simply write a personal communication to Governor Ford
asking for a meeting.

> His Excellency Gov. Ford:--
> 
> Sir: I would again solicit your excellency for an interview, having
> been much disappointed the past evening. I hope you will not deny me
> this privilege any longer than your public duties shall absolutely
> require.
> 
> We have been committed under a false mittimus, and consequently the

> all things shall be made right, and we relieved from this
> imprisonment.
> 
> Your servant,
> 
> JOSEPH SMITH
> 
> P.S. Please send an answer per bearer.

And they sent the jailor, Mr. Stigall to Governor Ford with this message
in hand. A quick note, the mittimus was absolutely not illegal or false.
The charges of treason had been alleged by those who’d been unduly
burdened by the declaration of martial law in Nauvoo and the justice of
the peace was well within his power and merely complying with his legal
obligations to issue the mittimus. They were in Carthage on legitimate
charges and the mittimus was valid. This was either ignorance or lying
to try and get out of jail. One quick note as well… what would happen if
Jo was allowed to go free from Carthage by direction of Governor Ford.
Do you think he’d come back to Carthage to attend the criminal hearing?
Or, would he take the fact that he was imprisoned as the signal that
this time his legal troubles meant real business and raise the Nauvoo
Legion immediately upon his return to the city in order to carry out the
Illinois-Mormon war, which seemed nearly inevitable by this point? If
Governor Ford stepped in and nullified the mittimus, allowing Jo and
friends to go free, what assurance did he have that the law would be
complied with from that point forward? Keeping Jo in jail was the safest
thing for everybody at this point.

After that communication was sent to Ford, Piggy-bank Steve Markham and
Dan Jones returned from their meeting with Governor Ford, and this is
how it is reported in the HoC.

> Markham and Jones returned, stating that the Governor said he was
> taken by surprise last evening, and was very sorry; was afraid we
> would think he had forfeited his word about having an interview, that
> the wrath of the people was about to turn on the head of \[Joseph H.\]
> Jackson, the mob, \&c. That the Governor was doing as fast as he
> could.

Maybe it did catch him by surprise, maybe that was just the most prudent
thing to tell the messengers at that point in time. That word was
received at 830 in the morning and the jailor, Mr. Stigall, returned
with Ford’s written communication in response to Jo’s previous letter.

> The interview will take place at my earliest leisure today.
> 
> THOMAS FORD

With that communication, Jo knew he would have his conversation with the
Governor at some point this day. Then he could explain everything and
all problems would be dealt with. Immediately after receiving this from
Governor Ford, Hugh T. Reid, one of Jo’s legal counselors in the affair,
came to meet with the prisoners in the jail to discuss the case.

> Mr. Reid and others arrived at the jail, and investigated the merits
> of the case, and concluded to take a change of venue before Justice
> Greenleaf, of Augusta, Hancock co., and to send for…

And it lists 20 men as witnesses Reid was to send for in order to
testify on behalf of Jo and the Nauvoo City Council’s conduct concerning
the Expositor and the resulting protests and riots.

Finally, at 9:27 a.m., Governor Thomas Ford, with a personal advisor by
the name of Col. Geddes, arrived at the Carthage Jail to have this
long-awaited conversation with the prophet. We’re going to spend a lot
of time with the HoC and everything it reports was said during this
meeting. This was Jo’s chance to make his case to Governor Ford that he
shouldn’t be in Carthage Jail. This was his chance to muster every bit
of oratory power and persuasion he’d cultivated all 39 years of his life
to get out of just one more scrape with the law. It is reported as a
conversation and I’ll do my best to emulate how I picture this
interaction actually transpired by changing the pronouns to first-person
and making it a conversation instead of a report of a conversation from
a third-party observer who were John Taylor, John S. Fullmer, and
White-out Willard Richards in this case. I’ve done a little bit of
synthesizing the accounts into one cohesive conversation. Here it is,
from the Vogel HoC vol 6 beginning on page 660.

This is easily done away with by the simple fact that the Legion was
called out by martial law to oppose anybody in the city affecting an
arrest of Jo, Hyrum, and the other city councilors. This wasn’t done to
oppose a rival militia entering the city, but from vigilantes within the
city from affecting vigilante justice for the crimes committed by the
city council. Jo called out the Legion not to protect the citizens of
Nauvoo, but to protect himself and his closest friends after they’d
committed crimes and abused their power. Where Jo is lying is in his
intent, which is hard to prove in a court of law, let alone the script
of a podcast 180 years in the future, but I don’t see many of Jo’s
actions as being for the benefit of his followers when the benefit of
himself is sufficient to explain his actions. The conversation
continues:

What were the reasons for Governor Ford wanting to take the prisoners to
Nauvoo under the guard of his militia? All I can do is speculate but I
have an idea of what might have been running through his head. The
people of Nauvoo didn’t know what was happening in Carthage. Only the
previous day did 16 of the 18 charged men return to the city on bail and
who knows what they said to the other Mormons there. Plus, with those 16
back in Nauvoo and just Jo, Hyrum, and a few of their closest cronies
still in Carthage, danger was even higher that vigilante justice would
leave the smaller group dead. Governor Ford had heard so much from the
people who hated the Mormons, it would benefit everyone if he could go
to Nauvoo with Jo on his right hand to hear what was going on from the
mouths of the citizens themselves. Add into this, the mix of people in
Nauvoo represented a mix of desired outcomes. The majority of Mormons
believed the propaganda spewed by the leadership, that all of this was
the result of mobocrats and anti-Mormons; they all wanted their prophet
and patriarch back in the city to continue to lead the Mormon
revolution. But, there were also plenty who didn’t believe the
propaganda, who saw what happened for what it was, a corrupt city
government run as a theocracy who destroyed the printing press of a
rival church who called the leadership to repentance and the wider
church to reform. There were plenty who thought the rumors of polygamy
were disturbing and plentiful enough to maybe have some merit who read
the Expositor and had all those suspicions confirmed and were infuriated
by the revelations. Governor Ford coming to the city and showing those
folks that Jo was in custody and working through the proper legal means
would be a show of good faith in the legal system at large for these
folks who generally distrusted the corruption of Nauvoo. Beyond all of
that, Governor Ford taking Jo and Hyrum to Nauvoo in his custody, then
returning to Carthage with them still in custody would be a massive show
of force to the anti-Mormons who were waiting for Governor Ford to be
gone so they could kill Jo. If Ford could pull that off it would inspire
trust in the entire system and his office as Governor in the minds of
people who were running on the crank of fury and anger which motivated
many of their actions.

What would Jo and Hyrum do once in Nauvoo while in custody of Governor
Ford? That was another question entirely. The conversation continued.

Come on, Jo, couldn’t you foresee that would be a win for Satan calling
your own church “Mormon”. Apparently, the dude could only prophesy of
really vague stuff at undetermined times in the future instead of
anything consequential like the correct name of his own church.

Jo made his case to Governor Ford. He even had John P. Greene there to
confirm that nobody had been arrested during the martial law
declaration, which Governor Ford knew to be a lie as his previous letter
to Jo before Jo surrendered named 3 people who had been arrested and
demanded immediate release of them. This was Jo’s case that he didn’t do
anything wrong, and he had the documents, which showed the exact
criminality he denied, to back up his claim he didn’t do anything
criminal. Jo wanted this handled as a civil issue between himself and
the owners of the destroyed Expositor printing press, not as criminal on
charges of inciting riot from that destruction and treason for declaring
martial law. Jo also REALLY wanted the hearing before Daniel Wells in
Nauvoo to satisfy the legal demand to appear in court for the charges,
thereby granting him the right of double jeopardy by trying him again at
Carthage for the same crime. But, everybody involved knew that was a
sham trial and wouldn’t hold water. Here’s Governor Ford’s reply.

> \[The Governor\] referred to the trial before Esq. Wells, which did
> not satisfy the feelings of the people in and about Carthage. \[I

Governor Ford is careful and deliberate with his words here. The Nauvoo
councilors and Daniel Wells did act according to their best judgment,
but that judgment was clearly flawed. He even admitted that sufficient
time wasn’t given to the defendants to collect witnesses, but that
doesn’t preclude the fact that the victims of the alleged crimes were
also not only not allowed time to collect witnesses, but weren’t even
allowed to testify in the first place, which renders all of the legal
proceedings, “according to their best judgment,” completely irrelevant.
Ford was also sympathetic to the fact that Jo had been told to do what
he did by people who were just trying to gain his favor. He’d
communicated that to Jo in his initial letter telling the prophet to
surrender. If Jo and his city councilors had received bad information
from sycophants practicing sophistry to gain the prophet’s favor, they
could unwittingly commit crimes while thinking it was according to the
best judgment. That may have been a reasonable defense at some point but
I don’t tend to give it much credence. Jo knew what he was doing all
along and even if individual actions were made out of ignorance,
ignorance isn’t a defense in a court of criminal law.

The conversation among these men continued with Jo’s legal counsel
eventually chiming in.

I’m sure by this point Governor Ford had to remove his face from his
palm to explain that he wasn’t buying this. The record only says
“Governor Ford spoke of the Constitution.” Governor Ford knew what had
happened in Missouri during the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838 which is why
he was handling this matter personally in the first place; he’d seen the
consequences of Governor Boggs not handling the matters personally and
was determined to not repeat Boggs’s mistake. Jo’s witnesses weren’t
detained and withheld from testifying in the November trial because it
wasn’t a trial; it was only a court of inquiry to determine if there was
enough evidence to move forward with fact-finding and the state’s
prosecuting attorney forming a case against Jo and his fellow lawless
banditti. They escaped prison before the jury trial could be held which
would have called Jo’s witnesses to testify about events during the
Missouri-Mormon war. Governor Ford simply “spoke of the constitution”
probably to try and teach Jo once and for all about how criminal cases
are tried but of course the dude already had his conclusions and
wouldn’t change his beliefs no matter how much evidence was presented
to the contrary. Ford’s other point there is notable though. Jo’s
counsel echoed the same concerns Jo had repeatedly told Ford before,
that he didn’t expect to get a fair trial in Carthage and decided to
hold the hearing in Nauvoo for that reason. Governor Ford, being no
idiot, recognized that no trial in Nauvoo which included Jo was a fair
trial and therefore simply replied prudently that he was there to
enforce the laws on all people, Mormons or not.

We weren’t trying to resist the government when we declared martial law
and refused to comply with multiple arrest warrants, we were just trying
to defend ourselves against the law trying to arrest us. I wonder if
that statement struck Jo as asinine when he said it as it does when we
read it now. Don’t worry, Governor Ford, everything is all right.

That was essentially the material bulk of the conversation between
Governor Ford and Joseph Smith. It’s kind of hard to nail down exactly
what was said, what the body language between Jo and Governor Ford was
like, and just generally everything that was shared in the conversation.
I removed some portions from the Willard Richards account that makes up
the majority of what is contained in the History of the Church because
it’s very clearly a propagandized version and contains obvious
expansions from the mouth of Jo that he probably never said but was
added by Richards and George A. Smith later.

This was the long-awaited interview Jo sought with Governor Ford to
allay the excitement, answer all his charges, and provide explanations
that no legal recourse was necessary as no legal wrong had been
committed.

However, Jo did state immediately after Governor Ford left the meeting
something that was recorded by Richards in his journal for that day,
making it contemporary and likely very accurate to what Jo said.

> Joseph remarked, “I have had a good deal of anxiety about my safety
> since I left Nauvoo, which I never had before when I was under arrest.
> I could not help those feelings, and they have depressed me.”

Regardless of what the History of the Church tells us about how well the
meeting went, Jo’s remarks immediately after reveal a great deal about
his immediate impressions after the conversation. Governor Ford was
clearly not one to be easily swayed by partisanship and the mob
mentality prevailing among Jo and his enemies. He seems to have clearly
understood what happened, what was going on, what Jo was telling him,
and already knew how best to act in response to the information. Whether
or not this conversation influenced his actions can’t be known but I’m
sure it allowed him to view the situation more completely than he did
before. This was the last time Jo and Governor Ford would speak.

The men inside the Carthage debtor’s apartment, which is the larger of
two rooms on the second floor, took stock of the safety of the room. It
was clear that the guards outside were the ones keeping them from
escaping because the locking mechanism on the door to the cell was
broken.

> Most of the forenoon was spent by Dan Jones and Col. Stephen Markham
> in hewing with a penknife, a warped door to get it on the latch, thus
> preparing to fortify the place against any attack.

They were only marginally successful as the latch on the door provided
little resistance to the mob which pushed through the following evening.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. They also took serious the charge
of every member a missionary, especially when many of those members in
the jail cell were high-ranking leaders in the church. They spent a few
hours after the meeting with Governor Ford “preaching to the guards,
several of whom were relieved before their time was out”. According to
White-out Willard Richards’s account of this preaching, “they admitted
they were convinced of the innocence of the prisoners.” Richards even
went so far as to claim that some of them left after hearing this
preaching while saying, “Let us go home, boys, for I will not fight any
longer against these men.” Whether that happened or not, I kind of
doubt. The people tasked with guarding the prisoners at Carthage were
citizens of Carthage who viewed the prisoners as their enemies
regardless of anything the prisoners may be able to say. Similar to the
conversation with Governor Ford, Jo wasn’t actually as convincing as the
record shows to us, or else none of the following events of June
26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> would have happened.

While the prisoners remained in Carthage, it was a time for conversation
and personal reflection among them. White-out Willard spent the majority
of this incarceration recording in his little pocket journal from which
he was able to reconstruct all of this while working on the History of
the Church. Jo and Hyrum shared a few moments of discussion.

> During the day Hyrum encouraged Joseph to think that the Lord, for his
> Church’s sake, would release him from prison. Joseph replied, “Could
> my brother Hyrum but be liberated, it would not matter so much about
> me; poor Rigdon, I am glad he is gone to Pittsburgh out of the way;
> were he to preside he would lead the church to destruction in less
> than five years.”

This conversation wasn’t recorded in Richards’s journal which is notable
because everything in the HoC preceding and following it is all straight
from his journal. This was added later because Hingepin Sidney Rigdon
held a legitimate claim to the throne which Bloody Brigham Young
considered a threat. I’ve heard people today trot out this line from Jo
that he said Rigdon would lead the church to destruction but Jo never
said that. Those words were put in his mouth posthumously by the SLC
leadership. Notably as well, the fatalist leanings in Jo’s words were
all post-hoc as well. His contemporary words are far more light-hearted
and optimistic about the outcome of this whole affair, but White-out
Willard Richards and George A. Smith added many statements to Jo’s stay
in Carthage that make it seem like he knew he would die a martyr.

Lies and propagandized history aside, the day was still young. Legal
counsel for Jo and friends charged that the original mittimus was
illegitimate to continue holding the prisoners in the Carthage jail. The
charge of treason against Jo and Hyrum needed a separate hearing to
determine if they’d continue to be held in Carthage jail or they’d be
released on habeas corpus for lack of criminal charges.

> One of the counsel for the prosecution expressed a wish to Esq. Reid,
> that the prisoners should be brought out of jail for examination on
> the charge of treason; \[h\]e was answered that the prisoners had
> already been committed “until discharged by due course of law”; and
> therefore the justice and constable had no further control of the
> prisoners, and that if the prosecutors wished the prisoners brought
> out of jail, they might bring them out on a writ of habeas corpus, or
> some other “due course of law”; when we would appear and defend.

Jo’s counsel was relatively optimistic about the outcome of this
forthcoming examination.

> Counselor Reid said that he had got the magistrate on a pin hook, for
> the magistrate had committed them without examination, and had no
> further jurisdiction in the case, and he would not agree to a trial
> unless (Captain) Justice Smith would consent to go to Nauvoo for
> examination, where witnesses could be had.

The argument Hugh T. Reid was telling Jo about here was essentially that
they had been committed to jail without determining if there was any
merit to the original charges of treason filed by Henry Norton and
Augustine Spencer against Jo and Hyrum. In order to determine if there
was any merit, Reid believed the justice would have to convey the
prisoners to Nauvoo to hold the trial there where they could examine
witnesses about the charges of treason and the declaration of martial
law. This would be a severe advantage on the part of Jo and Hyrum
because they’d be playing on home turf and witnesses could be produced
for any desired outcome in Nauvoo.

Amidst this meeting between the prisoners and their legal counsel, Hugh
T. Reid, the town took lunch and, as expected, Governor Ford was
surrounded by anti-Mormons hell-bent on vigilante justice.

> It was common conversation on the camp ground and in the dining-room
> of the hotel, in the presence of Governor Ford, “The law is too short
> for these men, but they must not be suffered to go at large”; and, “if
> the law will not reach them, powder and ball must.”

While we know the outcome of these legal proceedings and what transpired
the following day. The outcome was far less-certain for the people
living through this. It was a constant fear in the minds of the
anti-Mormons that Jo would somehow get out of these legal troubles like
he’d gotten out of every legal battle he’d faced before. It was equally
feared by Jo and his friends that this time the charges would actually
stick and that Jo had worn out his Teflon coating. If Jo somehow
weaseled his way out of the legal system again, the old citizens of
Hancock County would make sure that no legal maneuvers would save him
from deserved justice of the death penalty. Jo and his friends wanted
the previous hearings in Nauvoo to prevail and if they could get this
case transferred back to Nauvoo they’d undoubtedly win the fight once
again and would roam free to continue devising the Mormon revolution of
America. With all the said, a lot was on the line in the afternoon of
June 26<sup>th</sup> and this hearing.

> ½ past 2. Constable Bettisworth came with Alexander Simpson, and
> wanted to come in, with an order to the jailor demanding the prisoners
> committed to his charge, he refused to give them up, until discharged
> from his custody by due course of law.

The legitimacy of every document produced by anybody here was rightfully
being challenged. Until Constable Bettisworth could prove that the order
to remove the prisoners from the jail was legitimate. It could be a plot
by friends of the prisoners to escape, or it could be a plot by the
anti-Mormons to assassinate the prisoners right then and there. The
jailor, Stigall, was smart to refuse the order until it was proven
legitimate. However, this also had the effect of exciting the militia
outside the jail who expected Constable Bettisworth to exit the jail
with Jo in handcuffs behind him. When he left the jail upon the refusal
of the jailor to deliver the prisoners, they viewed it as yet another
act of opposition.

Jo immediately sent a letter to his legal counselors, James Woods and
Hugh T. Reid.

GET OVER HERE NOW, THEY’RE ABOUT TO KILL US\! This all caused a huge
cloud of chaos to descend over the city. Judge Robert F. Smith wanted to
hold the preliminary hearing for treason to answer the charge that the
original mittimus committing them to Carthage Jail was based on invalid
charges and therefore invalid itself. When the jailor refused to give up
the prisoners, Justice Robert F. Smith told Governor Ford about the
situation.

> Justice Robert F. Smith then inquired what he must do? Governor Ford
> replied, “We have plenty of troops; there are the Carthage Greys under
> your command, bring them out.”

Accordingly, 40 minutes after the constable first showed up to take the
prisoners before Justice Robert F. Smith, he came back with the Carthage
Greys, who’d shown themselves to be a bit more headstrong against
Governor Ford’s orders the previous day and a half.

Just as Governor Ford and Justice Morrison had concluded before, and now
Jo seemed to realize, the jail was the safest place for them. Now,
however, he was being dragged out kicking and screaming to his hearing
through the city square of Carthage, where over a thousand armed men
wanted him dead and he didn’t have the cover of the jail walls for them
to breach before committing the assassination.

> Elders Taylor, Jones, Markham, and Fullmer followed, outside the

This hearing was to charge Hyrum and Jo with treason by the complaints
which had imprisoned them the previous evening. They didn’t get
assassinated right then and there when they were extremely vulnerable
and surrounded by enemy militias and escorted by the Carthage Greys.
Governor Ford was in town, though, so daddy was keeping an eye on
everything that was going on and ensuring good order was followed.

Did the opposite counsel object because the defense wanted witnesses, or
because Hugh T. Reid asked to transfer the case to Nauvoo where they
could call witnesses from within the city as he’d stated in his previous
meeting with Jo and the boys? I find the latter explanation more
plausible; the last thing the citizens of Carthage wanted was for this
case to go to Nauvoo where it would be swept away and the prisoners
would walk free, but simply having witnesses at the Carthage trial here
would make plenty of sense and be expected in the due process of law.

The court deliberated for a while about whether or not the original
mittimus was legitimate. There was a discrepancy in the date of the
mittimus signed by Justice Robert F. Smith versus the mittimus Constable
Bettisworth issued to the prisoners in Hamilton’s Hotel and used to lock
them up in Carthage.

It was a moot point, however, as the available mittimus committed them
to prison until a full jury trial could be heard.

The counsel on behalf of the state is absolutely amazing. The
prosecuting attorney was, once again, Chauncey L. Higbee, who was
qualified to serve that position but was far from an independent and
unbiased prosecutor in the case as it concerned what happened after his
Expositor printing press was destroyed and he’d repeatedly tangled with
Jo in the Nauvoo court system before. Also there was a guy named Onias
Skinner, who hasn’t come up in our timeline before but he was a member
of the anti-Mormon political party. Also, Sylvester Emmons, the editor
of the Nauvoo Expositor and Thomas Morrison, the original justice who
issued the arrest order Jo defied in Nauvoo the day after the Expositor
was destroyed. The final name of the state’s legal counsel is simply
remarkable. He’s a guy we’ve talked about on the show a ton because of
his frequent and scathing reports against the Mormons in his paper, the
Warsaw Signal. Yes, Thomas Coke Sharp, the ultimate anti-Mormon, one of
the founders of the anti-Mormon political party, and recipient of a
death threat by Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, that Thomas Coke Sharp,
served as the final member of the prosecuting counsel. This who’s who of
anti-Mormons would likely remain the state’s legal counsel in the coming
jury trial for treason. They all had conflicts of interest and should
have all recused themselves from the case, but these guys viewed the
Mormon problem created by Jo as a personal affront to their own
liberties and they would never let this case slip through their hands if
they had the opportunity to throw the book at Jo and send him to the
gallows.

Jo’s counsel, James Woods, Esq., stated in court “they were committed to
jail without any examination whatever.” After which, Hugh T. Reid, the
other counselor for Jo and his buddies, “urged a continuance of the case
till the witnesses could be obtained from Nauvoo, for the defense.”

This was simply a hearing to determine if the prisoners should remain in
Carthage jail because the state had enough evidence to seek discovery
and witnesses based on the charges of treason. No witnesses were
available from Nauvoo and couldn’t be produced any moment before the
next afternoon and that was only if a rider was sent from Carthage
immediately after the hearing to subpoena those witnesses. The earliest
the prosecution could undertake a trial would be the next day at noon.

> Mr. Skinner suggested that the court adjourn until 12 o’clock
> tomorrow.
> 
> Mr. Woods proposed that the court adjourn until witnesses could be got
> together, or until tomorrow at any time, and again adjourn if they are
> not ready, without brining the prisoners into court.

The witnesses were probably named but White-out Willard didn’t seem to
catch their names or he couldn’t write fast enough. This hearing took
less than an hour and there was a lot of confusion so I don’t blame
Richards’s record for being a bit light.

Understandably, Nauvoo citizens didn’t know what was going on in
Carthage and when they received a subpoena to appear in Carthage where
they may or may not have learned that Jo and Hyrum were in jail for
treason, what would they think? Jo had prepped the Mormons for war and
the Carthaginians were the sworn enemies of the Mormons, would they
comply with the subpoenas?

> Mr. Reid hoped no compulsory measures would be made use of by the
> prosecution in this enlightened country.

Subpoena the witnesses but please don’t arrest them. They’ll comply
without the use of force, no need to hit them with tear gas, shoot them
with rubber bullets, or run them over with SUVs, they won’t resist. The
prosecution responded.

> Mr. Skinner: \[“\]If witnesses cannot be had after due diligence by
> the defense, a continuance will be granted.\[“\]

The hearing concluded.

> On motion of counsel for the prisoners, examination was postponed till
> tomorrow at 12 o’clock noon, and subpoenas were granted to get
> witnesses from Nauvoo, twenty miles distance; whereupon the prisoners
> were remanded to prison, with the following mittimus

And then it prints a new mittimus signed by Justice Robert F. Smith that
day based on the continuance of the trail until tomorrow. After which
the prisoners were “Returned to jail, and Joseph and Hyrum were thrust
into close confinement.” At this point, the rest of the prisoners,
Richards, Taylor, Fullmer, Dan Jones, Piggy-bank Steve Markham, were all
placed in the debtors jail apartment, with Jo and Hyrum in the prison
cells in the adjacent room. Upon hearing of this increased security,
whatever the reasons for doing it, Governor Ford sent an order to the
jailor.

> I would advise the jailor to keep the Messrs. Smith in the room in
> which I found them this morning, unless a closer confinement should be
> clearly necessary to prevent an escape.

It seems that locking Jo and Hyrum in the cell was a bit excessive
punishment without justification and Governor Ford could recognize that.

After this hearing, which Jo and Hyrum somehow survived without being
assassinated, a curious old man entered the city of Carthage. He was
largely unknown by any of the residents, but he was a welcome sight for
the prisoners to see out the windows of the jail cell. Uncle John Smith.
Jo and Hyrum’s uncle had received the letter from Jo a week and a half
ago to only give up the arms of the Mormons living in Macedonia to the
militia if the militia pried those guns from their cold, dead fingers.
This old man approached the jailor in view of Jo and Hyrum looking out
the window.

> 
> Father \[Uncle John\] Smith then left the jail to convey this message
> to A. W. Babbit, who was at Macedonia.

Almon Babbit would arrive in Carthage by the next day carrying an
unexpected message with him. We must wait before we’re able to discuss
that message specifically. Uncle John ended up meeting Almon Babbit on
the road back to Macedonia and told Babbit of Jo’s request. He replied
cryptically, “You are too late, I am already engaged on the other side.”
Other side of what? Was he working with the enemies? Or was he engaged
in Macedonia with Illinois militias occupying the city and didn’t think
it prudent to leave the city for Carthage? We’ll never know what was
actually meant by that statement because it was probably a fabrication
by the compiler of the HoC, George A. Smith, who wrote it after Almon
Babbit had been excommunicated from the SLC church, merely months before
he was mysteriously killed in Nebraska territory in 1856.

After Uncle John’s visit, Jo received a much-appreciated letter from his
personal scribe, Quilliam Claypen, who he’d instructed just 3 days prior
to burn or bury the Council of Fifty Minutes. The letter Jo received is
interesting as there appears to be coded language, which wasn’t uncommon
among the Mormon leadership. When the Mormons were stealing the
Missourian’s property during the Missouri-Mormon war of 1838, they were
instructed to call the hogs they stole bears and the cattle they stole
buffalo. Some language in Claypen’s letter to Jo here could also be
coded.

> W. CLAYTON.

Upon reading the letter from Quilliam Claypen, Jo sent the messenger,
Joel S. Miles, back to Nauvoo with a list of documents to bring to
Carthage for the hearing tomorrow. Jo also “Sent a message to \[his
legal\] Counselor \[James\] Woods to get subpoenas for Samuel James,
Edward Hunter and Philip B. Lewis, with instructions to bring with them
the papers that they carried to the Governor at Springfield, and which
the Governor had not seen, as he had started for Carthage before they
arrived at Springfield.”

Once these witnesses and documents had been sent for in Nauvoo, Jo and
the city took supper close to 8 p.m. After dinner, however, Jo and Hyrum
were visited in the debtors apartment of Carthage jail by their legal
counsel, James Woods and Hugh T. Reid. They brought some interesting
information with them concerning a meeting they’d just attended with
Governor Thomas Ford. A decision had been made which would prove
incredibly consequential, to the point of being fatal.

> Counselors Woods and Reid called with Elder J. P. Greene, and said
> that the Governor and military officers had held a council which had
> been called by the Governor, and they decided that the Governor and
> all the troops should march to Nauvoo at 8 o’clock tomorrow, except
> one company of about 50 men, in order to gratify the troops, and
> return the next day, the company of fifty men to be selected by the
> Governor from those of the troops whose fidelity he could *most* rely
> on, to guard the prisoners, who should be left in Carthage Jail; and
> that their trial be deferred until Saturday, the 29<sup>th</sup>.

Now the original mittimus issued by Justice Robert F. Smith which said
the hearing would occur June 27<sup>th</sup> at noon was silently
amended to read 29<sup>th</sup> of June. “This was done without
consulting either the prisoners or their counsel.” It was decided, the
hearing would happen June 29<sup>th</sup> instead of 27<sup>th</sup>,
the prisoners would languish in prison for 2 days longer than expected,
and most importantly, Governor Ford would personally march a small
contingent of his militia forces into Nauvoo to collect documents and
witnesses and get a finger on the pulse of the city. He would leave
tomorrow morning sometime, leaving only 50 of his most trusted guards in
Carthage to make sure nothing bad happened to the prisoners.

Without Governor Ford in Carthage, the foxes will be guarding the
henhouse. The decision was made and Ford would not be taking the
prisoners with him to Nauvoo as he’d said he would. They were too much
of a liability to carry to Nauvoo and attempt to bring back to Carthage
once business was concluded in Nauvoo.

Let’s hear a bit from Governor Ford about the decision-making process
which led him to head to Nauvoo on the morning of the 27<sup>th</sup>
because the correct choice amidst all this public fury was anything but
clear.

> All these considerations \[of a possible Illinois-Mormon war\] were
> duly urged by me upon the attention of a council of officers, convened

Not only did Governor Ford not listen to the majority of militiamen that
he should march to Nauvoo with the state’s militia forces, but he went
so far as to disband the 1300 some odd militia men in Carthage and
Warsaw and send them all home so he could handle this issue without the
constant presence of militias making everything more urgent and
complicated. He continues:

Governor Ford, for the security of his prisoners, disbanded the militias
as they were not needed, refused to march a large force into Nauvoo
except for himself and a small platoon to search for the counterfeit
machinery and deliver a speech telling the Mormons they were on thin
ice, and left only a small contingent of the Carthage Greys, under the
command of a guy he trusted, to guard the prisoners while he was in
Nauvoo. What else could he do? He said it himself, he couldn’t find
anybody to guard the prisoners who weren’t their enemies unless he
called in the Nauvoo Legion to do the job which would immediately
escalate tensions and result in war.

That’s a great point. If the Carthage Greys were to assassinate Joseph
Smith, the Mormons would know and their property was the closest to the
Mormon settlement upon which they would wreak their vengeance. But, of
course, Governor Ford had many more demons on his shoulders attempting
to influence his decision-making.

With all of these pressures tugging Governor Ford in all directions, his
resolve to go to Nauvoo provided exactly the window the assassins needed
to put their plan into effect. Ford’s decision to not take the prisoners
with him on the trip to Nauvoo the following day would echo through the
remainder of his career and blight Ford’s legacy from that time forward.

With this troubling information about Ford’s decisions, the prisoners
settled into their apartment in the upper story of Carthage jail.

Jo’s ranting concluded, the men resigned to the exhaustion overcoming
them as the sun had long set beneath the horizon.

They wouldn’t enquire as to the source of this gunshot until the
following morning but it was understandably upsetting for the men who
all feared their lives would be taken by vigilante justice by the
infuriated militias occupying the city under the careful watch of
Governor Ford. Governor Ford could keep the peace tonight, but what
about when he leaves tomorrow morning? A touching and iconic moment of
Mormon history takes place on Jo and Hyrum’s last living night.

This night of June 26<sup>th</sup>, 1844 marks the final night Joseph
and Hyrum Smith would lay their heads down to sleep. The mad tyrant
would be dead before the sun set the following day.

Alright listeners, let’s step back a bit and chat for a minute here. The
death of Joseph Smith has been an inevitable conclusion we’ve been
pursuing for 5 and a half years now. I’ve lost a lot of sleep and put
scores of hours into how to handle Carthage in a way that will do
justice to the literal thousands of hours of research which have gone
into constructing our historical timeline. I want to be proud of the
result. When I’m recording this, Naked Mormonism is ranked
5<sup>th</sup> in its category on iTunes with over 2.5 million overall
downloads. Honestly, I take a lot of pride in those milestones but that
pride also comes with the recognition that the death of Joseph Smith
will be the greatest undertaking of the podcast so far. I know that
y’all have been waiting years for this just like me and I want us all
to get there together and feel happy with the result. This is a big
event and that means we’re going to take our time so I can do this
right.

What does “right” look like? A ten-part series over the coming weeks.
These will be special episodes. 7 of them will be devoted to examining
the life of Joseph Smith and early Mormonism through different
perspectives and highlighting certain aspects. Then, episodes 8-10 will
cover the June 27<sup>th</sup> assassination of Joseph and Hyrum Smith
and the aftermath.

I’ve come to understand the listening audience falls into three broad
categories and I want to speak to each of those categories individually
right now.

The first category is new listeners who haven’t heard the entire backlog
of the podcast and just jump in at an arbitrary point. I want this
10-part series to essentially be an index or a directory to the entire
200+ episode backlog. These episodes will contain stories from all over
early Mormon history with episode numbers to back them up in case you
want to venture into the backlog for a deeper dive.

The second category are the casual listeners. Maybe you’ve listened to
the entire backlog, maybe you’ve skipped a few episodes here and there.
Y’all usually put on the podcast when you’re doing menial tasks or
falling asleep. You remember a lot of stories from early Mormon history,
but a lot of that information isn’t readily available upon recall. This
series will be a refresher for all of you and bring y’all up to speed on
the entire 39 years of Jo’s life and 14 years of ministry.

The third and final category of listeners represent a small percentage
of the audience, but in many ways they’re the listeners to whom I owe
the most. These are the listeners who’ve listened eagerly to every
episode as soon as it dropped. They’ve watched every presentation, heard
every guest spot or interview I’ve done, and often they’re supporters of
the show on patreon.com/nakedmormonism. You know more Mormon history
than 99% of Mormons will ever learn. I want this 10-part series to leave
you feeling like we’ve all collectively arrived to the end of a massive
journey together. Through thick and thin, hardship and leisure, joy and
sorrow, you small group of devoted listeners have been with me the
longest and have been the most supportive and I’ve learned the most
along this journey from these amazing people. I owe it to each and every
one of you to do the death of Joseph Smith right which is going to
require patience and tenacity from each and every one of you who’ve been
looking forward to the death of Joseph Smith for years now.

With all that said, the series isn’t ready yet and I refuse to go to air
until it’s up to my expectations. For at least the last 10 episodes,
we’ve been rocketing to Carthage focusing solely on Joseph Smith and
leaving a lot behind. There are plenty of loose threads and people I
want to catch up with in the timeline. What’s Emma been up to? How’s
Bloody Brigham Young doing out in the eastern states electioneering for
the prophet? What’s Eliza R. Snow been doing on the Morley settlement
while basically running the Relief Society in Emma’s absence? What have
the publishers of the Expositor been doing since the press was
destroyed? We’re going to spend the next few episodes drawing these
threads together to get everything set up for the coming Road to
Carthage series. I’ve left enough behind to fill multiple episodes. But
I also don’t want to bore everybody with superfluous details until the
10-part series is ready to air so I promise I won’t keep you waiting a
second longer than I have to in order to really stick the landing here.

That’s the podcast forecast for the coming months. Hang in there,
listeners. I want to thank all of you for giving me your time and
support. Let’s all eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow Jo dies.
