Ep 212 – Emma Smith, Linda Newell, and Valeen Avery

On this episode, Joseph and Hyrum Smith are locked up in Carthage Jail
and they aren’t going anywhere. We take a little time to catch up with
other prominent figures in Nauvoo history; this week begins with Emma
Hale Smith. We discuss her role in the Relief Society, unwillingly
policing polygamy rumors, running land speculation and deals while her
husband is occupied, and fighting with her sister wives. Then we focus
on her role in the two week period of June 12-25 1844 and her actions
which have been construed by the SLC leadership to lead to Jo’s death.
Is she responsible? Or, are those myths fabricated by the SLC propaganda
machine which have been debunked by historians? This episode interweaves
Emma’s story with the story of her seminal biographers, Valeen Tippets
Avery and Linda King Newell on their journey writing Emma’s biography
through the 1970s-80s.

We’ve spent the last dozen or so episodes focusing almost exclusively on
Joseph Smith and the historical timeline through May and June of 1844.
The truth is, a lot was going on with other people connected with the
church during this time. Understandably, the events leading up to, and
following, the Nauvoo Expositor consume all the oxygen in the historical
record, casting a shadow over every other notable figure during the
timeframe. I want to spend the next few episodes catching up with those
folks so let’s start today with discussing Emma Smith.

During my off-time I’ve been reading an anthology of Mormon historians
titled Writing Mormon History, historians and their books, edited by
friend of the show, Joe Geisner. It’s a compilation of essays from many
of the most notable Mormon historians of the past 5 decades telling the
stories of how their seminal works came to fruition. It’s a fascinating
book and I recommend listeners purchase Writing Mormon History edited by
Joseph Geisner at your local or independent online bookstore. Why I
bring it up is because the last chapter I read was written by Linda King
Newell, who wrote the best biography of Emma Smith with her co-author,
Valeen Tippets Avery. The chapter is remarkable as it places the readers
into the sphere of Mormon history through the lens of two independent
women researchers in the late 70s and early 80s in the field of Mormon
history completely dominated by men.

Unfortunately, Val Avery passed away a few years ago, so the chapter is
written by Linda Newell and we can only see her side of the writing
project of Emma’s biography, but Linda’s stories about herself and other
women in Mormon history are remarkable. The chapter begins with a story
I’m sure many of us can empathize with Linda when she learned a slanted
version of Emma Hale Smith’s life. That’s because Emma’s treatment by
the LDS church until the 80s was silence at best and caustically
derisive at worst. From Writing Mormon History beginning on page 162,
Linda begins to tell her story:

> My own journey with Emma Hale Smith began \[at Ohio State\] in 1973. I
> attended a BYU Education Week where Jaynann Payne from Provo, Utah,
> was one of the speakers. Her topic was “My Friend Eliza R. Snow.”
> Dressed in a long, ornate black silk dress with matching hat—an exact
> copy of the one Eliza R. Snow wore in her famous photograph—Jaynann
> spoke eloquently of Eliza, often comparing her with Emma: Emma was not
> as faithful as Eliza; Emma abandoned her faith and the church by not
> going west when Eliza did; Emma kept the prophet’s sons from the
> church; and Emma did not love Joseph as much as his plural wife,
> Eliza, did. I was puzzled.

Linda Newell then details her journey in searching for a biography of
Emma written from a faithful Mormon perspective, being a believer
herself. The search came up almost dry. All she found was a 25-page
pamphlet titled Judge Me Dear Reader, “and a biographical novel, Emma
Smith: The Elect Lady, by RLDS writer Margaret Gibson.” Linda adds that
“the latter was truly a work of fiction.” And the former had its own
problems written from a faithful Mormon perspective because the 25-page
short novel claimed “Emma’s transgressions \[were\] because she suffered
a ‘mental breakdown’.”

Linda Newell decided to write her own biography of Emma that would do
proper justice to the Elect Lady. From this project, Mormon Enigma was
born.

But let’s rewind a little bit. From where did this caustic Mormon
narrative come? Emma Hale Smith didn’t go to Utah, she was mother of
Joseph III and guided him to become prophet of the RLDS church, the
primary competing faction to the SLC LDS church; Emma hated Bloody
Brigham Young, justifiably so because he was a power-hungry demon
lurking in the shadows until center-stage was vacant. The power struggle
between her and Brigham left Emma as the quintessential enemy to
polygamy, a worthy personification for the burgeoning SLC leadership to
vilify.

Until Jo and Hyrum were assassinated, Emma occupied multiple important
roles in the church. However, the tension resulting from the Laws and
the Smiths in the last months of 1843 had revealed to Jo and everybody
else caught up in polygamy that Emma was not as approving of the
doctrine and practice as she’d previously been. The majority of the
higher ranks of leadership, those of the anointed quorum, pushed Emma to
the fringes and forced her to become an island unto herself. Emma, as
cordial and guarded as her deportment would dictate, had to balance the
secretive life of her husband and sister-wives and the resulting drama,
with her public life as an anti-polygamist and only legal wife of her
husband. She was able to act somewhat less guarded among insiders, but
she clearly wasn’t attuned to who did and didn’t know the extent of
polygamy and therefore had to exercise caution in nearly every
interaction. This caution, however, didn’t stop her from speaking her
typical sharp wit when circumstances required.

Speaking of autumn to winter of 1843, Newell and Avery describe this
balancing act in their biography of Emma Hale Smith Bidamon, Mormon
Enigma.

> Emma and Joseph maintained an outwardly warm and loving relationship
> in spite of the tension. Joseph remarked to William Phelps that he had
> a kind, provident wife who would load the table with good things to
> eat until the sight destroyed his appetite when all he had asked her
> for was a little bread and milk. Emma came into the room in time to
> hear William Phelps say, “You must do as Buonaparte did,--have a
> little table just large enough for the victuals you want yourself.”
> 
> With tact born of experience, Emma replied, “Mr. Smith is a bigger man
> than Buonaparte; he can never eat without his friends.”
> 
> “That is the wisest thing I ever heard you say,” Joseph commented.

Another reminiscence from Benjamin F. Johnson describes where Emma fell
in the hierarchy of wives in the prophet’s life, obviously a major
source of tension in theirs and all religious polygamist marriages.

> In 1903 Benjamin F. Johnson reminisced about a Sunday morning in
> Joseph’s home. “Two of Emmas childr\[e\]n Came to him as just from
> there Mother—all So nice bright & Sweet.” Joseph turned to his guest.
> “Benjamin, look at these Children. How Could I help loving thire
> mother; If Necessary I would go to *Hell* for Such a woman.” Johnson
> added, “… although at the time he had in the Mansion other wives
> younger & aparently more Brilliant—Yet Emma the wife of his youth—to
> me apeared the Queen of his *heart* & of his *home.*”

Emma was fighting a constant battle. She was clearly fed up with
polygamy and her husband’s overactive libido influencing other men of
the community to practice polygamy as well. Whether by virtue of the
position of the leaders in the Relief Society as her sister-wives, or
something about her general opposition to polygamy, or maybe it had to
do with Emma seeking distractions from the chaotic life in Nauvoo and
escaping the drama, her role in the Relief Society shrunk. The issue
with Jane and William Law and the Smiths seemed to have been a breaking
point for Emma. It is notable that a contemporary expose written by
Joseph H. Jackson claims there was a couples swing facilitated between
the Laws and Smiths and that Emma desired that “sweet little man”
William Law for herself while Jo was clearly gunning for Jane Law.
Multiple denials from William Law and Emma cast Jackson’s assertion into
question, as well as Jackson’s general lack of trustworthiness. Patrons
of the show can listen along to his exposes in our latest installment of
the NaMo Book Club at patreon.com/nakedmormonism. Whether the deal
happened and was mutually agreed to, whether a swing did happen, or
whether it was all fabricated, the record isn’t clear but there’s a lot
of smoke for there not to be a fire. Whatever happened, the result is
unquestionable, the Laws defected and Emma was pushed further from the
inner-circles of the criminal empire… at least at face value.

Beginning at the top of Chapter 12 of Mormon Enigma:

> Although Emma’s open opposition to plural marriage had ceased since
> receiving her second anointing (yeah, psychedelics will do that to
> ya), the presence of some of Joseph’s young wives under her roof
> nagged at her. She continued to confront Joseph with the issue.
> 
> Emily Partridge was the only plural wife who recounted the events. She
> said that interviews with Joseph, her sister, herself, and Emma
> occurred frequently. “She sent for us one day to come to her room.
> Joseph was present looking like a martyr. Emma said some very hard
> things. Joseph should give us up or blood would flow. She would rather
> her blood would run pure than be poluted in this manner.” Emily did
> not say precisely that Emma threatened suicide, but perhaps Joseph’s
> fear that Emma had reached the point of taking such a drastic step
> prompted this final confrontation. Emily “felt indignant towards
> Joseph for submitting to Emma… His countenance was the perfect picture
> of despair.” Emily wrote, “\[Emma\] insisted that we should promise to
> break our \[marriage\] covenants that we had made before God. Joseph
> asked her if we made her the promise she required, if she would cease
> to trouble us, and not persist in our marrying someone else. She made
> the promise. Joseph came to us and shook hands with us and the
> understanding was that all was ended between us. I for one meant to
> keep this promise I was forced to make.”

Emily and Eliza Partridge are crucial actors in this conflict raging
about polygamy in the walls of the Nauvoo Mansion. They’d essentially
become the adopted daughters of the Smiths since Edward Party-boy
Partridge had passed away in May of 1840. Emily’s journal survived the
trek west; Eliza’s, she burned because it was “too full”. In many ways,
the Partridge sisters were merely a microcosm of the larger issues in
Nauvoo, but Emma held some sway over what happened in her own home, even
if it was much harder to control the larger growing polygamist movement
in Nauvoo with all its attendant heartbreak, troubles, and abuse.

After this confrontation, Emily and Eliza went downstairs, followed soon
by Joseph who talked with Emily alone. Continuing in Mormon Enigma:

> “How do you feel, Emily?”
> 
> “I feel as anybody would under the circumstances.”
> 
> “You know my hands are tied,” Joseph responded.
> 
> Emily said he looked as if he would “sink into the earth”; her “heart
> was melted” and her anger left. But before she had time to speak
> Joseph was gone. Emma entered as he went out.
> 
> “Emily, what did Joseph say to you?” she asked.
> 
> “He asked me how I felt.”
> 
> “You might as well tell me,” Emma said. “I am determined that a stop
> shall be put to these things and I want you to tell me what he says to
> you.”
> 
> “I shall not tell you,” Emily retorted. “He can say what he pleases to
> me, and I shall not report it to you, there has been mischief enough
> made by doing that. I am sick of these things as you can be.”
> 
> Emily did not know how her words might affect Emma, but reported,
> “\[I\] learned afterwards that she gloried in my spunk.”

Yeah, I’m sure Emma absolutely loved her husband raping these teenagers
in her own home with their children sleeping in the next room. I’m sure
Emma was elated to have these repeated confrontations with her
sister-wives when it was all because Jo couldn’t keep it in his pants.
So much fun for Emma.

Emma’s opposition grew to polygamy. Now, what is later fabrication to
assassinate her character by the SLC leadership and what is fact becomes
a very hard distinction to make. Clearly Emma had problems with it and
had been pushed, coerced, and finally forced into accepting it to keep
from the private fights with her husband becoming public. However, she
was far from the only dissenting voice as contemporary records reveal.

> Emma was not alone in opposing plural marriage. Lucy A. Young, married
> to Brigham’s brother Phineas, wrote, “With a sad heart I found all the
> married people at liberty to choose new companions if they so desired.
> There was marrying and giving in marriage for the first wife was
> expected to give others to her husband unless she rebelled as I did.
> There were queens and queens of Queens in those days but I lost my
> queenship by not giving my husband the women he desired but he got
> them all the same.” She voiced the dread of many women: that their men
> would take new wives in spite of their opposition. Cynthia Osborn’s
> husband wrote, “… the doctrine of polygamy was repugnant to her and
> the thoughts of going to the body of the Church with her daughters she
> could hardly endure.”

Emma had other considerations which extended beyond just Joseph and
other high-ranking men in the church marrying teenage women. Julia
Murdock Smith, the surviving Murdock twin Joseph and Emma adopted in
Kirtland back in 1832, was 13 years old in early 1844. How long could
Emma keep her safe from Jo giving away his eldest daughter to Bloody
Brigham Young, Father Newel K. Whitney, or Heber the Creeper Kimball?
Whether or not Emma knew about Helen Mar Kimball, now 15 in 1844, or any
of the other teenagers Jo was raping, it wouldn’t be long before Julia
was prime property for the prophet to trade to one of his bois for some
generous favor. How long Before Joseph III, now 11 years old in 1844,
would be taught about polygamy and be expected to follow his father’s
footsteps? It really shouldn’t be any wonder that Emma denied polygamy
even on her death bed.

In the mid-1970s, Linda Newell’s search for the end-all biography of
Emma Smith came up disappointing because, simply put, no historian had
ever ventured to write a book-length biography of Emma Hale Smith
Bidamon from a serious academic perspective. Linda resolved to get in
touch with her friend, Valeen Tippets Avery, and have a serious
conversation about writing the greatest biography of Emma Hale ever
written. Just like it’s impossible to talk about the history of policing
in America without talking about racism, Linda and Val pretty quickly
understood that it’s impossible to talk about Emma without confronting
the practice of polygamy head on. The fact that Joseph Smith had more
wives than Emma is a generally agreed-upon consensus of nearly every
historian because the evidence is so overwhelming, but in the late 1970s
those conclusions could get members excommunicated. It wasn’t until very
recently that the church provided an official statement in the form of
the gospel topics essay about Joseph Smith’s polygamy. That was in 2013.
Prior to this the church simply allowed members to teach whatever they
will without issuing accurate Mormon history concerning the subject in
any lesson manual. Prior to that, the church openly taught that polygamy
only happened in Utah and Joseph Smith had only one wife. Into this
realm of institutional denialism and vastly ignorant membership, Val and
Linda took on the task of writing Emma’s biography.

Linda tells us how challenging it was to even begin the project:

> There were no books, articles, or conference talks about her. I found
> only the occasional references to her as Joseph’s wife, the first
> president of the Relief Society, or as the recipient of “Elect Lady”
> revelation. The Elect Lady had virtually been written out of LDS
> history.

Along with discovering just how little there was about Emma in official
or unofficial church publications, a small victory signaled a pattern
which would plague the authorship process of the biography from that
point forward.

> Val and I would eventually write the first article about Emma Hale
> Smith for an LDS Church publication in 115 years. We were delighted,
> even though Correlation (the LDS Church committee assigned to
> “standardize” all publications) redacted the original manuscript to
> where the *Ensign* published a piece half the size we submitted.

This was a harbinger of what was to come.

Emma’s role as the president of the Relief Society placed her in a
unique position of power in Nauvoo. While the reasons for forming the
Relief Society were to provide relief to the construction committees of
the church working on the temple and various other city projects, the
Relief Society’s role quickly expanded from making clothing and
providing meals to the workers to policing conduct of women in the city.
The inevitable result of practicing clandestine polygamy guaranteed
conversation among members of the Relief Society. Emma’s counselors and
secretary were all engaged in the practice. 2 of those 3 women were her
sister-wives. The first meetings of the Relief Society were devoted to
fellowship of women in the city and providing support for them,
particularly those who were left home while their husbands were on
missions for the prophet. The first meeting on March 17<sup>th</sup>
carried some ambiguous language by Emma.

> Prest. E. Smith then arose and proceeded to make appropriate remarks
> on the object of the Society—its duties to others also its relative
> duties to each other Viz. to seek out and relieve the distressed—that
> each member should be ambitious to do good—that the members should
> deal frankly with each other—to watch over the morals—and be very
> careful \<of\> the character and reputation—of the members of the
> Institution \&c.

Emma organized the Relief Society to contain self-policing measures to
ensure public perceptions remained that the “object of this Society…
\[is for\] charitable purposes”. It was the very next meeting where Emma
began with a speech “and said that measures to promote union in this
Society must be carefully attended to—that every member should be held
in full fellowship—as a society, hop’d they would divest themselves of
every jealousy and evil feeling toward each other”. In this Victorian
society, where women are already commodified, introducing a religious
polygynous hierarchy into the mix only exacerbates the competition and
jealousy among women. This played out in the Relief Society at large and
in Emma’s own home with her sister-wives.

I can only assume that Emma never wanted this role, but slipped into it
out of necessity. Nobody wants to be the rumor police, especially when
those rumors are about your own husband and his friends. Emma’s
full-time job was dealing with the problems caused by her husband and
she was forced to do so in secret to keep from rumors becoming
affidavits. This same second meeting of the Relief Society, a case
presented itself which needed to be dealt with, Clarissa Marvel. From
the Minutes linked in the show notes:

> \[Prest. E. Smith\] proceeded to read to the honorable body, a report,
> wherein Clarissa Marvel was accus’d of scandalous falsehoods on the
> character of Prest. Joseph Smith, without the least provocation,
> praying that they would in wisdom adopt some plan to bring her to
> repentance

What actually happened with Clarissa Marvel is a matter of historical
mystery as her name is incredibly elusive in contemporary documents. She
was discussed and called to repentance the following meeting; the record
reads that she signed a statement that anything she said regarding the
prophet wasn’t true. After which a speech was made by Sarah Marietta
Kingsley where she “caution\[ed\] the Society against speaking evil of
Prest. J. Smith and his companion—that it would not be a light thing in
the sight of God—that they had prov’d themselves; and the case of
C\[larissa\]. M\[arvel\]. Should be a warning, how we hear and how we
speak—her fears that the Lord would cut off those who will not take
counsel”. Thus, the pattern of secrecy and policing polygamy rumors
among the Relief Society was engraved into the record from that point
forward. We saw what happened with Clarissa Marvel, she was a warning
about how we speak, that if we speak evil of the prophet, that the Lord
would cut off those who will not take counsel. That may seem innocuous
read outside of context but that’s a death threat. When the Lord cuts
somebody off, they were to expect a visit from Pistol Packin’ Porter
Rockwell that night. A person cut off by the Lord usually didn’t wake up
the next morning.

The more Val and Linda dealt with the history of polygamy while writing
Mormon Enigma, the harder the project became at both an academic and
personal level. Linda recounts a conversation with church historian Ron
Esplin.

> One day I remember marching into Ron Esplin’s office and blurting out,
> “Everybody is lying about polygamy\! Joseph and other church leaders
> are lying\! Emma is lying\!”
> 
> Ron looked at me and calmly said, “You don’t know about the code words
> do you?” Then he explained that church leaders were answering the
> public accusations of polygamy with denials “of polygamy in the
> Asiatic sense,” or “spiritual wives,” but they privately called it
> “the new and everlasting covenant,” “celestial marriage,” or “a
> man’s privilege.”

Finally, by about 1981-2, Linda was now initiated and learned the code
words, information which would have cut her research endeavors much
shorter had the church been honest about its history and never
obfuscated or lied about that information to begin with. The simple fact
that official church historians at the time knew the code words of
polygamy and the public was unaware, and still largely is today, speaks
volumes to how much polygamy history has been deliberately lied about.
Linda reckons with this information very honestly before telling a story
about Val that hurts for me to read, especially considering this was in
the early 80s when information about Mormon polygamy was actively
suppressed and outright denied, and no internet could confirm this
information with 7 seconds on google.

> A lie is a lie whenever you knowingly lead someone to a conclusion
> that is false, even if what you say is true…
> 
> One day when I called \[Val\], I noticed her voice seemed strained and
> far away. I asked if something was wrong. “I’m sick,” she whispered,
> “sick to my stomach. I have been lying on the floor so I won’t throw
> up.” I expressed my concern and asked if she ate something that could
> have caused it. “No,” she said, “I’m just working in the polygamy
> section of Nauvoo where Joseph has taken Helen Mar Kimball as a
> wife—Linda, she was only fourteen\! That is how old Maureen is.”
> Maureen was her only daughter.

Emma’s role in the Relief Society was gatekeeper of the secrets of the
kingdom. Her word carried the weight of the prophet and her cautions
were not taken lightly. As the Relief Society continued to grow into its
own, Emma was fed information from members and her counselors as to the
extent and spread of polygamy. She would ensure compliance and secrecy
of participants through her role as president of the society. This had
multiple effects. As her role developed and her policing of rumors
increased, those in the celestial covenant began to bristle at her
constant watch. Just like Emily and Eliza Partridge chafed under Emma’s
watchful eye, the larger Society became selective of what information
was shared with Emma. Meetings continued to be held throughout 1842, but
the number of meetings dropped in 1843. Emma was active in politics and
sending letters to Governor Ford on behalf of Joseph while he remained
in hiding for the summer and autumn of 1843, having evaded extradition
to Missouri by Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds.

The final meeting of the Relief Society in 1843 occurred on October
14<sup>th</sup>. Emma’s absence was noted in this and many other
meetings that year, which points to a few trends. Emma’s time was
increasingly occupied with land speculation and recording real estate
transfers. With the completion of the Nauvoo Mansion, more visitors and
larger crowds were expected to be fed and entertained. Sick children,
often feeling ill herself, and other sundry and time-consuming affairs
ate away at Emma’s ability to oversee the Relief Society. The increasing
destitution of the Mormons, who were all living on credit as no major
manufacturing or export projects had been completed, left many sick and
hungry, unable to afford food, let alone clothes or school supplies for
the children.

But, more than all these factors, Emma was increasingly seen as hostile
by members of the Society. Her vacillation from approval to outright
abhorrence of polygamy made her unpredictable and caused the other women
in the new and everlasting covenant to be very judicious with what
information made its way to her. The Relief Society took a hiatus over
the remainder of autumn into the winter of 1843-4. During this period,
Emma stood her ground with Jo and demanded he remove his other wives
from living in the Nauvoo Mansion. Arrangements were made and the
Partridge sisters, Lawrence sisters, and Jane Manning James were
transferred to other homes to live away from Jo’s grasp and Emma’s
watchful eye. Concomitant with this purging of Jo’s younger cohabiting
wives was a precipitous drop in new wives for the prophet. While other
men in the city took more wives under the direction and approval of Jo,
he himself didn’t take any new wives. To what extent Jo was finally
acquiescing to Emma’s feelings or just trying to keep peace in the home,
or maybe he was just more successful at keeping his new marriages
secretive, we don’t know because the cloud of secrecy surrounding the
practice at the time.

It is notable that Emma’s role in Nauvoo was far more than just
regulating or obstructing polygamy. While so much conversation about
Emma in Nauvoo is focused on polygamy, her time was occupied by many
other affairs, almost exclusively financial. Joseph Smith wasn’t much
for keeping records so the messes he made left Emma constantly
scrambling to make sense of Jo’s complicated web of financial dealings
and land contracts. When Jo was liquidating his assets to file for
bankruptcy back in July to October of 1842, he transferred an insane
amount of land to Emma and his kids, leaving Emma as one of the richest
women in America at the time without nearly any documentation to back it
up. A single document from July 12, 1843 listed 28 city blocks of Nauvoo
from Jo to Emma. Her personal name is listed on at least 79 other
property transfers in just the years from 1841-43. It’s safe to say that
basically no other woman in America was this active in real estate
speculation at the same time. Notably as well, those are merely the
deeds and land records which survived, we actually don’t know the scope
and extent of Emma’s land contracts and other financial dealings.

While writing Mormon Enigma, Val and Linda were both independent
scholars and both had only written college level essays before, never a
full-length book. Both were housewives in an era where working women
were seen as an enemy to the nuclear family and female scholars were
almost completely absent from the realm of Mormon history academia with
only a few notable exceptions. Both, however, would go on after Mormon
Enigma was published to be presidents of the Mormon History Association
and give dozens of lectures and submit a handful of papers to various
journals and conferences.

Remarkably, Val and Linda self-funded the research, which we’ll discuss
in a moment. During this journey, Linda and Val met with Maureen
Ursenbach Beecher, the foremost historian on Eliza R. Snow who was in
the process of writing her seminal biography of Eliza when the three
women met. They discussed how the church would react to the coming book
on Emma.

> We asked Maureen if she thought our book might cause a negative
> reaction with church leaders. She though a moment then said, “No, I
> don’t think so. There is a new, more open climate now with Leonard
> Arrington as Church Historian. But, I would be prepared if I were
> you.”

Signals began to emerge about the church disliking the project,
particularly because of polygamy and their candid scholarly approach to
the subject. Current events played into these matters as well; the
nation was occupied with open and heated discussions about the Equal
Rights Amendment and Mormon leadership vociferously opposed, viewing the
ERA as a threat to the nuclear family and men’s dominion over their
wives and families. As women’s role in society was growing to an extent
never seen in America before the early 80s, both Val and Linda were
invited to speak at firesides and sacrament meetings about Emma… with
mixed results.

Val Avery was invited to speak at the Utah Westerners society in Salt
Lake City “about the relationship between Emma Smith and Brigham Young.”

Linda continues the story with candor.

> At that time the Utah Westerners was male only, as was the Alta Club,
> where the group met. Wilbur “Bud” Rusho, who Val had met earlier, had
> issued the invitation and accompanied her to the Alta Club the evening
> she spoke.
> 
> As they approached the front door, Bud told her, “You can’t go in that
> door, it is only for members. I will take you in the side door.”
> 
> Val shot back, “The hell you say\!” and marched up the front stairs
> and into the lobby, much to the consternation of the door guard.
> 
> “Hey, you can’t come in this door,” he confronted.
> 
> “I already did,” she said, and walked right past him.
> 
> When Bud introduced her to the group, he told of her position as a
> woman sheriff in the Flagstaff Westerners and of her grand entry into
> the Alta Club. This being the one meeting a year that wives were
> invited to attend, she received resounding applause.

Not all speaking engagements were met with such good cheer and loud
laughter. Val also spoke at a stake fireside about Emma, discussing the
issue of Joseph’s polygamy openly to an audience of mostly teenagers.
Val’s husband, Chuck, was called into the office of their stake
president to have a hostile chat about his wife’s work.

> Unbeknownst to Val, the Flagstaff Stake president had called Chuck
> into his office to talk to him. He told Chuck that Val had no right to

Then Val went on to detail another exchange between her and her bishop
when Val was invited to teach a Gospel Doctrine class on Emma. Val,
knowing the opposition she was receiving from her husband, stake
president, and bishop, declined to teach the class and instead said she
would attend and be a resource to answer questions. When the bishop
caught wind that she would be there he confronted her.

We now have the words to identify this as ecclesiastical abuse, but the
bishop, stake president, and Val’s husband, Chuck, were men operating
with authority and exercising dominion over the hysteric woman in their
lives. Such was the plight of independent women historians in the 70s
and 80s while Val and Linda were writing Emma’s biography.

The Relief Society in Nauvoo under Emma’s direction had a new piece of
propaganda to work with in 1844, known as the Voice of Innocence. Check
the backlog for episode 173 where we read through it. This piece,
written by W.W. Phelps, one of Jo’s chief propaganda ministers and his
personal ghost-writer, and it was an open denial of polygamy, using
those codewords Linda learned about in the late 1970s when she told Ron
Esplin that everybody is lying about polygamy. The first meeting of the
Relief Society in 1844 occurred on March 9 where Emma “read an Epistle
called the Voice of Innocence—adressed the Meeting on the late Slander,
of Hiram Smith \&c by O F \[Bostwick\] which called forth—the above
Epistle”. Those in attendance then voted on “who would be willing to
receive the principles of vurtue, keep the commandments of God and
uphold the \[Presidentess\] in puting \<down\> iniquity” which was
“received by unanimous voice”. As Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith had been
accused of teaching and practicing polygamy by Orsimus Bostwick and the
Warsaw Signal had published Buckeye’s Lamentation for want of more
wives, it was clear to Emma and the Relief Society counselors that
keeping polygamy under wraps was increasingly becoming a challenge.

In this same meeting, Elizabeth Ann Whitney spoke when she “requested
the Sisters to Pray that Sister Emma might be supported, to teach us the
princples of Righteousness expressed her fears, that Jugement would bgin
at the house of God”. As the Nauvoo Temple was edging ever closer to
completion by March 1844, the purposes of it were becoming clear as
well, to purge those opposed to polygamy and judge the women who would
be good candidates to be sealed to church leaders. This was merely an
extension of the initial purposes of the Society so of course the Relief
Society would be active in culling the weak and unfit for polygamy once
it was completed. When we read through contemporary exposes of the
temple ceremony, it’s very clearly a breeding ground for polygamous
practices. This hypothesis is substantiated by what Emma said
immediately after her counselor, Elizabeth Whitney, finished her speech.

> Prest. S. said it was high time for Mothers to wach over their
> Daughters & exhort them to keep the path of virtue

Watching over daughters and exhorting them to keep the path of virtue is
all very coded language when taken in the larger context of the
stratified polygamy of Nauvoo. Mothers here most likely refers to the
Mothers in Israel, the older women who were used as liaisons for church
leaders to teach the younger women about the doctrine of polygamy,
priming them to be approached by Jo or one of his best friends. What
those Mothers in Israel learned from their conversations with the
younger women would be fed back to those men who would use that
information to form their plan of attack in their proposal. If the
younger girl was receptive or open-minded to the doctrine, they’d become
a prime target for Jo or his closest buddies. If they seemed repulsed by
it, maybe the men choose a different young woman or alter their plans of
how to approach her. The path of virtue is also a loaded phrase as the
commandment on polygamy, well-known among the anointed quorum and High
Council by this time which later became D\&C 132, required new wives to
be virgins, which was never strictly adhered to by the leadership. There
was a conceptual exception to this commandment which allowed the men to
marry women who weren’t virgins, they simply needed to not have had sex
with the prospective polyandrous husband before the sealing ceremony,
making her essentially a virgin to that church leader until after the
sealing for time and eternity. This is how non-virgins could still be
considered virtuous when marrying into polygamy, even if those women had
kids with their lawful husband.

Once again, during this first meeting of the Relief Society in Nauvoo in
1844, we see Emma as tasked with the unenviable task of policing
polygamy, both the practice of it with the various participants, and
with curtailing the spread of rumors. Most historians have concluded
that these statements should be taken at face value and were made by
Emma because either her ignorance or her opposition to polygamy. I
choose to view it differently. I think Emma had so long resigned to the
fact that she couldn’t stop polygamy and the only way she could still
exercise control and be helpful in polygamy was to be the gatekeeper and
support system for the women caught up in it. Her statements can be
viewed both ways but I chose the latter, especially when we see the
minutes from the second meeting that day where Emma again read Voice of
Innocence and then continued.

> continued firther by exhorting all to take heed to their ways; and
> follow the teachings of Broather Joseph; and when he Preacheas against
> vice to take heed to it; and said; he meant what he said; concludid
> her remarks by requsting all to use theire common senses; and they
> would teach us right principles if we would adheare to them

The meeting was closed and called to reconvene for the next meeting a
week later, which would be the final time the Relief Society would meet
officially in Nauvoo. In this meeting of March 16<sup>th</sup>, 1844,
Emma continued damage control with more coded language.

> Mrs Prest… arose and adress’d the Meeting upon the Necssity of being
> united amoung ourselves and Strenthing each others hands in ordor that
> we may be able to do much good amoung the poor…

Then she read the Voice of Innocence again and “Spoke of J.C. Bennets
Spiritual Wife system, theat some taught it as the Doctrene of B
Joseph”. This is an important distinction with the code words.
Spiritual wifery was the terminology used to attack John C. Wreck-it
Bennett’s practice of polygamy once he defected. Time and eternity, new
and everlasting covenant, Abrahamic covenant, other terms in Mormon
theology today were used to describe the approved-of version of
polygamy. It was only semantics and code words used to publicly deny
polygamy while continuing to secretly practice it. The meeting adjourned
for lunch and returned at one o’clock when Emma took the stand again to,
what it looks like to me anyway, determine who would be willing to join
polygamy with a public display.

> Pres Emma Smith… Desired none shluld lift their hand or voice; to
> adopt the principles unless they where willing to maintain their
> integrity through time & Eternity Said thease contain the princples,
> the Society started upon; but was sorry to have to say all had not
> adhere’d to them

She wrapped the meeting by telling the women to follow the public
teachings of her husband and that he couldn’t use clearer language.
Spiritual wifery bad, celestial marriage good. Get it yet ladies?\! With
this final admonition, the Relief Society adjourned to never reconvene
under Emma as presidentess in Nauvoo ever again. Notable as well, Emma
was about a month along with her final of Jo’s children, David Hyrum
Smith. She wouldn’t be showing yet and nobody probably knew it at this
time, but by the time we get to June of 1844, she was four months along
and would have been showing. This is the same David Hyrum Smith who
would be locked up in an insane asylum for the last 20 years of his life
because he was gay. History is fun.

As Linda and Val continued their research for Mormon Enigma, it became
clear that no treatment of Emma without a head-on approach to polygamy
would be laughed out of academia. However, some stories had percolated
through the cultural heritage of Mormonism and they were hit with
controversial questions from audiences. Linda describes a funny little
interaction when a panel discussion was held with her, Val, and Maureen
Beecher while Maureen was progressing on Eliza Snow’s biography.

The study of polygamy in Nauvoo taps into a lot of sensibilities,
especially for historians who are believers in the form of nuclear
cis-hetero marriage the church claims today. Salacious stories like this
pervade the culture among those who know just a dabble of Mormon history
but the larger topic itself causes so much conflict and question, often
leading to answers researchers may see as counterintuitive or unnatural.
Physical altercations like Emma’s Stairway to Hell, episode 137, seem to
be rare but the competitive nature this polygamist society created
obviously created pain and heartache in addition to making many young
women the victims of sexual predation and rape. That’s uncomfortable for
a lot of people to consider, that Joseph Smith was a rapist. Even more
uncomfortable is that Emma’s inability to oppose her husband’s desires
and her unique role as president of the Relief Society made her
complicit in that sexual abuse, even though she was clearly unhappy with
the role Jo had forced on her. People don’t want to see their heroes
like the prophet and the Elect Lady of Mormonism as co-criminals on top
of a criminal syndicate of rape, but that’s the most simplistic summary
of what occurred in Nauvoo.

Publicly speaking about these controversial aspects revealed through
their research, Val and Linda both experienced increased opposition from
church leaders, local ecclesiastical authorities, and even their own
husbands. That opposition, however, was matched by encouragement from
LDS and RLDS historians who eagerly awaited the fruits of Val and
Linda’s work. Once Mormon Enigma was published, Val and Linda were
publicly banned from addressing any church gatherings about Emma or the
book. They were blacklisted, but they remained in good standing with the
church by obeying these orders. However, the Streisand effect played a
huge role and the second edition of their book, which is sitting on my
lap with margins full of notes, reads this in the introduction.

> But the book offended the leadership of the LDS Church in Utah. In
> June 1985, a month after it received the Evans award, newspaper
> headlines of the *Los Angeles Times* announced, “Mormons Forbid Female

Only a week after the ban was lifted did the Mormon History Association
name Val Avery as their president elect in 1986. What that says about
MHA and the church in the 1980s, I’m not sure so take it how you will.
Simply put, the church can only control independent researchers so much.
Val and Linda funded their research themselves, whether that was a
typist in the days before computers and word processing programs, their
trips to historic sites and archives, their thousands of pages of copied
archives, their long-distance phone calls that became a problem with
their spouses, it was all their project and everything was under their
control, much to the church’s chagrin. If they can’t control what people
publish, they will control what the public thinks about what’s
published. If that doesn’t work, they will control what the public
thinks about the person who published it in the first place.

Emma Smith’s role in the weeks prior to Jo and Hyrum’s deaths have cast
her into the category of a hysterical woman who had a mental breakdown
by those who blame her for their deaths. We can never forget that, for
all of her public opposition to polygamy and her role in the RLDS church
and raising her son to be the prophet of it, Emma became the victim of a
vicious and total character assassination campaign by the Utah
leadership. Emma’s real story is so terribly obscured by this
coordinated propaganda campaign that the contemporary leadership were
able to effectively blame Emma for Jo and Hyrum’s deaths. As Val and
Linda put it in Mormon Enigma, albeit in very gentle terms:

> Details of Emma’s role in events during the next few days \[June
> 12-28\] are critical to understanding later accusations leveled at
> her. When Brigham Young and other leaders tried to reconstruct this
> period, they relied on reminiscences in which Emma’s actions were
> often interpreted unfavorably.

I find Val and Linda are too generous to LDS leadership here, possibly
owing to their belief in the church. Brigham and LDS leadership outright
lied about Emma’s role in order to vilify and blame her for the
assassinations. These deliberate and calculated lies about her actions
cloud the historical record and make it very challenging to determine
fact from propaganda to minimize the role and power of the RLDS church
during Bloody Brigham’s reign.

Emma has been blamed by members of the LDS church for the deaths of Jo
and Hyrum. This has all been done as a result of a smear campaign begun
by Bloody Brigham and the SLC leadership. As Linda and Val describe
throughout chapter 13, Emma was relatively calm and resolved in her own
actions and she followed the instructions of her husband. Yes, Emma sent
the letter to Jo across the Mississippi when he was in hiding urging him
to return, but Emma’s letter was carried by Jo’s friends who called him
a coward. That charge of cowardice is what Val and Linda claim was the
turning point for Jo, but sending the letter to Jo telling him to come
back isn’t the only thing Emma did that church leaders have used to
vilify Emma. Further clarification follows through Chapter 13 of Mormon
Enigma. Jo’s original arrest on charges of riot led to his first hearing
in the Nauvoo Municipal court which discharged the prisoners. Jo held
his military parade and gave his final public speech to the Mormons. Val
and Linda pick up from there.

Emma had developed a formula out of necessity for dealing with herself,
her husband, and her children during times of crisis. From Jo being
attacked, beaten, tarred and feathered in 1832, resulting in the death
of one of their adopted children, to multiple times in both Missouri and
Illinois that authorities called on her residence asking for the prophet
to arrest him, Emma’s ability to cope in these situations held the
family together and often kept Jo out of the custody of the state. Yes,
Jo had a group of bodyguards lurking in the shadows, but not every
situation called for their hammer-and-nail approach to dealing with
problems. Sometimes, the careful and precise wit of Emma was exactly
what was needed to keep the prophet safe.

After the first hearing in the Nauvoo Municipal court, Jo sent for Judge
Thomas to give some guidance as to how to proceed, who told him to hold
another hearing in front of somebody not connected with the church,
which Jo eventually did hold the second hearing in front of Daniel H.
Wells. Wells wasn’t a member of the church technically, but he’d go on
to lead some of the most crucial massacres in the Utah Territory
commanding his company of Nauvoo Legionnaires. How that information
reached Jo has been a source of character assassination against Emma,
although the conflict seems to have arisen more out of confusion and
seems far from deliberate on Emma’s part.

Emma not delivering this letter from Judge Thomas to Jo has been a
source of controversy which helped the SLC leadership pin his death on
Emma. It was Judge Thomas’s letter that told Jo that the first hearing
wasn’t good enough which caused them to hold the second hearing before
Daniel H. Wells and it was this second letter which told Jo to just give
himself up, which he didn’t do for another 5 days after receiving it.
Whether or not he read the letter, and whether or not Emma gave him the
letter, is a matter of conjecture, which means it’s one ambiguity in the
weeks between the Expositor destruction and Carthage the SLC leadership
used to vilify Emma.

Another action of Emma’s used to vilify her is an issue with the horses.
Jo and Hyrum wanted their horses brought to them by Pistol Packin’
Porter when they were in hiding across the Mississippi and refusing
Governor Ford’s orders to surrender. They wanted their horses so they
could begin their journey across the plains to Mexico on the other side
of the Rockies with the Mormons soon to follow. Continuing in Mormon
Enigma from page 186:

> Not long after Rockwell left Emma’s door, Stephen Markham came and
> explained that Joseph wanted him to dismiss the Legion before dawn so

> When he threatened to chop the door down Emma told him, “You may go

> horses.”

Jo had also sent order to Emma that she was to depart for Ohio and head
for Washington D.C. Whether he would join his wife in meeting with the
president or expected her to meet with president John Tyler on his
behalf while he and Hyrum were crossing the plains towards Mexico is
still a matter of historical controversy. He expected her answer to his
order that same night while the remaining leadership in Nauvoo were
weighing the balance of Jo turning himself in with what might happen if
he didn’t.

From these later reminiscences, accusations were drawn up by the SLC
leadership that Emma’s success in “prevail\[ing\] on \[Joseph\] to
return” was what caused his martyrdom. The message was placed in the
hands of Porter Rockwell who found Jo and Hyrum across the river in
Montrose, Iowa territory.

It wasn’t Emma’s letter that convinced Jo to return, it was Hiram
Kimball and Reynolds Cahoon calling him a coward and Hyrum telling Jo
they should see this thing out that caused Jo to return. It’s only a
myth that Emma was responsible for convincing Jo to return, although her
words in the letter probably did go some distance in convincing him. She
doesn’t bear the responsibility any more than Hiram Kimball, Reynolds
Cahoon, and Hyrum Smith. Besides, it was Jo’s actions which led to this
whole situation anyway, we can never forget that.

Now, to the final myth Emma is accused of for being responsible for Jo’s
death, the garments. It has long been circulated that Emma convinced Jo
to remove his endowment garments before departing for Carthage, which
would have protected him when the mob attacked if he had them on. This
is plain stupid for two reasons. First, the endowment garments at the
time were only worn during the ceremony itself, not outside it. Mormon
wearing their sacred garments 24/7 is a construct of SLC Mormonism and
was never the practice during Jo’s life. Second reason this is stupid,
cloth underwear doesn’t do anything to stop a bullet because, and I
can’t emphasize this enough, they aren’t magic or made from Kevlar\!
Linda and Val dismantle this argument from top to bottom in one short
paragraph in Mormon Enigma:

> Brigham Young later alleged that Emma had Joseph remove his “garment
> of the priesthood” before going to Carthage to give himself up the
> next morning. Since these garments, worn by all the members of the

It took more than a year for the Apostles to inculcate into the members
minds the propaganda that they were supposed to wear their endowment
garments at all times and that Jo wasn’t wearing his because of Emma
when he died in Carthage. They were deliberate lies and rewriting of
history as it was more than a year from everybody’s memories when the
propaganda was crafted. Bloody Brigham is a terrible human being and
Emma was his punching bag. The LDS Church has treated her as the cause
of Jo’s death for multiple reasons for over a century and a half because
Bloody Brigham lied. He lied about everything and he did it only to
serve his own interests.

It was paramount for Brigham to minimize Emma and elevate his own
authority, especially when we consider what happened when Jo returned to
Nauvoo with his friends and said a final goodbye to his family the day
before he surrendered to Governor Ford that same night at 5 minutes to
midnight on June 24<sup>th</sup>. From Mormon Enigma, Linda and Val take
a moment to describe the entire Smith family.

> and set apart, and will in time succeed me.”

One of Jo’s final acts before leaving Nauvoo for Carthage the last time
was to set apart Joseph III as his rightful successor. This does away
with any other claims to authority made by the SLC church, Hingepin
Rigdon, the Whitmers, James Strang, or anybody else claiming authority
from Jo. Joseph III in every way was Jo’s rightful successor and only 3
days before Jo was dead in Carthage he sealed that blessing on Joseph
III’s head in a room full of witnesses who largely followed Joseph III
when he formed the Reorganized church (RLDS) in 1860.

To magnify how much Emma loved her husband and did everything in her
power to keep him safe when she could; how much she loved her family,
and how much she loved her personal god, permit me one more reading
today to round out the episode as the last communication Emma sent to
her husband after he’d been committed to Carthage Jail on charges of
treason. This is a crucial letter known as “these desires of my heart,”
written the night Jo was riding to Carthage to surrender at 5 minutes to
midnight.

Emma had no way of knowing this would be her last letter to her husband.
She had no idea what the future held. She had no idea of how to keep the
Mormon settlement in control as thousands of people cast their eyes
toward her to be the mouthpiece of her husband in his absence. Emma had
no way of controlling the overt and deliberate character assassination
she suffered after his death. This letter is a testament to her wisdom
in that only the wise will pray to their god earnestly asking for such
broad swaths of wisdom in return. We can’t control what happened to
Emma’s legacy after her death, but we can be appreciative to
revisionist historians like Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippets Avery
who worked tirelessly for years to write a biography that did the
complicated enigma that is Emma Hale Smith the justice her life actually
deserved. My first episode talking about Emma was titled Blushing Bride,
Mafia Wife. I had no idea what I was talking about. But I supplicated at
the altar of Mormon history academia and the endowments of wisdom were
granted thanks to these wonderful scholars.

But what about Emma? She, like everybody else thought Jo would get out
of this scrape with the law like he had every other scrape before. She
thought his departure from Nauvoo to Carthage would result in his
victorious return having one yet another legal battle and the Smith
family would continue to build the Kingdom on the Mississippi until the
stone could roll forth and fill the whole earth. I can’t help but wonder
when studying various figures in Nauvoo history whether they truly
believed or not. It’s never a simple question. What we do know is Emma
fought and struggled with some doctrines more than others. She had a
history of dealing with Jo’s sexual indiscretions their entire married
life so a revelation claiming polygyny was required for salvation
couldn’t have struck her as anything more than a plot to stop her
incessant complaints to her husband. However, she also witnessed the
authorship process of the Book of Mormon and her public statements,
including her death bed confession, reveal the claimed narrative as
accurate. Also notable is that for her entire life, all her financial
and social success, including becoming one of the wealthiest women in
America for a brief time, were predicated on sticking to the story Jo
had crafted. Even after Jo’s death, her reliance on the Book of Mormon
as scripture was absolutely necessary for her eldest son, Joseph III, to
retain credibility as the rightful heir his father had ordained him to
be. We know she lied about polygamy. We know she lied by using codewords
and outright lied to her own son on her deathbed when her son remembers
calling Eliza R. Snow aunt Eliza when Eliza lived in the Nauvoo Mansion
with the Smiths. The simple fact is, it’s impossible to nail down
exactly what Emma was, what she truly believed, and what secrets she
carried with her to her grave. In that regard, Val and Linda chose the
perfect title for Emma’s seminal biography as Emma truly is the Mormon
Enigma.

Upcoming GBP interview about this book, we’re working out the details
for a panel of historians during the New Mormon history era.

Coming soon on GBP as well, an interview about Ezra Benson, who was
influential in shaping Mormon politics as an apostle and was prophet for
many of the years historians were doing their research.
