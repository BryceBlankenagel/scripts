Joseph and Hyrum Smith are in Carthage jail. They aren’t going anywhere,
not alive anyway. We spent last week catching up with Emma and seeing
her role in the preceding events which landed her husband and
brother-in-law in the jail. I want to spend a bit of time with some
other inferior folks of the timeline to see what it is they’ve been up
to lately as these tensions brewed between the Nauvoo Mormons and the
Carthage anti-Mormons. When I say inferior, I just mean they’re
perceived as less influential or crucial to the timeline and therefore
have far less information written about them. This episode will kind of
be all over the place but hang in there with me because there are quite
a few threads to tie together into June of 1844.

I want to start with one of my personal favorites in Nauvoo history for
complicated reasons, Eliza R. Snow. She’s kind of my personal crush, I
better not get into it, but Eliza had a pretty busy 1844. Emma and Eliza
had some form of altercation; we talked about it on Emma’s Stairway to
Hell. Accounts differ but historians generally agree that something did
occur. Immediately after the altercation, Eliza moved out of the Nauvoo
Homestead where she was living with her husband and sister-wives. Where
she moved was the Morley Settlement, known as Yelrom, because Mormons
are super basic with codenames. This was run as a communalistic
settlement by Father Isaac Morley, one of the earliest converts to the
church in 1830 who lived near Kirtland, Ohio. The Morley settlements in
Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois were always a place of refuge for
struggling and destitute Mormons who didn’t have somewhere else to call
home. Even the Smith family, including Jo and Emma, lived on the Morley
settlement in Ohio when the first got there in early 1831.

Eliza had moved into the Nauvoo Homestead with the Smiths and considered
it home, but with the raging conflict between her and Emma, no place
where they shared the same roof would be a peaceful home. Moving to the
Morley settlement, named Yelrom, probably in mid-1843, was the best
option to keep the peace between sister-wives. Well, Eliza Snow lived
out the remainder of 1843 through to April of 1844 on the Morley
Settlement. Yelrom wasn’t spectacular living conditions, but it had
roofs and beds to lay ones head at night. Typically, the folks who lived
on the Morley settlement were people who were down and out, or families
whose husband was on a mission, or were sealed to Isaac as his wives and
celestial family. Eliza fell into that category after she was violently
removed from the Smith homestead. She didn’t have many options available
to her and settling into one of the communal cabins in Yelrom seemed her
best option. Yelrom, however, was about 30 miles south of Nauvoo with
Warsaw and Carthage right between the two.

Eliza’s calling as secretary of the Relief Society went on hold when she
moved to Yelrom. When that happened, a woman named Phebe M. Wheeler took
over the scribal duties from Eliza. Emma also didn’t attend another
Relief Society meeting for the rest of the year after Eliza was kicked
out. Every absence is noted by both Emma and her councilors from July to
October of 1843, before the Relief Society went on hiatus for the winter
until March of 1844. Many times it notes that Emma was sick and requests
the society to pray for her but others simply note that she wasn’t
there. It wasn’t just Emma who was gone from the RS meetings for the
latter half of 1843, Eliza Snow was absent as well. Phebe Wheeler took
the RS notes for the rest of the year with a very brief meeting in
September when an unidentified scribe took the notes for the morning
meeting in black ink instead of blue ink that fills the other pages.

Eliza can be tracked through her journal and poems in Nauvoo. Eliza was
“politely presented” an empty notebook by a friend of hers by the name
of Sarah Melissa Kimball sometime in March 1842. Paper, let alone an
entire empty notebook, was a gracious and costly gift for Sarah to give
Eliza when used for unofficial purposes. White-out Willard Richards had
provided Eliza with an empty notebook for the Relief Society Minutes, so
this small notebook, according to Maureen Ursenbach Beecher, Eliza’s
biographer, “so this \[notebook\] lay unused for three months”. The
first entry is marked for 29 June 1842, the day Eliza married Joseph,
which can only be inferred by decoding her coded language which clouds
the history of polygamy.

Maureen Beecher expresses the struggle for historians in decoding this
language as representative of the struggle of Eliza to properly record
her thoughts on that momentous day. A link to Beecher’s edited version
of Eliza’s Nauvoo Journal is in the show notes.

> The first entry in the new book is dated 29 June 1842. Written in a
> manner far removed from the concise, direct style of Eliza’s usual
> prose, it seems to be struggling to express feelings without
> disclosing the events which precipitated those feelings. “This is a
> day of much interest to my feelings,” Eliza begins, and wanders off
> into vague references to her family and their plans for moving.

When we understand the context of Eliza’s recent life-changing event
when the first entry was recorded, it seems as if she was what we’d call
today body and sex positive. Let me read it and try to listen to this
first entry with the understanding that Nauvoo Mormonism was in the
process of evolving into a free-love community and Eliza had just been
inducted into that inner community within a community. She also provides
a few signals that her worldview was perceived through the esoteric art
of numerology.

> This is a day of much interest to my feelings. Reflecting on past
> occurrences, a variety of thoughts have presented themselves to my
> mind with regard to events which have chas’d each other in rapid
> succession in the scenery of human life.
> 
> As an individual, I have not passed altogether unnoticed by Change, in
> reference to present circumstances and future prospects. Two weeks and
> two days have pass’d since an intimation was presented of my duty and
> privilege of remaining in the City of the saints in case of the
> removal of my father’s family: one week and two days have transpired
> since the family left, and though I rejoice in the blessing of the
> society of the saints, and the approbation of God; a lonely feeling
> will steal over me before I am aware, while I am contemplating the
> present state of society—the powers of darkness, and the prejudices of
> the human mind which stand array’d like and impregnable barrier
> against the work of God. While these thoughts were revolving in my
> mind, the heavens became shadowed with clouds and a heavy shower of
> rain and hail ensued, and I exclaim’d “O God, is it not enough that we
> have the prepossessions of mankind—their prejudices and their hatred
> to contend with; but must we also stand amid the rage of elements?” I
> concluded within myself that the period might not be far distant, that
> will require faith to do so; but the grace of God is sufficient,
> therefore I will not fear. I will put my trust in Him who is mighty to
> save; rejoicing in his goodness and determin’d to live by every word
> that proceedeth out of his mouth.

Another entry from August of 1842 reveals some conflict within the New
and Everlasting Covenant Eliza had recently been inducted into. Eliza
tells us that Emma called on her to move into the Nauvoo Homestead,
which provided some conflict between her and her sister-wife, Sarah
Cleveland, Emma and Eliza’s newest sister-wife and councilor in the
Relief Society.

> Mrs. \[Sarah\] Cleveland having come to the determination of moving on
> to her lot; my former expectations were frustrated, but the Lord has
> opened the path to my feet, and I feel dispos’d to acknowledge his
> hand in all things. This sudden, unexpected change in my location, I
> trust is for good; it seem’d to come in answer to my petitions to God
> to direct me in the path of duty according to his will.

This is when Eliza moved into the Homestead with her sister-wives. While
there she taught school, helped Emma and the others in the Relief
Society presidency with sundry other affairs, and continued to wax
poetic whenever occasion demanded. Her journal includes poem after poem
interspersed among her various entries. We’ve read a few on the show
before when they capture a certain emotion of specific subject matter;
her poems convey feelings conveyed in no other journal entry of the
time. She also composed poems as commissions for friends who lost a
family member or child. One of these was written for an elder Lorenzo
Barnes who died on a mission in Bradford, England in December of 1842.
She also recounts the return of her older brother, Lorenzo Snow, when he
arrived in Nauvoo from his mission with the Quorum of Apostles in
England.

> Wednesday 12 \[April 1843\]
> 
> This day I have the inexpressible happiness of once again embracing a
> brother who had been absent nearly three years. I cannot describe the
> feelings which fill’d my bosom when I saw the steam-boat Amaranth
> moving majestically up the Mississippi, and thought perhaps Lorenzo
> was on board: my heart overflowed with gratitude when, after the
> landing of the boat, I heard Prest. Hiram Smith say to me “your
> brother has actually arrived.” It is a time of mutual rejoicing which
> I never shall forget.

Eliza didn’t feel up to the task of telling Lorenzo she’d found a nice
man her age to marry, and instead told her husband to teach Lorenzo
about the New and Everlasting Covenant. Lorenzo wouldn’t take his own
polygamous wives until October 1844, 4 months after Jo and Hyrum died in
Carthage. 6 of his 9 wives by the time of his death in 1901 were
teenagers when he married them. Lorenzo was apparently opposed to
celestial marriage initially but he clearly got over it pretty quickly
once he aligned with the Brighamite faction coming out of the schism
crisis.

Eilza continues entries throughout her journal for 1843. She spent some
months writing nearly daily, while other entries span weeks or months
after the previous. She notes every major event we’ve discussed on the
show, the mysterious death of Judge Elias Higbee, the arrest and ensuing
legal battle of Jo in Dixon, Illinois by Sheriffs Wilson and Reynolds,
bickering and drama from polygamy, her removal to Yelrom and the ensuing
feelings, perceived persecution from the legal system, the trial of
Hingepin Sidney Rigdon when Jo tried to excommunicate him and the High
Council refused, Eliza’s dream “that my father spoke to me of prospects
nineteen months to come,” and even Eliza’s Oct 1843 poem to Eliza
Partridge telling her to not be so depressed about the situation. Eliza
Snow’s journal truly is a remarkable artifact of Nauvoo and her writing
style provides only brief windows into the secretive nature of the
criminal empire of Nauvoo.

Notably as well, while Eliza Snow lived on the Morley settlement, on Dec
19<sup>th</sup> 1843 she received her patriarchal blessing from Isaac
Morley. In it, Isaac promises Eliza that “thy name shall be handed down
to posterity from generation to generation: and many songs shall be
heard that were dictated by thy pen and from the principles of thy mind,
even until the choirs from on high and the earth below, shall join in
one universal song of praise to God and the Lamb.” She doesn’t record
any of her own thoughts or feelings about the blessing but she’s kind
enough to reprint the blessing in its entirety in her journal.

Eliza Snow’s 1844 entries are unfortunately very light. She had one
entry for January, two for February, and one for April, marking her last
entry during her husband’s life. The entry from January and the first
entry of February are simply poems she wrote for friends who’d recently
lost their children; the first was “To Mrs. M\[ary Ann\] Pratt, on the
death of her little son,” while the second poem is to “Mrs. Lyons,”
whose daughter had also died in Yelrom.

Reading through her journal, Eliza R. Snow strikes me as quite the
optimist. Page after page talks about her good feelings and the grand
designs of Zion and the Lord’s plans. Her penultimate entry in 1844 come
from February 20<sup>th</sup>, 1844, which talks about her attending a
prayer meeting in Lima, the next village north of Yelrom, where she was
living. I’ve long speculated that psychedelics were involved in these
prayer meetings, particularly on the various Morley settlements in both
Ohio and Illinois. Anybody with personal experience with psychedelics
will see why I see Eliza Snow as a proto-free-love psychonaut hippie
when we see stuff like this:

> Spent last evening much to my satisfaction, entertainment and
> instruction, at a Blessing meeting at br. Beeby’s in Lima. It was
> quite a treat to my mind—one of the bright spots on the page of my
> life never to be forgotten.

Todd Compton’s In Sacred Loneliness details numerous of these prayer and
blessing meetings. “On New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1843, \[Eliza\]
wrote, “A social circle of a few choice friends convened at the house of
our sister, and we had a lovely time,” a meeting that probably included
tongues and prophecy.” Another passage from Eliza’s journal in October
1843 reads “Some circumstances of very peculiar interest occur’d during
my visit to the City. Every thing connected with our *affections* is
engraven on the heart, and needs not the perpetuating touch of the
sculptor.” These prayer meetings weren’t just held in Kirtland and
Nauvoo, but all across the plains and in Utah; Eliza’s path can be
traced by these prayer meetings with her best friends who were largely
the sisters in the Relief Society presidency in Nauvoo and Utah.

Eliza’s role as Relief Society secretary would never be filled by her
again after her ouster from Nauvoo and relocation to Yelrom in mid-1843.
The women who took over the role were Phebe M. Wheeler, and unidentified
scribe for a single meeting, and Hannah Ells, who was the scribe for the
final meeting of the RS in Nauvoo before the schism crisis. For this
period from mid-1843 to mid-1844, Eliza Snow becomes a bit of a
mysterious figure. She did, however, continue to write poems when daily
entries in her journal wouldn’t do proper justice. Many of these poems
were initially written in her journal, or transcribed from being written
somewhere else. Many of them were printed in the Wasp or the Nauvoo
Neighbor, others weren’t published until the Utah era during the Mormon
Reformation era. The final poem Eliza wrote before the assassinations of
her husband and Hyrum was a few short lines to Lauran Miranda and Emily
Matilda Hyde

Fair little misses, always do

As your fond mother teaches you,

And you shall both, your brother meet

And fill his cheeks with kisses sweet.

Be to each other very kind

With useful studies store your mind

To God our Father bow the knee,

And when you pray, remember me.

Composed 2 June 1844.

The rest of Eliza’s poems reveal her personal struggles, as well as
those of all the saints, with the deaths of Jo and Hyrum. We’ll save
those for a later time.

Let’s catch up with the Quorum of Apostles. Back in the March 21, 1844
meeting of the Council of Fifty, Jo and the leadership were developing
his Presidential campaign. Folks needed to be dispatched across America
to spread the good word of how great a candidate Jo was. Accordingly,

> Prest. J. Smith recommended that the Twelve should select men from the
> Quorums of the seventies and High Priests and send them to preach and
> electioneer through the different States, and then as many of the
> Twelve as can, follow these Elders and hold conferences in the various
> branches of the Church through the States.

The role of the Quorum of Apostles in Jo’s church is largely different
than the apostles today. Today’s apostles in the SLC church are tasked
with running the church, sitting on boards, directing the actions of the
Quorums of Seventies, the middle managers, and various other
administrative duties. However, in Jo’s church they were mostly
permanent missionaries. They carried with them the weight of the
presidency of the church in that they could baptize people, organize
branches, wards, and stakes, ordain local leaders to organize those
congregations, and preside over meetings wherever they went. The role of
the Apostles developed out of necessity in Utah to become the
administrative body it is today.

During the earliest meetings of the Council of Fifty, they were drafting
their own constitution, Double-dub Phelps was writing Jo’s campaign
platform, and the members were constantly deliberating on who the VP
nominee should be until they finally settled on Hingepin Sidney Rigdon.
He was super-interested in building the Mormon theocracy. As much as his
public presence in the church has been minimized in the historical
record, he was an acting and active member of the Council of Fifty. In
the March 21<sup>st</sup> meeting he “made some lengthy and animated
remarks on various subjects particularly on the situation of Texas & her
position in regard to other nations.” During the next meeting on March
26<sup>th</sup>, “He entered into the subject \[of the kingdom of God\]
in a most spirited & animated manner, showing the glory and joy which
will exist when God reigns over the nation, when oppression shall cease,
and the righteous enjoy the blessings of the kingdom.” In the April
4<sup>th</sup> meeting, Rigdon “referred largely to the anticipations of
the Ancients respecting the glories of the days in which we live,
showing that the Angels had joy in heaven when before the creation they
looked down and saw the privileges we enjoy in this organization”. He
went on to further articulate the importance of the Native Americans in
the Mormon theocracy building campaign when he “was speaking \[of\]
eleven of the Potawottamie tribe of Indians attended by a French
Interpreter appeared & were admitted into the council. They made known
that they were friendly to the Mormon people, and wanted their influence
They had been oppressed by the U.S. government and did not want to sell
them any more land.” Rigdon brought this fury into the public preaching
when he gave a sermon for the church on April 6<sup>th</sup>, 1844,
during general conference when Jo gave his famed King Follett Discourse.
During this speech, Rigdon stated “When God sets up a system of
salvation, he sets up a system of government; when I speak of a
government I mean what I say; I mean a government that shall rule over
temporal and spiritual affairs.”

Bloody Brigham Young echoed these sentiments 3 days later in a public
speech when he said “that there was no dividing line between the Govt of
God & the Govt of the Children of men… that the Govm. belongs to God.”
These were common sentiments of those who were in the Council of Fifty,
it was to be the theocratic kingdom of the world, the last government
the world would ever need. The Council and Quorum of Apostles shifted
their efforts to being an effective campaign team for Joseph Smith. The
presidency of the United States was only the beginning and it was a good
place to start. The Joseph Smith Papers has an editorial note on their
transcription of the Council of Fifty minutes that says “By mid-April
nearly 350 men, including many members of the council, had been given
assignments to campaign throughout the United States.” This same meeting
of the Council of Fifty that is preceded by this editorial note happened
on April 25<sup>th</sup>, 1844, when the Council voted and received by
unanimous consent the new constitution of the Mormon theocracy. The next
meeting on May 3<sup>rd</sup>, Jo took the stand:

> \[Joseph Smith\] wanted Elder \[Lyman\] Wight and every other man who
> could leave, to go into all the States and preach and electioneer for
> him to be president. And when he is president we can send out
> ministers plenipotentiary, who will secure to themselves such
> influence that when their office shall cease they may be received into
> everlasting habitations, but we should never indulge our appetites to
> injure our influence, or wound the feelings of friends, or cause the
> spirit of the Lord to leave us…” Jo “concluded by remarking that it is
> best to run on a long race and be careful to keep good wind \&c.

The men took Jo’s suggestions seriously and after the following meeting
just 3 days later, many concluded to take their various directions
across the nation to electioneer for Jo and meet with other powerful men
to tell them how good a candidate Jo was. It was also during this May
6<sup>th</sup> meeting that the council devised a plan for settlement of
various members of the council and Quorum of Apostles.

Lucian Woodworth, George Miller, and Lyman Wight were tasked with
meeting Texas president Sam Houston, Hingepin Sidney Rigdon “consented
to run for the vice precidency if the council wished” and was sent to
his old stomping grounds of Pennsylvania to electioneer and get the
votes for Jo as president from that state, Almon Babbitt was appointed
to go on a mission to either France or Russia, “or some other popular
Kingdom”. All these were exciting moves for the Council of Fifty and the
men were quite ambitious.

> “Er \[Lyman\] Wight reminded Er Rigdon of a certain prophecy, and that
> the Lord promised to vex the nations and the nation could not be vexed
> worse than for Joseph to be president and brother Rigdon vice
> President.”

I’m not sure if that was an endorsement or a harbinger of how bad they’d
be at their jobs because it could honestly go either way. Regardless,
“Er Rigdon referred to a former prophecy and said I am satisfied God
intends to do just what we are doing” which was followed with “The
chairman \[Joseph Smith\] confirmed it.” Rigdon had conditions to
running as VP. “Er Rigdon asked the privilege,--after Joseph had been
President 4 years, that he should be president the next term which was
granted, and he stated that as the Lord God lives Joseph shall be
President next term and I will follow him”. This clearly reveals that
once Jo was elected President the Council of Fifty never intended to
have another presidential election.

These men were all sent in their various directions to electioneer, with
some of them carrying the Mormon memorial to Congress in DC which
declared Nauvoo as a sovereign territory and petitioned Congress for
100,000 volunteers to liberate Oregon territory.

Concomitant with all these political maneuvers was the dissenting group
forming their own religion inside Nauvoo and shipping their own printing
press into the city. These dissenters were the Higbees, Fosters, and
Laws, who named William Law as president of the True COJCOLDS and
printed the Nauvoo Expositor. Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, Lucian Woodworth,
Uncle John Smith, and some of the other Council of Fifty members all
confronted the Laws, Fosters, and Higbees about their new church and
what they planned on printing with their shiny, new press. William Law
responded to Rigdon that “he would set up a press and go it to the death
to get satisfaction”.

Bloody Brigham Young recounts this time in his manuscript history of
this time period. He notes the General Conference in April 1844 where Jo
gave his King Follett Discourse and Rigdon said that they were setting
up the last government the world would ever need. In his history,
Brigham says “The Prophet declared that all North and South America was
the land of Zion. At the close of the conference 344 elders volunteered
to go on missions.” Brigham himself was joined on a brief expedition to
the Morley Settlement near Lima by Wilford Woodruff, they both preached
and got another 26 volunteers for the Mormon propaganda campaign.
Brigham also talks about the lawsuit against Francis M. Higbee by Joseph
Smith where Brigham was called in to testify right before he and the
rest of the Quorum of Apostles left Nauvoo for their various missions
along with the other 350+ volunteers.

Bloody Brigham departed on May 21, 1844 and details his journey through
St. Louis where he preached to “about 700 members”… but here I thought
it was illegal to be a Mormon in Missouri since the Extermination Order…
Brigham also preached on board the steamer they took for Cincinnati to
“allay… some prejudice which had been manifested against the elders on
board.” Brigham wasn’t alone during these parts of the journey. He lists
Lyman Wight, Heber the Creeper Kimball, Franklin D. Richards, Lester
Brooks (I’m not sure who that is), and a few others. They went through
Pittsburgh and attended various meetings before they passed through Old
Britain, Warren, and Akron on their way to Kirtland, the old HQ of the
church. When they passed through Akron they attended an abolition
convention, and Brigham describes the folks there, “some of whom
manifested a spirit to put down everybody but themselves.” When, those
folks did kind of win the war and got their way so hooray for them being
on the right side of history.

Once in Kirtland, Bloody Brigham found his brother John Young and his
sister Nancy Kent. The very next day after his arrival he preached in
the Kirtland Temple, in the possession of a breakoff faction of the
church at the time. “I lectured in the evening on the subject of the
location of Nauvoo; the Saints were dead and cold to the things of God.”
Oh how the salt has lost it’s savor, amiright brother Brigham? He also
preached briefly in “Hiram \[OH\] and held a meeting in sight of the
house where Joseph and Sidney were dragged out by the heels and tarred
and feathered.”

From there, Brigham and Franklin Richards proceeded to Chester to visit
Brigham’s sister and spend the night at “Brother Butler’s”. I assume
that’s John L. Butler but I can’t seem to verify that. From thence,
Brigham and company went to Fairport and took a steamer to Buffalo
“where we arrived on the morning of \[June\] 13<sup>th</sup>, and went
by railcars to Albany, and from thence by steamboat to New York, and
proceeded to Boston, where I arrived on the morning of Sunday
16<sup>th</sup>.

During that small window of traveling from Kirtland to Boston over
exactly 7 days, the Nauvoo Expositor had been published, the city
council had met and resolved to destroy the press and it had been
burned, Justice Morrison had sworn out the arrest warrant against Jo and
the 17 other men, they held their first sham trial, they received word
from Judge Thomas that the first hearing wasn’t good enough so they held
the second hearing in front of Daniel H. Wells, the Warsaw Signal had
called for a war of extermination, the gathering militia forces in
Carthage were somewhere around 500 men, and to Governor of Illinois was
en route to Carthage to handle matters personally. Over the next few
days Brigham dallied about Lowell, Salem, Boston, and the local smaller
cities without any inkling that Nauvoo and Carthage were on the literal
precipice of war. It wasn’t just Brigham out and about because George A.
Smith was in Peterborough, New Hampshire, John E. Page was in
Pittsburgh, Heber the Creeper Kimball was in Washington D.C. with Orson
Pratt, Wilford Woodruff was in Portage, New York, Crazy Willey Smith,
Jo’s youngest surviving brother, was in Philedelphia with Orson Hyde,
George Miller was in Richmond, Kentucky, P-cubed Parley P. Pratt was in
New York City, and Amasa Lyman was in Cincinnati. All of these men were
members of the Council of Fifty and electioneering for Jo’s presidential
campaign while Nauvoo was gearing up for the next Mormon war and Jo was
in hiding from arrest and extradition to Carthage. Brigham wouldn’t hear
rumors of Jo and Hyrum’s deaths until July 9<sup>th</sup>, more than a
week and a half after it happened. He wouldn’t receive confirmation
until July 16<sup>th</sup> when he brought his “hand down on my knee,”
and infamously declared “the keys of the kingdom are right here with the
Church” and began his vicious power grab game.

Lucy Mack Smith has been a figure lurking largely in the shadows of our
historical timeline since the death of her husband, Big Daddy Cheese Jo
Smith Sr., in September of 1840. She’s only come up twice I can recall
since then. The first is when we were talking about the Book of Abraham
and she told some Quaker reporters in the late 1840s that Jo translated
the Egyptian Papyri using precious and Mr. Hat, the little seer stone
and stovepipe hat trick. The last time she came up was when Jane Manning
James moved into the Nauvoo Mansion where Lucy had her own room. Jane
came into the room where Lucy was sitting and Lucy told Jane to go to a
cabinet and open the top drawer where Jane first saw the papyri and seer
stone Jo used to translate it. I’ve mentioned her a few other times but
Lucy has largely remained in the backstage of our timeline in Nauvoo.
The primary reason for that is she just didn’t do much other than paint
rugs and sew for income when she was feeling up to it. Lucy has been ill
for the majority of the timeline. She attended various Relief Society
meetings though.

Lucy spoke at the April 19<sup>th</sup>, 1842 meeting, just 18 months
after her husband of 44 years had died, and it is equally tragic and
revealing of her situation.

> Mother Smith spoke very pathetically of her lonely situation, and the
> feelings she had as she reflected on the care which Father Smith
> always felt for the sisters when in life he presided over the
> meetings.

Lucy was, however, even in her sickness and mourning, a strong exhorter
of the faith. During the March 31<sup>st</sup> RS meeting she spoke at
length.

> Mother Smith rose and said she was glad the time had come that
> iniquity could be detected and reproach thrown off from the heads of
> the church—we come into the church to be sav’d—that we may live in
> peace and sit down in the kingdom of heaven—If we listen to, and
> circulate every evil report we shall idly spend the time which should
> be appropriated to the reading the Scriptures, the Book of Mormon—we
> must remember the words of Alma—pray much at morning, noon and
> night—feed the poor \&c.—She said she was old—could not meet with
> the Society but few times more—and wish’d to leave her testimony that
> the Book of Mormon is the book of God—that Joseph is a man of God, a
> prophet of the Lord set apart to lead the people \[and he’s just the
> nicest boy any of you lovely women will ever meet\!\] If we observe
> his words it will be well with us; if we live righteously on earth, it
> will be well with us in Eternity—

Lucy had it rough as a widow, but she always had family who cared for
her. She recounts a story from back in 1841 about injuring her knee but
being attended to by her daughters Sophronia and Lucy.

> In the winter I went to bear creek on a visit to Brother S\[idney\] A
> Knowltons when I arrived there it was dark and I was very cold and in
> getting out of the waggon stepped upon some round substance which
> rolling under my foot brought my round so sudenly that in trying to

> the injured part and the rheumatism set in I suffered considerable

> ever night \<Sophronia Smith McCleary\> and Lucy \[Smith Millikin\]
> took care of me and faithfully did they watch over me never was a
> disconsolate widow more blessed in her children than I was in them

Even though Lucy was often times hold up in bed with sickness and
arthritis, she still saw everything which transpired. She recounts “some
assasin attempted to shoot Liburn Bogs governor of Misouri. In a trice
the cry went forth that Joe Smith had shot Gov Bogs”. But, she tells
that Jo was preaching to “some 4 or 5 thousand persons the day previous
and was at a public training the same day” so obviously her little angel
never would have shot that rotten old Governor Boggs. She then goes on
to tell her side of Jo getting arrested in Dixon, Illinois by Sheriffs
Wilson and Reynolds in July 1843.

> They remained untill the next summer and then made the intended visit

Lucy discusses the time following this arrest as a brief era of good
feelings about Nauvoo, at least from her vantage point.

Lucy goes on to tell about a scoundrel of a man who joined the movement
in Nauvoo, Joseph H. Jackson. She includes accusations against Jackson
that aren’t present basically anywhere else but sure are interesting.
Listeners to the patreon exclusive feed get to hear the audiobook
version of his expose with my commentary. Patreon.com/nakedmormonism.
Here’s what Lucy says about Jackson:

> about this \[time?\] a man by the name of Joseph Jackson who had been
> several months in the place asked Hyrum for his daughter Lovina for he
> wished to make a wif of her\[.\] Hyrum not choosing to have his
> daughter marry a man who did not belong to the church refused for this
> and other reasons to give her to him\[.\] this Jackson then asked
> Joseph to his influence with Hyrum to get the girl for him Joseph
> refusing to do so Jackson went to Law to get his assistance in
> stealing Lovina from her father\[.\] Hyrum heard of this and \<came to
> me several times for advice\> he said he was alarmed about her that he
> felt worse than he did when he was in prison—Jackson went from one to
> another wherever he could learn that any one had any feeling against
> our family\[.\] \[He held\] secret \[meetings\] till finally he
> succceeded in getting a number to join in a conspiracy to Murder the
> whole Smith family\[.\]

Jackson’s role in Nauvoo is one full of adventure and disinformation
making the truth pretty hard to tease out. Jackson claimed he refused to
be married to anybody in Nauvoo as it would frustrate his plans of
espionage of the criminal empire, even though Jo took Jackson around to
the various brothels and offered plenty of women to Jackson to marry.
But then we have Lucy claiming that the troubles with Jackson started
because Jackson wanted Hyrum’s daughter and planned to kidnap her, which
seems very believable considering the guy. Then Lucy pins this
disagreement as the cause for the trouble with Jackson and the printers
of the Nauvoo Expositor, which is kind of putting the cart before the
horse and missing out on the conflict between the Expositor printers and
Jackson to begin with.

Lucy’s version of the growing conflict with the Expositor publishers and
Jackson against her sons shows to us how much they were able to keep all
these things secret and hide the drama and chaos of polygamy and
theocracy-building from, not only the standard Mormon public, but even
from their own mother who lived in Jo’s house and was best friends with
Emma who knew a lot about what was going on. If they could keep this
stuff under wraps from their own mom, they could obviously keep it
hidden from the larger Mormon public, which is why the Expositor was
such a bombshell when it was published.

She also talks about Charles Foster pointing a pistol at Jo in broad
daylight and then says “Joseph caught his hands and prevented him and
was compelled to hold him in this way above an hour in order to preserve
his own life”. Another account says it was Pistol Packin’ Porter who
knocked the gun out of Charles Foster’s hands while yet another account
says it was Robert Foster who told his younger brother to put away the
piece. Jo having to hold down Charles for an hour is simply impossible.
It was maybe for a few minutes, if it even happened, and I can assure
you that Charles could breathe the entire time because he didn’t die
while crying out for his mom.

Lucy does, however, talk about the Expositor.

> the Apostates with Jackson at their head continued to gather strength
> untill finally they established a printing press in our midst through
> this organ the\[y\] belched forth the most intolerable & the blackest
> of lies that was ever palmed upon a community

She remembers the sequence of events more vaguely than the historical
record actually reveals. She was recounting these events months after
they happened while she was racked with grief having just lost 3 of her
sons, Hyrum, Joseph, and Samuel, who died a month after the Carthage
shootout.

The last pages of Lucy’s dictated memoir read as follows:

My sons knowing that the men by whom the Gov was suronded were sworn to
take their lives at first fled to Iawa but the pledged faith of the
state for their protection and Hyrum was inclined to come back as he
heard the Gov had threatened to burn the city if the prisoners were not
given up many of the brethren thought they ought to give themselves up
for trial—But Joseph if he went he should die however he was willing to
die for the…

And then there are pages missing. The next written line from Martha
Coray, who wrote as Lucy dictated, read “I have now given a history of
My life as far as I intend carrying it at this time.” That’s where the
record ends for that dictation session. She does add in the next session
that “all that \[I\] have writen is true and will stand forever yes it
will stand before God at that hour when \<it\> shall and great shall
appear to answer at his bar for the deeds done in the body whether they
be good or evil--\<Then and\> there will I Meet the persecutors of my
family who are the enemies of the church and declare with a voice that
shall penetrate the ears of every inteligence which shall be present on
that momentous occasion”.

For a mother who had lost 3 sons, survived her husband and all but one
of her sons who was the black sheep of the family anyway, the only
solace she took was in her ability to testify at the bar of judgment
after death against the people who persecuted her family and the church
her sons started. She would live another 11 years after this memoir was
completed, sickly, grieving, and cared for by her daughters and
daughter-in-law, Emma, until her death in Nauvoo in 1856.

When the Nauvoo Expositor was published, the authors were intentionally
vague. Because of sexual slander laws protecting men from public
exposure for adultery or assault, names of people involved in polygamy
were almost always obscured or redacted from exposes, even those which
were most critical of the church. The authors of these exposes feared
legal repercussions and insulated themselves from lawsuits by referring
only obliquely to details which may reveal who was at issue within the
given expose. The Expositor accomplished this by revealing only marginal
details of those caught up in polygamy, but a few passages from the
Expositor bear discussion here given the subject alluded to.

Speaking of how Jo and other practitioners of polygamy would mark and
acquire their prey, the Expositor reveals some troubles aspects of Jo’s
methodology. This is disgusting. This is ecclesiastical abuse for sexual
gratification of the Mormon elite. This may be uncomfortable for some to
hear. It’s also a long passage which centers around the lived experience
of two teenage girls we’ll discuss in a minute, so bear with me.

William Law, in the Nauvoo Expositor, is describing a pattern of sexual
predation which can never go unnoticed when studying Nauvoo and broader
religious polygamy history. Law successfully concealed the identity of
the victims for readers of the time, although some would have known who
he was talking about, but for historians now we know exactly who Law was
pointing to, the Lawrence sisters, Sarah and Maria.

Sarah and Maria Lawrence were friends of William and Jane Law when they
converted in Canada. Law led the immigration to Commerce, Illinois in
mid 1839 while the Mormons were settling the area as refugees. Sarah and
Maria were orphans who the Laws essentially adopted, but never
officially. They were basically godparents of the Lawrence sisters until
they all arrived in Commerce, soon to become Nauvoo. Eventually Emma and
Jo became the wards of the Lawrence sisters who moved into the Nauvoo
Homestead and later the Nauvoo Mansion, living together as a sealed
family. However, the Lawrence sisters also had a large inheritance they
couldn’t access until they were legal adults. Sarah and Maria were first
marked by Joseph Smith when he and Hingepin Rigdon visited the Ontario
branch of the church in August 1837. Maria was 13, Sarah 11 at that
time. They travelled to Illinois in the wake of the Missouri-Mormon War
and their father, Edward, died probably in March of 1840, leaving Maria
and Sarah, aged 17 and 14, without a legal guardian, as their mother,
Margaret, had yet to remarry and single women couldn’t have legal
custody of their children. When Emma and Jo became Maria and Sarah’s
guardians, they were put in control as trustees of the Lawrence estate.
As Todd Compton write in his book In Sacred Loneliness “This guardian
relationship is not fully understood,” which is quite an understatement
as it became a major source of dispute between Jo and the Lawrence
sisters’ mother, Margaret, after she remarried. He continues:

> After \[Josiah\] Butterfield married Margaret, he began consulting
> with Joseph Smith concerning the Lawrence inheritance. Presumably the
> estate could now be transferred to Margaret and Josiah, who would act
> as Maria’s and Sarah’s guardian. But for unknown reasons, this did not
> happen… tension began to simmer between Joseph and Josiah Butterfield
> \[concerning the estate\], until on march 28, 1843, it erupted into
> violence… “Josiah Butterfield came to my house and insulted me so
> outrageously that I kicked him out of the house, across the yard, and
> into the street.”

Yes, what an insult, to accuse the money-hungry prophet of stealing the
estate of two orphan teenagers who he’d married earlier that year at
ages 19 and 17. The dispute over this inheritance wouldn’t be resolved
before Joseph Smith died. There are other passages in Jo’s journal for
the remainder of 1843 and January 1844 of him dealing with the estate
which was apparently valued at $3,790.89 in November of 1843. On January
23, 1844, “Joseph sent for \[William Clayton\] to assist in settling
with Brother \[John\] Taylor about the Lawrence estate.” Which Todd
Compton summarizes by saying “There is some evidence that Smith intended
to transfer the guardianship to John Taylor, but there is no certain
evidence that this ever took place.”

What that means in all likelihood is that Jo stole the estate of two
orphan teenage girls, then he raped them under the guise of the New and
Everlasting Covenant of marriage. William and Jane Law cared for the
Lawrence sisters, they were family friends in Canada before immigrating
to Nauvoo and that passage we read from the Nauvoo Expositor is written
about them which perfectly describes PTSD.

When the final straw broke for Emma and she removed all her sister-wives
from the Nauvoo Mansion, arrangements were made for Maria and Sarah
Lawrence and they moved somewhere else in town. The location is unknown
but it could have been back in with their remarried mother, or possibly
somewhere else. The record isn’t clear. What precipitated their removal
from the home is quite remarkable; picking up in Todd Compton’s book on
page 476:

> the marriage to the Lawrence sisters became public knowledge when
> William law, Joseph’s second counselor in the First Presidency, became
> alienated from the prophet. Law, who had known the Lawrence family
> since their conversion in Canada, chose the marriage of Smith to Maria
> Lawrence as a test case with which to prosecute Smith for adultery. On
> May 23 he filed suit against the Mormon leader in Hancock County
> Circuit Court, at Carthage, charging that Smith had been living with
> Maria Lawrence “in an open state of adultery” from October 12, 1843,
> to the day of the suit.
> 
> In response, Smith flatly denied polygamy in a speech delivered on May
> 26: “What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing
> adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one.”

That was said during the same speech when Jo said he has more to boast
of than Jesus. Continuing:

> Smith and his counselors evidently decided to counterattack,
> prosecuting Law for slandering Maria Lawrence. On June 4 the Mormon
> leader’s journal reads, “In council with Taylor, Babbitt, Hyrum,
> Richards, Woodworth and Phelps \&c. about prosecution \[of the Laws
> and Fosters\] in behalf of Maria \[Lawrence, for slander\]. Concluded
> to go to Quincy with Taylor and give up my Bonds of guardianship \[of
> Maria Lawrence\] \&c.” The phrase “give up my Bonds of guardianship”
> suggests that Smith was transferring the guardianship to Taylor, but
> curiously, there is a certificate dated June 4, 1844, notarized by a
> Quincy justice of the peace, making Joseph guardian of the Lawrences.

These Lawrence sisters, whether they wanted it or not, became one of the
primary focuses of the Nauvoo Expositor. Notable as well in the
Expositor passage we read, Jo told them it would need to remain secret
until there was a change in government. Jo wanted his Zionic revolution
to instate a Mormon polygamous government over America once the
constitution was replaced with what his Council of Fifty had drafted.
These sisters at ages 20 and 18 became secret widows when their abuser
was assassinated in Carthage. Sarah was sealed to Bloody Brigham and
Maria to Almon Babbitt. Maria died in 1847 of unknown causes at age 23.
As Compton reports in In Sacred Loneliness, a letter to the Deseret News
from Benjamin F. Johnson describes Maria’s condition from 1844 to 47.

> Maria Lawrence died of consumption or one might more truthfully put it
> of a broken heart. My Aunt Lucy visited her and felt great sympathy
> for her. She said to Aunt one time “That if there was any truth in
> Mormonism she would be saved for said she My yoke has not been easy
> nor my burden light.” As to what was the cause of Maria’s deep sorrow
> I do not exactly know… She suffered her doubts, her fears, her
> uncertainty as to whether she was acting right or wrong, for she had a
> concience and wanted to be right, all these things told on a sensitive
> nature.

Sarah went to Utah at age 21 sealed to Bloody Brigham. She later fled to
Napa Valley, California and established a farm for herself and children.
Sarah later visited Utah in the 1860s and viciously attacked the
doctrine of polygamy and the damage it caused to practitioners. Sarah
denied any connection she had with Joseph in Nauvoo. She died of “cancer
womb” at age 46, possibly a complication of an STI she acquired in
Nauvoo or Utah as yet another unspoken reality of polygamy.

I chose to end today’s episode with this turn toward the melancholy in
Sarah and Maria Lawrences’ stories because it’s often a side of history
lost when we have the privilege of viewing these matters with hindsight.
Maria clearly suffered from some horrible mental illness as a result of
what happened to her in Nauvoo and died, probably from her depression,
although the record is unclear. Sarah suffered the consequences in a
different way and lived for decades longer to tell her tale, only to be
viciously attacked by the women in Utah when she visited, women she
considered her friends and sister-wives for years. These young girls
were marked at ages 11 and 13 by the prophet, just like Mary Elizabeth
Rollins, just like Fanny Alger, just like Helen Mar Kimball, just like
every other child victim of polygamy. Their stories are too often
forgotten or simply overshadowed by other events we view as more
consequential, but to ignore them is to ignore the darker side of
history and religious power dynamics that are a disservice to their
struggles to forget.

We’re very near the beginning of our Road to Carthage series and we’ll
be examining many different angles of Joseph Smith’s life. I’ve received
a number of messages from people who can’t wait for us to finally put
Joey in the ground. I’m with you, each and every one of you. I’ve taken
absolutely every step to vilify and destroy any whitewashed and
rose-scented legacy this man may have left behind on this podcast. I
make no effort at concealing my biases and disgust for Joseph Smith and
the church which followed in his wake and I want us all to understand
those biases and the privilege we have to view him these ways.

Whether it’s Eliza R. Snow, the Apostles or Council of Fifty, Brigham
Young, Lucy Mack, Joseph H. Jackson, Sarah and Maria Lawrence, Emma,
William and Jane Law, Governor Ford or Thomas Sharp of the Warsaw
Signal, Helen Mar Kimball and her parents Heber and Vilote, Sidney and
Phebe Rigdon and their daughter Nancy, John C. Bennett, Emily and Eliza
Partridge, Elizabeth Davis Durfee, Patty Sessions, Alvah and Louisa
Beaman, David and John Whitmer, Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, Sophronia
Smith, it doesn’t matter who it is, each and every one of these people
were affected in some way by what transpired the evening of June
27<sup>th</sup>, 1844. Each of their lives were moved and shaped by one
human being in one way or another. Each and every one of these people
were overcome with complicated emotions when they first heard of the
death of Joseph Smith. I’d like to think they remembered the moment they
heard like we remember when we first learned about JFK getting shot or
the Twin Towers, or some other monumental thing happening. Each and
every one of these people likely remembered the exact moment when they
heard the prophet had been slain. Each and every one of them had their
lives forever changed that day. Each and every one of them were overcome
by emotions we could never understand; we can only see a window into
their minds by what they left behind.
