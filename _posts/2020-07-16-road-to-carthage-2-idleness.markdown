Why is it that somebody chooses to start a religion? Our world is often
measured by the religion of any collective population. Somebody who
comes from America is probably a Christian, from Saudi Arabia a Muslim,
from India a Hindu, from Utah a Mormon. Nearly infinite historical
factors play into why this is the case but the root of those factors so
often is one guy, yes guy, who says I’m going to start a religion. Most
world religions are so disconnected from their founders by time and lack
of documentation so Mormonism presents a fascinating case study in this
regard. Not only is the founder of Mormonism well-studied, but we have
thousands of documents which shed light on his decision-making
processes. We have newspapers and books from the time and place where
this religious leader grew up and we can watch how societal elements
factored into Jo’s burgeoning religion. We have affidavits and
interviews with his neighbors, both friends and enemies, we have
membership records of certain people joining the church at certain times
who influenced the direction of Jo’s religion in one way or another. We
have birth, marriage, and death dates of thousands of Jo’s early
followers. We have a reminiscence from Jo’s own mother written soon
after his death providing a unique and unvarnished account of the Smith
family dynamics. We have thousands of letters written by the hands of
these early saints, along with hundreds of journals, giving historians a
window into the past unmatched by basically any other world religion. A
lot of people wonder if Christianity would be a thing today if we had
modern court documents and newspaper clippings about the cult of Jesus
detailing just how weird and abusive it was, not to mention just how
much Jesus would be castigated by most modern Christians for being pinko
hippie commie scum; I think the existence of Mormonism is a perfect
example to say Christianity definitely would exist because cults crop up
every day and the leaders who start them are a dime a dozen.

Some are more successful than others. Some cult leaders never count more
than a handful of devoted followers their entire life and ministry;
others are elected president. There are nearly infinite variables which
contribute to starting, growing, and maintaining a cult. The variables
are extensive and often invisible, but the algorithms are largely the
same. A smart young boy, and yes I say boy because that’s a core shared
trait of this phenomenon. Female and non-binary cult leaders aren’t
unheard of, but so far outshadowed by male cult leaders. In Jo’s time
Ellen G. White, Joanna Southcott, the Universal Friend, they’re outliers
which only highlight the trend in this male-dominated phenomenon. So, a
smart young boy grows up in a house, usually with lots of siblings
making the competition for mom’s and dad’s attention fierce. They never
get enough resources to thrive and flourish from the family, forcing
them to seek fulfillment from the outside world. Some combination of
their biology and sociology makes these people particularly observant of
the world around them and eventually they learn their most valuable
skill set which serves them for the rest of their lives; manipulation.

The lessons are hard, but plentiful, and manipulation tactics become a
primary tool used by these people, manipulation is a hammer and every
problem can be a nail. They learn that if they say something one way, it
will cause people to hate or fear them, but if they simply say it a
different way then it will cause people to do whatever the person says.
Once this tool is utilized and the wielder of said tool becomes a master
at using it, the world becomes a sandbox in which these people can build
whatever their hearts desire.

Manipulation is, at its core, one of the greatest demonstrations of
human laziness. Using language, in the case of cult leaders often
language which claims to come from god, to coerce people into doing
things they otherwise wouldn’t is lazy. Now, don’t get me wrong,
coercing people to do things that are good for others is what society,
government, and social contracts in general are about; not all coercion
or manipulation is bad. What I’m saying is one person manipulating
others for their own self-serving interests is absolutely integral to
starting a cult and it is indolence in its most basic form. A basic
motivation of every cult leader is laziness. Populism requires an
exalted weathervane who moves and turns with the tides and forces of
society.

There’s a larger point nested in this conversation worth examining here.
Society deems knowledge valuable. In today’s society, big data drives
everything and it’s a multi-billion dollar per year industry. The Mormon
church today is a big data company, funding millions of labor-hours into
collecting genealogy, history, and population data. Knowledge is how
society moves, whether progressive or regressive is often a subject of
heated debate. We pay people to think, especially when they tell us
stuff we like to hear. But, there’s a subtle and important distinction
between a principled philosopher, a scientist, and a cult leader. One we
support as a society because their knowledge is valuable, the other we
support as a society because we’re manipulated into doing so; they’re a
vestigial trait of humanity.

One is a person saying, this is what I think about the world and let’s
have a dialogue. The other is a person saying this is how the world
works because my god told me so; if you dare correct me then you’re my
enemy.

You see the difference? Philosophy is a noble endeavor requiring a
lifetime of devotion and study. A cult leader is the very antithesis of
philosophy. They exist to tell us Truth with a capital “T”. A
philosopher exists to ask questions and probe the phenomenon of human
consciousness. Philosophy is an inherently tenacious practice and often
leads to more questions than answers. Cult leaders exist by virtue of
shutting down questions with profundities as non-answers; questioning
which often leads to adverse consequences for the questioner; a delicate
beliefs system balancing on the pillars of manipulation, groupthink, and
untestable claims. Cults are inherently lazy. Cult leaders are the
pinnacle of human mental lethargy; so what does that say about their
followers? Why think about my existence and ethics when somebody will
simply tell me all the answers? A lazy existence built on a system of
lazy morals.

Remarkably, cults can define generations of populations. People can be
industrious and hard-working within a system of lazy morals because
their work contributes to building the kingdom of lies. Those same
people, however, are lazy. They refuse to let their morals, ethics, or
beliefs be questioned because they know for a fact that they already
have all the right answers. Probing into their own sense of morals too
often conflicts with those given them by their manipulative leaders so
it’s far easier to just put those questions on the shelf and ignore
them. I’ll get the answers to those tough questions after I die.

I myself have spent enough time with both cult followers and leaders to
know this intellectual indolence first hand. It is a scourge,
intellectual cancer, harnessed to shut down human inquisitiveness,
ceding ground to that thought-damning phrase “because that’s the way it
is”. These people are as friendly as can be until you introduce a
question which shakes their convictions and reveals how inert their
beliefs truly are; then their entire countenance shifts, they become
defensive because that question wasn’t just targeting what they believe,
but a core piece of their identity. Cult leaders thrive on identity.
They weaponize identity, regressing their followers into tribalistic
behavior and a false victimhood mentality, fabricating a persecution
complex often out of thin air. They do this because the system of
beliefs simply can’t stand up to inquiry or skepticism; evolving the
beliefs would require effort and harmonizing but the cult leaders and
followers have worked tirelessly to secure the belief system as
lethargic and monolithic. It’s a bit of a paradox. Empires built on lies
require work to grow and maintain while simultaneously capturing the
worst of human tendencies of torpidity. I’m so certain I’m right that I
will spend every waking moment working to build the kingdom of god.
Anybody who questions this is an enemy attacking my identity and
deserving of ignoring at best and violence at worst.

This intellectual laziness is, unfortunately, infectious and hereditary.
A person who devotes their life to building up the cult may work 18 hour
days 365 days of the year, they wouldn’t typically be classified as
lazy, certainly not by their fellow cult members. But that devotion is
deeply rooted in laziness; an unwillingness to confront unknown unknowns
and form a personal moral compass. A philosopher may spend weeks at a
time in their home reading and writing, never lifting a finger for any
manual labor as their energy is far more valuable when expended on
thought than physical action; the philosopher may be seen as lazy for
spending so little time in “work” as we often call physically-demanding
activities not for pleasure. But in reality, the scientist or
philosopher is expending vast mental resources to attack different
angles of what it is to be human or what we observe in our universe.
These are not lazy people and far more often they leave behind a legacy
worth veneration, admiration, and further study. The difference is in
how these people view the world and what forms the basis of their
morality. A philosopher will deal with the trolly problem in complex
ways while the cult leader or follower will simply declare god’s will in
the matter, an inherently untestable assertion.

This paradoxical nature of philosophical verses declaratory morality
places the focus of our study at the crux of this paradox. If we view
the life and legacy of Joseph Smith, laziness isn’t typically an
attribute we would use. He built cities, wrote books, was editor of
multiple newspapers, formed his own armies, ran hundreds of businesses
throughout his life, seldom had any time to help raise his children
because each day was occupied with building his own empire. These are
not activities people would often ascribe to laziness but I do when I
consider the underpinnings of these actions, the root cause, if you
will. As much as Jo’s legacy is marked by these accomplishments, far
more of his day-to-day actions were governed by delegating tasks to
people who believed his outlandish and untestable claims. When the
impetus behind what he delegated was ever questioned, the answer was
always the same; because I said so in the name of the lord. Thus saith
the lord, give me your farm. Thus saith the lord, build me a city. Thus
saith the lord, kill that person because they’re a mobocrat. Thus saith
the lord, and fill in the blank. This is intellectual lethargy. Why is
something the way it is? Because god said so; I know because I talk to
him all the time. I don’t believe that you talk to god. Burn the
heretic\! Why do we burn the heretic? Because god said so.
Self-selection in the body of followers and their often violent
opposition to anybody who questions, the very threat of intellectual
work, drags entire populations toward collective stupidity. This
laziness is infectious and hereditary; given long enough to mature and
grow, entire populations of people are known by their intellectual
laziness. That means the work of destroying sacred cows is a long and
labor-intensive process; but, more dangerously, it’s often seen as
attacking entire populations of people when the attacks aren’t aimed at
the individuals so much as the ideology with which they identify.
Attacking beliefs versus attacking believers is a subtle but important
line cults thrive on blurring. Identity of members becomes so tightly
intertwined with their beliefs that they’re unable to see the difference
when presented with information that forces them out of their
intellectual laziness. It’s not anti-Mormons, it’s anti-Mormonism that’s
an arduous work worthy of investment and determination.

Before there was a gold bible written by ancient Native American Jews in
Reformed Egyptian, before angels administered to Joseph Smith in his
room late at night, before he had a scribe to write his claimed words of
god, Jo dug for buried treasure. For a young man with a healing leg and
an intemperate father as a role model, any way to get money for himself
and the Smith family was explored, especially when it didn’t involve
physical labor. Understandably, when the cake and beer shop, odd jobs
for local farmers, and other menial jobs presented too much work,
digging for buried treasure provided an easier way to make money.

Historian Ronald Walker, who by the way was a faithful Mormon, wrote a
really good article about Joe’s magical treasure hunting, putting it in
the context of a larger treasure hunting culture. It’s called “The
Persisting Idea of American Treasure Hunting.” Walker says,

> From colonial times to at least the Age of Jackson, Americans dug for
> magical treasure. There were hundreds and probably thousands of these
> ‘money diggers,’ all seeking troves of fabled coins, mines, jewels,
> and other valued prizes. . . . Yet, for all this prodigious toil,
> their ‘finds’ were as rare as Merlin’s transmuted gold. . . . Relying
> on an immemorial but now forgotten world view, the money diggers
> placed faith in conjuring, elemental spirits, thrice-spoken dreams,
> seeric gifts, and enchanted treasure that could slip and rumble
> through the earth as easily as a fish moving through the deep. . . .
> But getting the treasure was always difficult and harrowing. If not
> recovered quickly, the trove sank into the earth’s depths until its
> next far-in-the-future ‘blooming.’ Further, the digger might have to
> outwit the man-like elemental spirits \[who guarded the treasure\].

The guardians were often devils,

> who moved treasures about maliciously to prevent their discovery and
> created distracting spectres to impede digging. . . . If such things
> did not scare the seeker from his booty, they invariably caused him to
> break the taboo of silence, which ended any chance of success. Faced
> with these odds, the European treasure seeker tried to narrow the
> odds. To facilitate his search, he listened carefully to the treasure
> dreams of a pure or innocent youth, who it was believed had special
> powers to discern and recover the subterranean bounty. ‘Earth
> mirrors,’ seer stones, or divining rods crafted from hazel or
> mistletoe were also thought to be useful searching tools.

To prevent the treasure from slipping away through the earth,

> Clever diggers might construct a trench outside and below the chest
> and approach it from underneath. Such a plan, however, ran the risk of

> also used. The common European pattern placed the adept at the center
> of the treasure circle, sword or wand in hand, where he observed
> planetary positions and propitiated the treasure demons with Old
> Testament sacrifices \[especially of dogs or sheep\].

Walker gives a bunch of examples of just how old these treasure stories
are. We find them in ancient Egypt, in Greek epic poetry, and in the
Dead Sea Scrolls of ancient Judea. According to Walker, “the ideas of
hidden but guarded treasure, with their secondary motifs of ancient
texts, animals, bozes, devils, caves, gold, incantations, mountains, and
even the ratifying number three” were “a part of the central beliefs of
Indo-European folk culture.” They thrived in Europe for millennia.
“Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Walter Scott, Edvard Grieg, Henrik
Ibsen, and especially the Germans Goethe and E. T. A. Hoffmann used
treasure images in their works.” Understandably, these beliefs crossed
the Atlantic to America, where they influenced Joe Smith. Episodes 1,
152 and 155.

These stories may have been old, but they were also always looked down
upon by “polite society”. There is no evidence that they actually found
any treasure, making it pretty obvious, at least to educated people,
that this whole thing was at worst a con, and at best a totally
unproductive hobby. Notably as well, although there isn’t any solid
evidence of this occurring with the Smith treasure diggers, buried
treasure was a great way to launder counterfeit money. An habitually
destitute person walks into the local shop with a bag of gold coins,
people are going to be skeptical as to where it came from. Found it
while digging in the woods is a satisfying explanation for a while and
it may even motivate more folks to join the group and fund treasure digs
of their own. When those digs came up dry, the conjuration was performed
incorrectly and the dupe walks away with their pockets lighter and the
Smiths have a few meals paid for.

Hard-working people who take the slow, hard way to wealth have always
looked at people who chase get-rich-quick schemes as lazy. This is the
paradox discussed earlier. It can be hard work to be a sucker who
believes in ghost stories and magic. Have you ever spent an entire night
digging trenches nine feet deep in order to try to approach a slippery
treasure chest from underneath after acquiring the ingredients and
chanting the appropriate words for the spell to bind the chest to its
location? While the act requires a lot of work, the pursuit itself is an
effort to get rich quick and regarded as idleness by folks who actually
work or study for their paycheck.

It’s within this context we should consider what Jo’s neighbors said
about him; some of it is coming from a place of prejudice against
treasure-digging and magical pursuits. But there’s another layer as well
because it’s hard to tell whether Joe did much actual digging, the
working part of the lazy endeavor. Lorenzo Saunders says in a November
1884 affidavit that when the Smiths dug for treasure, Jo himself didn’t
actually dig. He was the orchestrator, the specialist performing
sacrifices or doing magic to ward away evil spirits, and he left the
hard work to the grunts. As the treasure-digging company’s seer, Jo
would have spent more of his time locating the buried treasure than
actually digging for it, often doing so from a remote location.

With that said, let’s dig into the accounts (you see what I did there…
dig into the accounts… (One of these jokes has to land eventually) from
some of Joe’s neighbors that described him as lazy. In spite of what
apologists may claim, the accounts are plentiful and far from one-offs
of neighbors mentioning it in passing. They come from all over the
19th-century, many contemporary, some later reminiscences, and some are
even sworn and notarized affidavits, which historians absolutely love to
have.

Let’s start with a New York neighbor of the Smiths, Parley Chase, who
said in a sworn affidavit dated December 13, 1833 “that not one of the
male members of the Smith family were entitled to any credit,
whatsoever. They were lazy, intemperate and worthless men, very much
addicted to lying. In this they frequently boasted of their skill.
Digging for money was their principal employment.” A March 20, 1834
affidavit signed by 11 New York neighbors similarly said that the Smiths
“were not only a lazy, indolent set of men, but also intemperate; and
their word was not to be depended upon; and that we are truly glad to
dispense with their society.” Henry Harris’s affidavit, signed December
9, 1833, said the Smiths “were regarded by the community in which they
lived, as a lying and indolent set of men and no confidence could be
placed in them.” Indolent, by the way, is a great indie-prog album by
the band slothful. Likewise, William Riley Hine said in an affidavit in
the 1880s that he “heard a man say who was a neighbor to the Mormon
Smith family, in Palmyra, N.Y., that they were thieves, indolent, the
lowest and meanest family he ever saw or heard of.”

A mail carrier who regularly passed through Palmyra on his way back and
forth from Canada to Kansas said in article published in the June 7,
1855 *Texas Ranger*, “\[I\] well remember of hearing frequently of the
pranks of ‘Lazy Joe.’” Even Lorenzo Saunders, who liked Joe and defended
him and said the Smiths were great sugar makers, also said in a November
12, 1884 interview that “Joseph Smith never did work. They claim there
in that book that Jo. Smith was a great worker. he was a lazy dog, I
tell you the truth.”

Not exactly a resounding endorsement for the Smith family’s work ethic.
Most of those statements are pretty vague and general, they could mean a
lot of different forms of laziness. There are, however, plenty of
statements available which detail this indolence to a greater extent.
Joshua Stafford was another neighbor of the Smiths in New York. He said
in an affidavit signed November 15, 1833 that when the Smiths first
arrived in the Palmyra, New York area, they were poor, but “were
laboring people.” But, he adds:

> A short time after this, they commenced digging for hidden treasures,
> and soon after they became indolent \[or lazy\], and told marvellous
> stories about ghosts, hob-goblins, caverns, and various other
> mysterious matters. Joseph once showed me a piece of wood which he
> said he took from a box of money, and the reason he gave for not
> obtaining the box, was, that it moved. At another time, he, (Joseph,
> Jr.) at a husking, called on me to become security for a horse, and
> said he would reward me handsomely, for he had found a box of watches,
> and they were as large as his fist, and he put one of them to his ear,
> and he could hear it "tick forty rods." Since he could not dispose of
> them profitably at Canandaigua or Palmyra, he wished to go east with
> them. He said if he did not return with the horse, I might take his
> life. I replied, that he knew I would not do that. Well, said he, I
> did not suppose you would, yet I would be willing that you should. He
> was nearly intoxicated at the time of the above conversation.

Stafford’s view of Joe as lazy apparently stemmed partly from the fact
that Joe manipulated people into giving him things rather than earning
them, and partly from the fact that Joe was a drunkard, which we’ll
discuss in a coming episode of this series. That’s a pretty good
manipulation tactic, right? You sound really sincere if you swear on
your life and give someone permission to kill you if you don’t come
through. Jo knew this was an impotent promise with no real consequences
because Stafford wasn’t a murderer. We can see from these statements
that Jo was developing a toolbox of manipulation tactics he’d utilize
and expand throughout the remainder of his life, especially when it came
to his ministry. His concealment of the claimed gold plates rings true
to this, when he claimed to multiple people, including Martin Harris,
that if they saw the plates uncovered the penalty would be death on the
spot. Let’s face it, the greatest fear an imposter carries is being
discovered. For that reason Jo had to invent greater and greater lies
which would insulate those lower-level lies from being discovered. A
habitual liar is the laziest person in the room.

These manipulations would manifest by similar tactics when it came to Jo
developing higher ranks of church leadership where participants would
gain access to greater mysteries if they would only give their property
or wives to the prophet. If you can’t acquire these goods by your own
merits or labor, just convince those who have them to give them up by
manipulation and threats with life and death, or even eternal,
consequences. If the person offering you salvation is also the person
threatening you with punishment, it isn’t salvation it’s self-serving
extortion. See Council of Fifty episodes 168-170, polygamy eps 161,
148-49, 116, Masonry and endowment 110-11, 108, 100, 57, Mormon
theocracy ep 85-6, 72, 66, Evolving hierarchy ep 25, 23, 22.

Another Stafford neighbor of the Smiths, David Stafford, expressed
similar concerns in an affidavit dated December 5, 1833:

> I have been acquainted with the family of Joseph Smith Sen. for
> several years, and I know him to be a drunkard and a liar, and to be
> much in the habit of gambling. He and his boys were truly a lazy set
> of fellows, and more particularly Joseph, who, very aptly followed his
> father's example, and in some respects was worse. . . It is well
> known, that the general employment of the Smith family was money
> digging and fortune-telling. They kept around them constantly, a gang
> of worthless fellows who dug for money nights, and were idle in the
> day time. It was a mystery to their neighbors how they got their
> living. I will mention some circumstances and the public may judge for
> themselves. At different times I have seen them come from the woods
> early in the morning, bringing meat which looked like mutton. I went
> into the woods one morning very early, shooting patridges and found
> Joseph Smith Sen. in company with two other men, with hoes, shovels
> and meat that looked like mutton. On seeing me they run like wild men
> to get out of sight. -- Seeing the old man a few day afterwards, I
> asked him why he run so the other day in the woods, ah, said he, you
> know that circumstances alter cases; it will not do to be seen at all
> time\[s\].

The Smiths were drunkards, gamblers, and secretive with their magical
practices, funding their lifestyles by unknown means. Gambling and
speculation also fits with the general theme of get-rich-quick schemes
and these tendencies would manifest in Jo’s ministry through constant
land speculation in Kirtland, Missouri, and Nauvoo. The Smiths dug for
buried treasure at night but were idle during the day, which may help
account for why people viewed them as lazy. If you only work while other
people are sleeping, they’ll never see you working, but that’s only if
we qualify chasing buried treasure guarded by magical spirits as work.
The get-rich-quick idea underpinning the buried treasure hunts was, at
the end of the day, a lazy endeavor, but that’s indolence built on
indolence as the very act of never questioning the mindset which
produces the beliefs in magic and the occult also reveals a level of
intellectual laziness discussed at the beginning of the episode.

Suffice it to say, the Smiths also didn’t seem to have any honest way of
making money, and Stafford had reasons to suspect that Joseph Smith Sr.
might have a bunch of stolen mutton stashed in the woods. From where the
mutton came, we can only speculate but the multiple accounts of the
Smiths sacrificing lambs to the treasure guardian spirits will suffice.

An anonymous letter in the October 26, 1883 Cincinnati Enquirer by
someone who had interviewed some Harmony Pennsylvania residents says,
“From all accounts he \[Joseph Jr.\] was a lazy, idle, shrewd,
plausible, schemer and pretender.” The letter goes on to tell the story
of Jo’s involvement in a treasure dig for William Hale and Oliver Harper
in Harmony, Pennsylvania, where he met his to-be wife, Emma Hale.
Apparently Joe, in his early twenties by now, pointed out a spot where
the treasure was buried.

> After digging the depth indicated by Smith no trace of the treasure
> was discovered, whereupon Mr. Harper became discouraged. Smith, who
> was as tricky as a snake, then pretended that there was an enchantment
> about the place that was removing the treasure further and further
> away, and said that Harper must get a perfectly white dog and sprinkle
> its blood over the ground, and that would dispel the obnoxious charm.
> Work was suspended and a search for a perfectly white dog was begun.
> None perfectly white could be found in the neighborhood. Smith said
> perhaps a perfectly white sheep would answer. One was procured,
> killed, and its blood sprinkled over the ground and the work of
> excavation was resumed. No trace of the treasure was found, though six
> holes, one of them fifty feet in diameter and twenty feet deep, were
> dug. After expending over $2,000 in this fruitless labor, Mr. Harper
> refused to put in any more money and the digging ceased. Smith said
> that God Almighty was angry at them for attempting to palm off a white
> sheep on Him for that of a white dog, and so had allowed the
> enchantment to remove the treasure which was there when they began
> operations.

The content of this letter, although late and anonymous, reveals many
aspects of how treasure digging was developed and conducted as a con
from the very beginning. If this were the only account historians have,
it would be anti-Mormon and rightfully regarded as ridiculous but given
the plethora of similar accounts ranging from contemporary to decades
after, along with the remarkable consistency in the methods and
practices used in the treasure digs, the accusations that these are
anti-Mormon lies falls under the crushing weight of all these statements
taken together. It also reveals the pattern of a habitual liar when
faced with no resolution other than admitting it was all made up, turn
to deflection and finally say daddy was too mad for us to be successful.
There was no bottom to these lies. There was always a position for
retreat when the treasure digs were unsuccessful, which was a pattern
revealed in Jo’s ministry as well. If something went wrong or somebody
called Jo out in a lie, an excuse, some form of retreat always existed.
Any master manipulator always knows the locations of all exits in the
room.

This treasure dig in Harmony, Pennsylvania is important, because while
Joe was working for William Hale and Oliver Harper, he stayed at the
home of Isaac Hale and got to know Isaac’s daughter, Emma Hale. Emma and
Joe eventually eloped, against her parents’ wishes, and in August 1827,
Joe’s Palmyra neighbor Peter Ingersoll accompanied Joe to the Hale home
in Harmony, Pennsylvania to pick up Emma’s belongings and furniture to
transport them back to Palmyra. When they arrived, according to
Ingersoll’s affidavit,

> His father-in-law (Mr. Hale) addressed Joseph, in a flood of tears:
> "You have stolen my daughter and married her. I had much rather have
> followed her to her grave. You spend your time in digging for money --
> pretend to see in a stone, and thus try to deceive people." Joseph
> wept, and acknowledged he could not see in a stone now, nor never
> could; and that his former pretensions in that respect, were all
> false. He then promised to give up his old habits of digging for money
> and looking into stones. Mr. Hale told Joseph, if he would move to
> Pennsylvania and work for a living, he would assist him in getting
> into business. Joseph acceded to this proposition.

Isaac Hale and Emma’s brother Alva also reported this incident.
According to Isaac’s affidavit dated March 20, 1834, “Smith stated to
me, that he had given up what he called ‘glass-looking,’ and that he
expected to work hard for a living, and was willing to do so.” And
according to Alva, Jo admitted that “peeping \[in seer stones for
treasure\] was all d---d nonsense. He (Smith) was deceived himself but
did not intend to deceive others; --that he intended to quit the
business, (of peeping) and labor for his livelihood.” When Jo and Emma
were first married, he had a chance to alter his ways. He could have
abandoned his indolent past, he could have reformed and made the right
decision. Instead, however, laziness transcends the wishes of a
disapproving father-in-law and public condemnation. If only Jo had kept
this promise, American history might look very different. I also want to
tease apart what Alvah claimed Jo said, that he was deceived but didn’t
intend to deceive others. For a brief moment, the curtain is torn from
the charlatan and the wizard pulling the levers is revealed. Evidence
like this leads Dan Vogel, among other historians, to stick with the
‘pious fraud’ theory of Joseph Smith, that he was a fraud to begin
with and used piety and religion as his cover to sell the fraud. I tend
to agree. Being cognizant of one’s own deception rules out many
cognitive functions which would tend to posit Jo was personally deceived
or sincerely believed in what he said throughout his life. He absolutely
knew it was all a fraud all along. Preserving that fraud found him in
more intense and dire situations as his ministry evolved and all of that
was predicated on his inherent dishonesty and laziness to deal with his
affinity for dishonesty.

Jo’s involvement in magical money-digging got him in trouble with the
law in 1826, the same year the American Temperance Society was formed in
Boston, when he was working as a treasure seer for Josiah Stowell in
South Bainbridge, New York. Josiah Stowell was a full believer in Joe’s
magical powers, but Josiah’s nephew Peter G. Bridgeman could see Joseph
Smith for the listless and lazy liar he was at heart. Bridgeman brought
charges against Joseph Smith under a New York statute from 1811. Here’s
the relevant portion of the statute under which Jo was charged:

> all persons who not having wherewith to maintain themselves, live idle
> without employment, and also all persons who go about from door to
> door, or place themselves in the streets, highways or passages, to beg
> in the cities or towns where they respectively dwell, and all
> jugglers, and all persons pretending to have skill in physiognomy,
> palmistry, or like crafty science, or pretending to tell fortunes, or
> to discover where lost goods may be found; … shall be deemed and
> adjudged disorderly persons.

By virtue of this 1811 law existing, people like Joseph Smith were
common and seen as a blight on enlightened society. At its core, this
was a vagrancy law that was loaded with other definitions to dragnet a
lot of unpleasant people together under the same criminal statute. The
term “crafty science” refers explicitly to the practices of magic and
occult employed by the Smiths for locating and extracting the
non-existent treasure Jo would see underground with his peeping stone.
It was an art practiced by the lowest in society, aimed at the credulous
middle-class to extract their money through minimal effort. It’s no
different from fortune tellers and astrologers in LA making celebrities
their chief clientele today, but at the time there were laws against it
which were enforced. But if we just let the market regulate itself all
this pseudo science will die off\! Unfortunately people are too stupid
to self-regulate without draining their pockets with buffalo excrement
at best or killing themselves at worst. Jo was charged with a
misdemeanor as a “disorderly person” because he lived idle with no
employment except for pretending to discover where lost goods were found
and taking money for his services which were clearly utilized as a con.
This was crafty science and I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why
that phrase is no longer in our modern lexicon or stare decisis.

Bossman Josiah Stowell testified at the trial in Joe’s defense. Stowell
confirmed that he had hired Joe to search for several treasures, but he
denied that Joe was only pretending. Stowell said “that he positively
knew that the prisoner could tell, and did possess the art of seeing
those valuable treasures through the medium of said stone.”

Stowell went on to give a couple examples of how he knew Joe really had
magical powers. On one occasion, the “prisoner had looked through said
stone for Deacon Attleton for a mine, did not exactly find it, but got a
p\[iece\] of ore which resembled gold, he thinks.” Joe promised gold,
and although they didn’t find any gold, they did find iron pyrite, also
known as fool’s gold. Easy mistake to make, but it proved that Jo really
could see things in his stone to the credulous Josiah Stowell.

On another occasion, the “prisoner had told by means of this stone where
a Mr. Bacon had buried money; that he and prisoner had been in search of
it; that prisoner had said it was in a certain root of a stump five feet
from surface of the earth, and with it would be found a tail feather;
that said Stowel and prisoner thereupon commenced digging, found a tail
feather, but money was gone; that he supposed the money moved down.” Joe
planted a feather, and that was enough to prove to Bossman Josiah
Stowell beyond a shadow of a doubt that Joe had magic powers. These
schemes were clearly premeditated to acquire money through the smallest
amount of work possible. That leaves a question standing as the elephant
in the room; these treasure digging practices all occurred during the
period Jo claimed he was communing with angels after his theophany, soon
before he would author the Book of Mormon. When exactly during the 1820s
did Jo change his ways? When did his treasure digging change from a way
to make an easy dollar to being divinely sanctioned scripture writing
and religion building? When did Jo stop being a loafing deceiver and
become a prophet of god? Maybe… and I know this is pretty far out there,
but maybe it never stopped.

The witnesses for the prosecution, Arad Stowell, a Mr. McMaster, and
Jonathan Thompson, gave a few more examples. Arad Stowell and McMaster
testified that to try to prove his abilities to them, Joe had “laid a
book upon a white cloth, and proposed looking through another stone
which was white and transparent, hold the stone to the candle, turn his
head to book, and read. The deception appeared so palpable that witness
went off disgusted.” It’s a little unclear here whether Joe had
memorized passages from the book in advance, or whether he was tilting
his head to peek at the pages while he read, but anyway, these two guys
weren’t fooled. Jo’s ability to locate and read a mark, a prospective
person to be conned, became one of his greatest skills which would serve
him the rest of his life. It’s likely his deceptions aimed at Josiah
Stowell were no more believable than that book-reading example, but
Bossman Jo’s credulity made him an easy mark for Jo. The first skill a
successful con man learns is identifying easy marks. How far he goes
with that mark or how much a conman takes that mark for a ride is far
more up to the mark than the conman himself.

Jonathan Thompson tells about a different incident, when the

> prisoner was requested to look for chest of money; did look, and
> pretended to know there it was; and that prisoner, Thompson, and
> Yeomans went in search of it; that Smith arrived at spot first; was at
> night; that Smith looked in hat while there, and when very dark, told
> how the chest was situated. After digging several feet, struck upon
> something sounding like a board or plank. Prisoner would not look
> again, pretending that he was alarmed on account of the circumstances
> relating to the trunk being buried, \[which\] came all fresh to his
> mind. That the last time he looked he discovered distinctly the two
> Indians who buried the trunk, that a quarrel ensued between them, and
> that one of said Indians was killed by the other, and thrown into the
> hole beside the trunk, to guard it, as he supposed.

When it comes to these magic practices used as cons, there always needs
to be an out. Something in the spell was said wrong, the participants
were in the wrong mindset, the wrong planets are governing the season,
the dog was spotted instead of pure white, one of the diggers has
indigestion, whatever the excuse the person orchestrating the con has to
be able to blame something when it doesn’t work as proposed. For Jo and
the treasure diggers, the chest kept sinking. Thompson continues:

> Thompson says that he believes in the prisoner's professed skill; that
> the board which he struck his spade upon was probably the chest, but
> on account of an enchantment the trunk kept settling away from under
> them when digging, that notwithstanding they continued constantly
> removing the dirt, yet the trunk kept about the same distance from
> them.

The pursuit of worldly treasures by utilizing the power of magic like
this never really pans out. The pursuit of worldly treasures by
utilizing the power of god is the next logical step because it rarely
fails. Oddly enough, Thompson was called a witness for the prosecution,
but he actually ended up saying he believed Joe could see things in his
stone, so I guess his testimony sort of also supported the defense?
There is some consistency to the various witness statements, that they
believed Jo could actually see what he claimed, but that they were
merely unsuccessful in the digs. These testimonies foreshadowed what
would be a common theme in Jo’s ministry; people believed what he said
even when evidence right in front of their faces would indicate the
contrary. Jo refused to make his money from honest hard work so his
charisma was his tool of choice to get people to give him *their* money.

The infamous 1826 trial record ends by saying, “And therefore the Court
find the Defendant guilty.” In some ways this looks like *legal proof*
that Jo was a disorderly idle person with no employment except for
pretending to look for lost objects and buried treasure. The truth is a
little more complicated and allows apologists to carve out
interpretations of the evidence which don’t cast Joseph Smith into such
a negative light. This was just a pre-trial hearing, so the guilty
verdict was only an indictment, not a conviction. William D. Purple,
Abraham W. Benton, and Joel K. Noble all said that Jo was either
released or allowed to escape on “leg bail” without a trial, either
because he was a minor or because the court didn’t want to impugn Josiah
Stowell’s reputation with an embarrassing trial. People will say he was
never convicted in that trial as exonerating evidence that Jo was
actually an honest young man, but that summary of the evidence is easily
belied by reading the witness’s statements which describe his conduct as
run-of-the-mill con artistry and “crafty sciences”.

Four years later, in 1830, Joe was re-arrested to finally be put to
trial on this charge of disorderly person, but this time he was
acquitted because of the statute of limitations-- too long a time had
passed since the crime. The 1830 trial produced some more amusing
testimony, however.

At this trial, Josiah Stowell testified about a horse that Jo had
borrowed and never returned. Stowell remained certain that Jo would
eventually pay the debt. “I hold his note for the price of the horse,
which I consider as good as the pay-- for I am well acquainted with
Joseph Smith Jr., and know him to be an honest man; and if he wishes I
am ready to let him have another horse on the same terms.” Jo combined
tactics of mind control had a complete hold on Bossman Josiah Stowell.
He was clearly working on honing his skills of cult mind control before
the Gold Bible story was widely circulated as evidenced by the 1826
trial. The development of his skills is revealed in the differences
between what Stowell said in the 1826 trial verses the 1830 trial.
Stowell and other wealthy men became the marks of Joseph Smith and he
bled them dry while utilizing cult mind control tactics to the point
they implicitly trusted him with anything and everything he needed, all
while the majority of other people connected with the Smith family
regarded them as lazy and intemperate hucksters.

Whether Josiah Stowell, Martin Harris (NSSM), Newel K. Whitney, John
Johnson, or any other well-off mark targeted by Jo, the sunk-cost
fallacy will cause otherwise reasonable people to do the dumbest things
and sacrifice their livelihood. Abram W. Benton also recorded this
fantastic exchange between Stowell and the prosecution’s lawyer:

> Q: “Did Smith ever tell you there was money hid in a certain place
> which he mentioned?”
> 
> A: “Yes.” …
> 
> Q: “Did you dig?”
> 
> A: “Yes.”
> 
> Q: “Did you find any money?”
> 
> A: “No.”
> 
> Q: “Did he not lie to you then, and deceive you?”
> 
> A: “No\! The money was there, but we did not get quite to it\!”
> 
> Q: “How do you know it was there?”
> 
> A: “Smith said it was\!”

What could I possibly say about this interaction that it doesn’t say for
itself? That exchange needs no commentary. Jo was many things, but a
master-manipulator of credulous minds may truly be his crowning
character trait. But for our purposes, the money quote from the 1830
trial comes from the testimony of Addison Austin. According to Austin,
during the time period when Joe was leading treasure hunts for Stowell,
Austin got Joe alone “and asked him to tell honestly whether he could
see this money or not.” Austin said that “Smith hesitated for some time,
but finally replied, ‘to be candid, between you and me, I cannot, any
more than you or any body else; but any way to get a living.’” Any way
to get a living which doesn’t involve swinging an axe, tilling a field,
keeping a ledger book, hammering metal, milking a cow, studying books,
or building a cabinet anyway. Jo’s lethargy for real work is a notable
pattern emerging from the earliest accounts about his life including
these court records. One other detail worth noting in this hearing,
Bossman Josiah Stowell’s daughters were called to testify against Joseph
Smith about him being… let’s just say “improper” towards them. But,
that’s a story for a different time. Eps 11, 12, and 21.

All of this was happening during the gestation period of the Book of
Mormon, Jo’s greatest undertaking ruled by indolence. After Joseph Smith
claimed he’d gotten the golden plates from Moroni in 1827, he started
writing the Book of Mormon with Martin Harris in the spring. By the way,
Marty was a farmer, and spring is a really important season for farmers.
If you don’t get your crops in the ground in the spring, the entire
season is lost. Marty, instead, spent all spring as a scribe for Jo
because, let’s face it, writing words is hard work and why write them
when you can just speak them to somebody else who’ll write them for you?
Apropos of nothing, thanks again Chris Smith for helping me write this
series.

The consequences of this are borne out in Lucy Mack Smith's personal
memoir on page 132, where she claimed that two-thirds of Marty's crop
was lost. Plus, Joe and Emma were living off Marty's dime during the
entire time Marty worked as his scribe, which adds up after a while,
especially after just losing a season. This began the long and painful
process of Joseph Smith bleeding Martin Harris completely dry over
years.

Tradition says they translated about 116 pages-- although it may have
actually been more than that-- and then Martin Harris asked to borrow
the manuscript to take it home to show his skeptical wife. Somehow the
manuscript disappeared from Martin’s desk drawer. The most popular
theory is that his wife, Lucy, burned it, although that’s hotly disputed
among historians and only emerges as the story much later than the
actual event. It may have also been a test by Marty as he’d tested Jo’s
abilities multiple times. Eps 3 and 4. Joe was devastated, and he took a
long break from translation. When he started translating again, he
picked up from where he had left off rather than starting over from the
beginning. Only when he got to the end of the book did he go back and
replace the lost pages, mostly as an autobiography.

The lost manuscript pages posed a problem, because Joe couldn’t
perfectly reproduce what he’d originally written, and for all he knew,
the manuscript was still out there. If he just tried to rewrite the same
thing, then somebody could produce the original manuscript and point out
discrepancies between the replacement pages and the original. At least,
that was his way of dealing with this trouble. Fortunately for Joe, God
had a plan to solve this problem. According to Jo, he had previously
translated from the “large plates of Lehi,” but there was another set of
plates called the “small plates of Nephi” which told the same story in
abbreviated form from the perspective of Nephi instead of his dad, Lehi.
So he could just translate that. This is the part in the South Park
episode on Joseph Smith where Stan bursts out, “Wait: Mormons actually
know this story, and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?” On
a personal note, that was my first shelf-item at the impressionable age
of 14. Historians Christopher Smith and Dan Vogel did a 2-part
deconstruction of everything South Park got right and wrong, you can
find it on YouTube.

The replacement pages for the lost 116 pages serve as an interesting
case-study for Jo’s authorship methodology. The replacement was an
abridged or shorter version of events already described in the lost
pages, but he uses a ton of “filler” material and a considerable amount
is autobiographical with names of characters only slightly changed.
Isaac Hale became Ishmael and Nephi sounds like his father’s name Lehi
like Jo sr. and Jo jr., Nephi has 2 older brothers with a younger
brother named Samuel just like Jo. It’s remarkable. But it isn’t just
the autobiographical tendencies; in the replacement pages, he copies
chapter after chapter of Isaiah verbatim from the King James Version of
the Bible. And then at some point he runs out of steam and breezes over
hundreds of years of Nephite history in the short books of Enos, Jarom,
Omni, and Words of Mormon, each of which is only one chapter long. These
are the minor prophets of the BoM and each chapter essentially describes
the plates being transferred from one prophet-historian to the next with
very little other material. Jerald and Sandra Tanner, two of the great
critics of the LDS Church, call this the “black hole” in the Book of
Mormon. And basically this “black hole” exists because Martin lost the
original manuscript and Jo’s replacement was under a time crunch and
hopelessly simplistic and lazy. Ep 17.

After the publication of the Book of Mormon, in April 1830 Joe founded
the Church of Christ. That’s the same year the fountain pen was
patented. Throughout this whole period, Jo was dictating (dictating, not
writing for himself) revelations from God that eventually were compiled
to be the Book of Commandments, later republished as the Doctrine and
Covenants with some extra theological material known as the lectures on
faith. Each of these revelations are self-serving; some more than
others. As David Michael and I went through the revelations on My Book
of Mormon podcast before Marie took over for David, we figured out
pretty quickly that Jo essentially established revelations as a
currency. When he wanted somebody to do something for him or the church,
they’d get a revelation, some of which were identical copy-paste
revelations given to different people. One of those revelations that I
find extremely revealing of Joe’s mentality as he established this new
religion of his is D\&C 24, dated July 1830, so three to four months
after Joe founded the church. The revelation is addressed directly to
Joe, and it says,

> For thou shalt devote all thy service in Zion. . . . \[But\] in
> temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy
> calling. Attend to thy calling and thou shalt have wherewith to
> magnify thine office, and to expound all scriptures.

God told Joe temporal work is not your strong suit, so instead you
should devote yourself entirely to the hard spiritual work of explaining
scripture. From watching circuit rider preachers collecting money during
revivals to authoring his own revelation that his time should be devoted
to the church and only the church, the cycle continues through another
conman.

It’s not hard to see what he’s doing here. When you take on a project
like starting a church, or, for example, creating, editing and producing
a podcast on the history of said church, it's a lot easier to focus on
that one thing when you don't have a day-job. Joe was able to swear off
all physical labor for money, and tell everybody that his church was to
be his one and only focus. He, however, did so by claimed divine command
instead of starting a gofundme for a history book he has yet to deliver
on… Uhhh… that was a little too real. Chris, did you write that? MOVING
ON\!

Another passage within that same section of the D\&C hearkens to Jo’s
previous troubles with the law while simultaneously reinforcing his
reliance on the tithes of the church for support.

> And whosoever shall go to law with thee shall be cursed by the law.
> 
> And thou shalt take no purse nor scrip, neither staves, neither two
> coats, for the church shall give unto thee in the very hour what thou
> needest for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for money, and for
> scrip.

Hey Jo, can you help me lift this thing? Come on, Ollie, you know what
the big man upstairs thinks about me lifting a thing. By the way, we
need more tithing cuz Joey needs a new wardrobe\! Mormons often consider
the phrase “Oh my god\!” is taking the lord’s name in vain, but when a
guy tells his hundreds of followers that god said he doesn’t have to
work for money, I can’t think of a greater example of taking the Lord’s
name in vain. It’s a stark contrast from the claims church leaders make
today that the church is run by a lay clergy while they take living
stipends Jo would have salivated over and sit on a veritable dragon’s
hoard of wealth of over $100 billion. It’s vanity, hypocrisy, and it’s
all rooted in an indescribable loathing of manual labor and honest work.

Once Jo arrived in Kirtland after commanding his church to relocate to
Ohio and Missouri, this trend of god giving Jo the cakewalk through life
accelerated. In June 1831, that’s the same year Clement Studebaker
(Studebaker cars) was born. I WANT AN AVANTI SO BAD. I WAAAANT ONE\!\!\!
The 63 R3 model, only 1,200 made with the supercharged 304 4-speed. It
could do 180 mph in the early 60s, are you frickin kidding me?\! If you
have one, call me. I digress. In June 1831, Joseph Smith was in
Kirtland, but he had been prophesying that the “New Jerusalem” or “Zion”
would be located in Missouri. This was basically the Mormon promised
land, but Joe hadn’t actually been there yet; he’d only described it in
letters. Unfortunately, his powers of remote viewing with a seer stone
didn’t cut it so in June 1831 he decided it was time that he went and
saw it for himself to properly declare it Zion. He received a revelation
that commanded twenty-eight elders to travel to Missouri. One of those
elders was Ezra Booth. This experience ended up being so disillusioning
for Booth that he left the Church and wrote the first insider’s expose
of the church. See the exclusive feed on patreon.com/nakedmormonism
where we read through the Ezra Booth letters in Mormonism Unvailed for
our NaMo book club.

According to Booth, Joe’s revelation told the elders to go to Missouri
on foot. Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Martin Harris, and Edward
Partridge, however, were told to go by carriage and steamboat, funded
largely by NSSMarty. The leaders traveled in comfort, while the laymen
begged their way to Missouri like hobos. Hey, at least that survived to
the modern church.

When Joe got to the holy land, he was extremely disappointed. He found
about 20 log cabins, mostly occupied by drunks. Only a handful of people
had converted to Mormonism. According to Booth, “We expected to find a
large Church, which Smith said, was revealed to him in a vision, Oliver
had raised up there. This large Church was found to consist of three or
four females.” Priorities, right Ezra?

To Ezra Booth’s great disappointment, the whole trip ended up being
pointless. Joe laid the foundation of the temple, which was fine, but it
wasn’t worth walking all the way to Missouri to see. And then Joe was
done with this backwater, and he returned to Kirtland, Ohio. According
to Booth, “Before they went to Missouri, \[Joseph Smith’s\] language
was, ‘we shall winter in Ohio but one winter more.’” But once they got
to Missouri, Joseph changed his tune and declared that “’it will be many
years before we come here," for there is a great work to be done first.
Eps 25, 26.

Booth’s explanation of why Joe returned to Kirtland and left building up
Zion to other people was that “it is much easier, and better suited to
their dispositions, to write commandments \[in Kirtland\], than to gain
a livelihood by the sweat of their brow \[in Missouri\]; and indeed,
Smith has commanded himself not to labor, and by his mandate, has
enjoined it upon the Church to support him. \[Bishop Edward Partridge\],
when we were in Missouri, intimated, that \[Smith\] and others were too
much inclined to \[laziness\]. \[Smith\] replied, ‘I am commanded not to
labor.’” A few quotes from Jo throughout this series really encapsulate
his entire life in so few words like this one. Last week it was the
quote about building the Nauvoo House hotel so that the rich people will
pour their gold and silver into the community until the Mormons are sick
of receiving them. This quote, however, summarizes his work ethic, his
manipulation tactics, his lethargy towards honest labor, and his taking
god’s name in vain for little crap like this throughout his entire
ministry. It’s a remarkable quote and it’s amazing to make a
tongue-in-cheek example about god commanding Jo not to do a thing and
then to have a contemporary who left the church say that exact thing
happened. It shows us today that Jo not only used God’s name to tell him
not to work, but would also quote that revelation to people when he was
in a situation that required him to actually work. His job was talking
to god and anybody who didn’t like it wasn’t faithful to the work and
therefore didn’t believe Jo actually spoke for god. It becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy because anybody regarding these statements with
skepticism, like Ezra Booth, simply leave and the only people left are
the sycophants who’d never question the prophet of god or anything the
prophet claimed god said.

While Joe lived at Kirtland, the Church in Missouri had a series of
troubles with their non-Mormon Missourian neighbors. We’ll discuss this
in coming episodes at length but for now we need to understand that one
of the major sources of tension was the fact that the Missourians were
mostly from the South, whereas the Mormons were mostly from the North,
so they had different attitudes toward the enslavement of black people.
The Book of Mormon is anti-slavery. The Nephites outlawed slavery,
whereas the “ferocious and wicked” Lamanites practiced slavery. In 1832
Joe received his famous civil war revelation, which predicted that a
civil war would begin in South Carolina, and slaves would rise against
their masters. This revelation was not disclosed to the public, because
it was too explosive and the reaction from non-Mormons would not have
been good. It does, however, illustrate to us that Jo kept his eye on
current events for anything he could wrap into his theology or could
demonstrate his feigned powers of prophecy.

In 1833, W. W. Phelps published a newspaper article in which he advised
against free people of color emigrating to Missouri as members of the
Church, because they’d be considered property there. Unfortunately the
Missourians misinterpreted the article as an invitation to free people
of color to emigrate, and the reaction was violent. The racist citizens
of Jackson County, Missouri expelled the Mormons from the county in
1833.

Unfortunately, this bad reaction from the Missourians sent Joe into PR
damage control mode, and he showed zero moral backbone by changing his
stance on slavery. The Church issued an official declaration in August
1835 that said the North had no “right to interfere with bond-servants,
nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters” nor
cause “them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life.” And
in April 1836, just a year later, coincidentally the same year Samuel
Colt patented the revolving cylinder pistol, Joe published an
anti-abolitionist sermon that warned that abolitionism might lead to
“racial miscegenation and possible race war.” He also said it was the
“decree of Jehovah” that blacks be slaves. GBP Eps 48, 49. Put a pin
in Jo’s stance on slavery because we’ll discuss it in a minute.

Richard Bushman summarized Jo’s general work ethic quite well in his
biography, *Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling*. Bushman is a believing
Mormon, but to his credit he actually admits to Joseph Smith’s flaws and
remains in good-standing with the church after publishing about
controversial aspects of Jo’s life in this book. Speaking about the
Kirtland years, he says, “How the Smiths paid the bills in these years
is a mystery. Joseph’s journal shows no evidence of working for money.
In 1834, he had been granted the stewardship of a farm near the temple
site, but he recorded no income or benefit. He never mentioned doing
farm work or supervising anyone’s labors. Later he opened a store in
Kirtland, but the store was not profitable. Joseph’s followers helped by
bringing food—half a fattened hog from John Tanner, a quarter beef from
Shadrach Roundy. Others gave Joseph money or forgave borrowed sums.”

Jo’s financial profile in Kirtland is troubled at best. I know we talk
about his finances a lot on the show but it’s kind of a recurring theme
when so many of his actions were motivated by money. He ran his church
on credit and did so while constructing the largest building in the
city, the Kirtland Temple. By the time it completed construction, Jo had
no way to pay off the $40-60k in debt he incurred. He’d absorbed by
divine fiat all the businesses of wealthy members by declaring the
church a socialist system run through Bishops’ storehouses and land
speculation was a common pastime. Jo could issue a revelation commanding
the Mormons to forgive him of his debts, but that solution didn’t
exactly hold water like a tight dish for people who didn’t believe he
was a prophet, which were the majority of people to which the dude owed
money.

When you run out of money and creditors are beating down your door, what
do you do? Start your own bank and print your own money. Who needs to
labor extensively and pay down debts through hard labor and ethical
business practices when you can simply make money and sell stocks in the
Kirtland Safety Society anti-bank-ing company? This worked for a while,
but the inert bank notes eventually caught up and lawsuits were filed,
judgments declared church property into the hands of creditors, and Jo
and the leadership fled to the Missouri church under the cover of night.
Jo running from his problems was a common tactic when life became too
hard to work through them.

When Jo got to Missouri, he wasn’t there for very long, and things were
pretty intense for most of the time he was there.

Here’s a good time to talk about one of the primary tensions between the
Mormons and the Missourians which had been brewing for over half a
decade. Let’s pull that pin out of Jo’s stance on slavery now. The
Mormons came from largely Northern states, which meant most of them were
either abolitionist or generally not pro-slavery. Missouri has always
been a controversial state when it comes to race relations. To this day,
it’s one of the most racially-charged states in America owing to it
being the northernmost slave state above the Mason-Dixon line which
delineated between slave states of the south and non-slave states of the
north. The most infamous supreme court ruling in American history, the
Dred Scott decision, centered around whether or not the Scotts were
considered citizens, having lived in northern states where slavery was
illegal and then moved to Missouri. This 1857 case is a blight on
American jurisprudence and in many ways served as one of the primary
catalysts that resulted in the civil war half a decade later. This all
occurred while Mormon Utah was a slave-holding theocracy, but I digress.
Needless to say, tensions about the slave issue plagued Mormon and
Missourian relations and when the Mormons published from their Jackson
County-based The Evening and the Morning Star that they’d teach freed
slaves how to read by offering them fellowship and Book of Mormon study
classes, the slave holders in Missouri lost their minds. This was in
addition to a number of controversial revelations given by Jo which
caused these tensions to increase. These revelations claimed the
gentile’s property, meaning that of the non-Mormons in Missouri, was
to be consecrated to the bishop’s storehouse, which is a nice way to
package the concept of theft. Also, Jackson County was to be the central
location of the Mormon millennium, meaning the number of Mormons living
there would only increase. More Mormons resulted in them having greater
political power, which, once again, could threaten the way of life of
the slave-holders. Missourians didn’t want their government filled with
a bunch of abolitionist yankees who were trying to teach freed slaves
how to read, possibly leading to an uprising.

All of that is to say that slavery was an issue Jo repeatedly changed
his stance on throughout his ministry. It can be easily demonstrated
that his statements about states’ rights vs. slavery were influenced by
current events and what happened to the Mormons in Missouri. First of
these stances was indifference. Passages from Alma 27 and Mosiah 2 are
inherently anti-slavery, however, as the Mormons settled in greater
numbers in Missouri, Jo remained silent on these passages and the entire
subject of slavery. It wasn’t until W. W. Phelps published a pamphlet
titled “Free people of color” in Missouri that the leadership made a
statement about slavery. It extensivley quoted Missouri law in stating
“no free negro or mulatto… shall come into or settle in this state
under any pretext whatever…” and further made the official stance of the
church that “Slaves are real estate in this and other states, and wisdom
would dictate great care among the branches of the Church of Christ on
this subject. So long as we have no special rule in the Church, as to
people of color, let prudence guide… Shun every appearance of evil.”
Phelps said we’re pro state’s rights until we have a special rule in the
church, leaving the door open for Jo to issue a revelation claiming
slavery is evil, but Jo didn’t. He never claimed god said anything
negative about slavery during his actual ministry. In fact, he took the
opposite stance in his 1836 letter we put the pin in before that we’ll
read from in a minute. His anti-slavery stance was purely political and
never carried the weight of “thus saith the Lord” like most of his
revelations.

The appearance of this 1833 article from Double-dub Phelps caused fire
and fury as it was coupled with rumors of the revelation which later
became D\&C 87, which stated “war will be poured out upon all nations
beginning at \[South Carolina\]... slaves shall rise up against their
masters… the remnants \[Native Americans\]... will marshal themselves,
and… shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation.” Missourians construed
the Free People of Color statement with the rumors of this revelation as
exactly what they needed to consider the Mormons their enemies. Phelps
published a clarifying statement in the next issue of the Star; an
attempt to allay the excitement.

> Having learned with extreme regret, that an article entitled, "Free
> People of Color," in the last number of the Star, has been
> misunderstood, we feel in duty bound to stare, in this Extra, that our
> intention was not only to stop free people of color from emigrating to
> this state, but to prevent them from being admitted as members of the
> Church...We often lament the situation of our sister states in the

> and spill innocent blood, for they are ignorant, and a little may lead
> them to disturb the peace of society. To be short, we are opposed to
> having free people of color admitted into the state; and we say, that
> none will be admitted into the Church;

This was the racism of the day. The leadership of the church, especially
Joseph Smith, had an opportunity to stick to their Book of Mormon and
oppose slavery and invite African-Americans to join their church; they
could have been on the right side of history and taken the moral stance
on the hottest moral and political issue of the day. Instead, they
prohibited blacks from joining the church to appease slave-holders. Even
with this tacit approval of slavery and prohibition of freed slaves from
joining the church, the Missourian public sentiment against the church
had been adjudicated in the court of public opinion and the Mormons had
to go.

One may be tempted to say that these were the public statements of W.W.
Phelps as editor of the church’s periodical and therefore don’t reflect
Jo’s personal beliefs on the question of slavery and racism. Well, let’s
talk about Jo’s 1836 letter. An abolitionist visited Kirtland in 1836
and Jo’s lethargy toward the slave question would no longer suffice. He
sent a letter to the editor of the Kirtland-based Messenger and
Advocate, who was Oliver Cowdery at the time. Jo’s letter details that
the abolitionist preaching in Kirtland was mostly ignored and “attended
to their own avocations and left the gentleman to hold forth his own
arguments to nearly naked walls.” Mormons ignoring the pressing social
issues of their day, or being on the wrong side of them, is a long
tradition that apparently started back in Kirtland. Jo goes on to lament
how much members bichor over the question of slavery and attempt to
withdraw fellowship from those who join the church but hold slaves. He’s
saddened that people will join the cry of abolition and “set loose, upon
the world a community of people \[slaves\] who might peradventure,
overrun our country and violate the most sacred principles of human
society,”. You can’t trust slaves to free themselves or they might
overrun the entire nation and violate society as we know it. Wouldn’t
that just be a shame for white society to endure in the 1830s.

Jo deals the killing blow with this:

> It may, no doubt, with propriety be said, that many who hold slaves
> live without the fear of God before their eyes, and, the same may be
> said of many in the free states. Then who is to be the judge in this
> matter?... \[speaking of abolitionists\] why not cease their clamor,
> and no further urge the slave to acts of murder, and the master to
> vigorous discipline, rendering both miserable… I do not believe that
> the people of the North have any more right to say that the South
> *shall not* hold slaves, than the South have to say the North
> *shall*.”

Jo was pro states’ rights during the burgeoning abolitionist movement.
This is being pro-fascism or pro-eugenics in the 1930s, like President
Heber J. Grant giving a talk in Frankfurt with the Nazi Flag behind him
in 1937. This is a clear example of Jo simply being on the wrong side of
history and human morality; releasing this statement was an act of
pacification to not infuriate the Missourians against the growing number
of Mormons in the state. This is so infuriating to yours truly. Joseph
Smith was supposed to be the paragon of morality. He had god on speed
dial and claimed he could see the future but when it came to one of the
most basic questions of human morality, nay human *decency*, he
abdicated his place as the moral high point of humanity and sided with
the people who own other people as property. What the hell good is a
prophet of god if he tells us to violate the very essence of what makes
us human, autonomy and freedom of choice? On the slave question, Jo was
an anchor holding the boat of human morality under water during a
hurricane at high tide.

But, Jo didn’t stop there; if he did it would be absolutely barbaric and
openly opportunist, but he had plenty more to say. He went on to recite
the same Bible passages used by pro-slavery advocates quoting Genesis
and Paul. He then trots out the white-supremacy of the curse of Cain so
eloquently captured in his own books of Mormon, Moses, and soon to be
written Abraham.

Those who interfere with slavery are going against God’s will and are
under condemnation before him. The Curse of Cain will not be lifted
until some calamitous event that removes the curse of dark skin equal
with the same power which gave them dark skin to begin with. Joseph
Smith was a white supremacist. I recently gave a presentation to the
U.K. group Skeptics in the Pub about Mormonism and white supremacy and
cited all Jo’s relevant revelations on the subject. Joseph Smith wasn’t
just a racist, he was a white supremacist. May that statement never fall
on deaf ears. Any claim to the contrary is factually wrong. Joseph Smith
saw white skin as pure and delightsome while dark skin was the curse of
Cain. He spoke officially as the prophet of God, quoted extensively from
the Bible to justify slavery, and said anybody opposing slavery is under
condemnation from God. Joseph Smith wasn’t just a racist, he was a white
supremacist. He wasn’t even a progressive of his day on the issue of
slavery, he was a weathervane going with the political wind of the day.
This guy speaks for god and his god is incontrovertably a white
supremacist. If you believe Jo was a prophet, why is the god he
supposedly received direction from worthy of worship? The curse Jo
claimed has never been lifted in Mormon theology. Black men can have the
priesthood as of 1978 but the curse is still very much alive and well in
white supremacist Mormon scripture.

Now, people will quote Jo’s presidential pamphlet which advocated for
the release of slaves and a government bailout for slave holders and say
that is evidence of Jo being on the right side of the issue. They’re
disgustingly wrong. As a prophet of God he used the Bible to claim
slavery was the way god created the world, as a POTUS candidate he
didn’t use the Bible to justify abolition, in spite of the many
Christian abolitionists who did as his contemporaries. He was pro
abolition as a POTUS candidate because his political enemies were
Southern Democrats after the Missouri-Mormon War. He had many chances,
over a decade of chances, to issue a new revelation that slavery was
evil. He could have taken the actual moral stance on the greatest social
justice issue of his day, but he didn’t. He only switched to
abolitionism because it was politically advantageous, which is the
absolute laziest and morally bankrupt system by which to determine one’s
morals. If your morals are determined based on what will get you
elected, you’re a spineless coward and lazy. Jo was the worst kind of
white supremacist, the lazy religious kind, which, if I’m being honest,
is the majority of white supremacists. Ep 165.

I want to dwell on this point for a minute longer at risk of belaboring
the point, but it’s so incredibly crucial and possibly the most
important takeaway from today’s episode. The Mormons were largely
northerners, who were either opposed to or indifferent towards slavery.
Jo’s 1836 letter to the editor illustrates an aspect of Jo’s inert
mentality toward social ills of his day. In slave-holding America, not
having an opinion on the issue of slavery was the same as having an
opinion on it. Jo took the state’s rights side of the issue. He was not
only on the wrong side of history by taking this pro-slavery stance, he
was on the wrong side of humanity. What was it that garnered this letter
being written in the first place? Political pressure from pro-slavery
Missouri. Jo didn’t want to inflame tensions with slaveholders any more
than the Mormons had in the previous 5 years so he published this rant
about how awesome and divinely-ordained slavery is because he was afraid
of what the Missourians might do to the Mormons. This isn’t just lazy,
it’s deplorable. Believers will often claim that Jo was an abolitionist
citing his 1844 Presidential Campaign Pamphlet as evidence but that only
underscores the point that he flip-flopped on the question of slavery
only when it was politically advantageous. Joseph Smith used the same
biblical passages slaveowners used to justify owning those slaves to say
that slavery was commanded by god. He adopted the political stance of
the Confederacy nearly 20 years before it existed. If there was a single
issue where Jo could prophecy of the future and take the right side of a
moral issue, slavery was that issue. To be a state’s rights person in
the 1830s was the same side as separate but equal prior to the end of
segregation. He was on the wrong side while simultaneously claiming to
be the mouthpiece of god. This example alone casts into question the
stance of the church on every social justice issue during its existence.
Bloody Brigham Young fought for Utah to be a slave territory barely a
decade before the civil war. Today’s leaders are viciously opposed to
LGBTQ+ rights, keeping with this same trend of lethargy towards the
often unpopular but moral stance on social issues. Granted, abolishing
slavery and legal gay marriage are far from the same thing, but
opposition to them comes from the same religiously bigoted place and Jo
was no moral stalwart of his day in spite of the near deification his
legacy enjoys in the church today. He was as slothful as any politician
seeking popular approval; garnering support by playing into, instead of
against, people’s basest fears and prejudices. Not only was Jo’s work
ethic lazy, but his own morality was lazy. This single data point really
highlights the way I opened this episode. A person operating from a
moral compass given to them by divine decree will always be morally
inferior to somebody who puts the work into shaping their own moral
compass from consequential ethicism and other categories of
philosophical morality. The cult leader and follower may be the most
active and industrious person you meet, but at the end of the day their
minds have atrophied from lack of use and critical examination of the
world around them. Any way you examine Jo, from his moral ethics, to his
business practices, to his general work ethic, he was the epitome of
indolence.

I had to get that off my chest and I could spend the entire episode on
just this but we must soldier forth. In spite of being pro-slavery when
Jo fled Kirtland for Missouri, tensions eventually climaxed between the
Mormons and anti-Mormon Missourians throughout the year of 1838.

One of the big things that kicked off the Missouri Mormon War was Sidney
Rigdon’s militant preaching. Mormons always talk about the
“extermination order” that the governor of Missouri issued, but
actually it was Sidney Rigdon who first used the word “extermination” in
Missouri. On the 4th of July in 1838, he gave a sermon which has become
infamous in Mormon history. I called this the Red Sermon on Episode 43
because, in many ways, it was a catalyst for the impending
Missouri-Mormon War.

> And that mob that comes on us to disturb us; it shall be between us
> and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them till the last
> drop of their blood is spilled, or else they will have to exterminate
> us: for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses, and their
> own families, and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed.

Not only threatening people, but threatening their homes and families.
Why didn’t the Missourians like the Mormons again? If Joe really had the
insight of a prophet, he could have stood up after Rigdon’s sermon and
said something to calm the crowd and correct what Rigdon had just said.
Instead, Joe got up and endorsed Hingepin Rigdon’s message. His failure
to rein Rigdon in was at best incompetent. When his people were on the
precipice of civil war, he let his second-in-command take control of the
church and influence his decisions which caused the Haun’s Mill Massacre
and the suffering of thousands of Mormons during the expulsion from the
state. He could have stepped in at any time. He could have denounced the
more radical members of his leadership like the Wild Ram of the
Mountains, Lyman Wight, or Captain Fearnaught David W. Patten, or
Hingepin Sidney Rigdon. Instead Jo let his people spiral out of control
through inaction and incompetence, but all of that is true only if we
believe the apologist narrative of the Missouri-Mormon War. I, on the
other hand, tend to believe Jo was among the radicals and fed into the
fire and fury which caused that spiraling out of control which led to so
much suffering.

On a similar note, there was a Mormon paramilitary organization called
“the Danites” that bullied members into conformity, harassed elected
officials and forced them to sign documents under duress, and even
murdered dissenters of the faith. Joe later blamed the Danites on
Sampson Avard and claimed that he himself had no idea of all the nasty
things the Danites were up to. This, however, was only after Sampson
Avard defected during the height of the Missouri-Mormon war and filed
affidavits about the existence of the Danites which led to the Mormon
extermination order by Governor Boggs. Well, I don’t buy Jo’s
deflections and casting blame for a second. Eps 44, 45, 46

Even if we look at the massacre at Haun’s Mill itself, Jo’s incompetence
and inaction, coupled with his fire and brimstone speeches throughout
1838, led to the deaths of 18 Mormons. There was a small Mormon
community around a mill owned by a guy named Jacob Haun. The community
was attacked by a group of rogue Missouri militia soldiers, and the
soldiers massacred the Mormons, including women and children, and
mutilated some of the bodies. In perhaps the worst moment of the
massacre, as described by historian Stephen LeSueur, “the Missourians
found ten-year-old Sardius Smith hiding under the \[blacksmith’s\]
bellows. Young Smith, whose father lay mortally wounded on the floor,
begged for his life, but William Reynolds of Livingston County put a gun
to the boy’s head and blew off the top. ‘Nits will make lice, and if he
had lived he would have become a Mormon,’ Reynolds reportedly said in
justification of his act.” It was a heinous crime and a brutal human
tragedy; it all happened because of Jo’s actions or lack thereof.

Simply put, this would have been a good time for Joseph to use his
prophetic abilities to know the situation before it occurred. Joseph did
warn the people of Haun’s Mill that they might be in danger, as they
were the furthest Mormon settlement away from the twin city headquarters
of Far West and Adam-ondi-Ahmen, but instead of calling for them to
flee, he told them to use their own judgment and do whatever they
thought best. Thus we see the failing of prophecy, prophets seem to know
everything concerning god’s will and how to best fulfill it, but when it
comes to useful knowledge, like how to save the lives of 18 of his
parishioners, God simply forgot to mention it to Joseph, and Joe failed
to do enough to take a stand, warn, and protect his followers. Episode
48-- but you better be emotionally prepared because it’s some graphic
content.

After the Missouri-Mormon war and the leadership surrendered Eps 49, 50.
The Mormons left the state of Missouri and sought refuge in Illinois.
This move was largely organized by Uncle John Smith and the Quorum of
Apostles under the direction of Bloody Brigham Young. Jo languished in
prison for months while the mess he created was sorted out by his
closest advisors. Eps 51, 52, 53

In order to build Nauvoo, Joe had had to become enterprising and amassed
a lot of responsibility for himself, although none of his
responsibilities involved intensive physical labor. Most of his time was
devoted to riding around areas to scope out land to purchase and signing
his name on contracts.

Jo incurred somewhere in the ballpark of $200k in personal debt signing
all these contracts. That’s over $6 mn in 2020 money. He turned around
and attempted to sell the land to the destitute refugee Mormons at
exorbitant rates or simply gave away choice lots as gifts when people
followed his commands. It takes a special kind of monster to force
thousands of people into destitution by committing treason and then
attempt to make profit off their misery.

However, because the Mormons were so destitute, once the bills started
coming due Jo couldn’t even afford to pay the interest. Drastic measures
were needed to settle the Mormon cash flow problem as it would be years
before they could build the manufacturing infrastructure to benefit from
their location on the Mississippi, the largest shipping river in America
at the time. Instead of committing to hard work, balancing budgets, and
sustainably building Nauvoo, Joe went to Washington, D.C. with hand
extended for a government bailout. Now, I should say here that I am not
opposed to reparations, and in fact I think the government’s failure to
do something to help the Mormons here was a moral failure. My problem is
more with the extremely one-sided picture that Joe painted of what
happened in Missouri, and the enormous $1.2 million sum he asked for,
including $100,000 for himself and another $100k for Hyrum. In total, he
asked for over $41 mn in 2020 money from the federal government. The
request for reparations was mostly designed to pay the enormous debts he
had racked up speculating on real estate in Iowa and Illinois, and I’m
sorry to say that if the federal government had actually paid the
reparations, I’m not sure the actual victims of the Mormon War would
seen very much of that enormous sum of money. There’s a good chance Joe
would have arranged for most of this money to enrich himself and the
Church. Episodes 58 and 61.

This wasn’t the last time that Joe cravenly exploited the suffering of
his followers in Missouri in an attempt to get outside help. He also
called upon the Green Mountain Boys militia of Vermont to join the
Nauvoo Legion to both put down anti-Mormon violence in Illinois and also
help him make Missouri pay for its persecution of the Mormons. Remember,
Jo was dead to rights in Missouri. The state government had him on
arson, robbery, high treason, and murder so he couldn’t step foot in the
state without his own militia or he’d be arrested and hung. He thought
that if he could just burn the whole state to the ground, he wouldn’t
have to deal with the Missouri problem any more. The Nauvoo Legion
wasn’t big enough yet to wage a war without sustaining heavy
casualties, but he thought if the Green Mountain Boys agreed to join
forces to raze the state, he’d lose a lot less of his own militia.

In his letter to the Green Mountain Boys, Joe pulls all the strings of
emotional manipulation, and he’s blatantly dishonest about what happened
in Missouri. He begins by telling them he’s a Vermonter himself, and a
faithful American citizen. Then he launches into his tale of persecution
in Missouri, including the blatant lie that “twelve or fifteen thousand
innocent inhabitants \[were\] murdered, and hundreds expelled, the
residue, at the point of the bayonet, without law, contrary to the
express language of the Constitution of the United States, and every
State in the Union; and contrary to the custom and usage of civilized
nations; and especially one holding up the motto: ‘The asylum of the
oppressed.’” I mean, okay. Hundreds expelled at the point of a bayonet,
sure. But “twelve or fifteen thousand innocent inhabitants murdered?”
The actual casualty count was about 21 people on the Mormon side and a
small handful of Missourians.

I honestly wonder if this is an example of Joe’s “Yankee wit,” where
he’d say something that’s technically true, but deliberately designed
to be misunderstood; lying resides in the intent even if the statement
may be true. For example, Joe’s New York neighbor, Peter Ingersoll, says
that Joe once told a toll collector that he didn’t have money to pay the
toll, so he’d hand him double on the way back. The toll collector agreed
to this deal, and on the way back, Joe did hand him double. The toll
collector didn’t recognize Joe, and he gave him half the amount as
change. Afterward, Peter Ingersoll asked Joe, didn’t you promise to pay
double on the way back? And Joe said, no, I promised to *hand* him
double. This was technically true but the intent was to mislead; the
intent was a lie.

Now apply the same logic to this letter to the Green Mountain Boys. Joe
says twelve or fifteen thousand people were murdered in Missouri. It
sounds like he’s saying that between 12,000 people and 15,000 people
were murdered in Missouri. But you could also interpret this statement
as saying that between 12 people and 15,000 people were murdered in
Missouri. Joe *loved* these kinds of word games, so it would not at all
surprise me if that was what went through his mind when he wrote this
outrageous claim.

He goes on to the objective of the proposed expedition:

> With all these facts before me, and a pure desire to ameliorate the
> condition of the poor and unfortunate among men, and, if possible, to
> entice all men from evil to good, and with firm reliance that God will
> reward the just, I have been stimulated to call upon my native State,
> for a "union of all honest men;" and to appeal to the valor of the
> "Green Mountain Boys" by all honorable methods & means to assist me in
> obtaining justice from Missouri: not only for the property she has
> stolen and confiscated, the murders she has committed among my
> friends, and for our expulsion from the State, but also to humble and
> chastise, or abase her for the disgrace she has brought upon
> constitutional liberty, until she atones for her sins.

Jo wanted revenge. This also played into his larger plans to unify freed
slaves and oppressed Natives into his Nauvoo Legion to overthrow the
United States Government and instate his Mormon theocracy. However, if
he could get these Green Mountain Boys to start the fight for him and
take the brunt of the opening casualties, that was obviously preferable
to the American Muhammed.

He goes on to manipulate the Green Mountain Boys with a gish gallop of
noble-sounding lies. He claims that his father served in several battles
of the American Revolution (when he was five years old?) and had to
watch his comrades in arms shot dead in Missouri. He claims his brother
Don Carlos died of exposure and fatigue, when in fact he died because he
was working in a dark and mildew-filled basement churning out propaganda
as editor of the Times & Seasons, not because of anything he suffered
during the exodus to Illinois. He claims his mother has permanent
problems from the trauma, which is fair because all the Mormons had
experienced the traumatic events resulting from Jo’s decisions, and he
also claims his Missouri jailers tried to feed him human flesh, which
there’s also no evidence of. But, the whole point of this letter is to
weave a persecution narrative and we can’t let pesky facts get in the
way of good propaganda. Facts weren’t in the cards because Jo was a
parasite. He could only survive by attaching to others and sucking them
dry like a leech. Episode 181.

An aspect of Jo’s character that bears examination is his dictatorial
proclivities. Rarely did he write anything, instead he dictated it.
Rarely did he fix problems himself, he delegated problems to be solved
by others. He rarely wrote his own propaganda for the church, he had a
team of propaganda specialists tasked with spewing constant twisted
truths from the Nauvoo printer’s mill. He didn’t even write his own
presidential campaign pamphlet, something he should have been the
foremost expert on, he instead had it ghost-written by W.W. Phelps. If a
task needed to be completed, Jo dictated it to somebody who considered
him the prophet of god. Notably as well, when problems cropped up, he
was far more likely to run away than confront. He was not only a coward,
but a lazy coward. These are traits of a good CEO that deserves respect
for what they build, but Jo didn’t build anything himself and therefore
doesn’t deserve respect. The force of his will wasn’t “do this thing
because it’s what the company needs,” Jo’s MO was “do this thing because
god commands you to do it. You wouldn’t question the mind and will of
the Lord on this, would you?” That isn’t respectable, it’s pathetic.

As a microcosm of these character traits, I offer the Nauvoo Expositor
issue as a prime example. William Law formed his own church in the city
of Nauvoo, called the leadership to repentance, called for reformation
in the church, and then published the scathing expose known as the
Nauvoo Expositor with 6 co-printers and an editor. Jo claimed the paper
was full of slander and libel. The right thing to do would be to sue the
printers and get an injunction against them printing more issues until
the case was settled or a verdict was reached. However, suing the
printers would require discovering the extent to which its claims were
slanderous or actually true. Because the printers were very careful
about what they published, Jo knew it was full of truths and he would
lose the slander case. Truth is an absolute defense in slander cases and
Jo wouldn’t survive an impartial hearing. His church would be tossed
into chaos as the popular media ran stories about the hearings and
statements from witnesses which proved polygamy was going on and that
the Mormon empire was amassing too much political wealth, thereby
infringing on the separation of church and state.

Instead of going through all the time and effort of these legal troubles
and waging multiple campaigns of character assassination against the
printers, Jo took the easy way out and ordered the press destroyed which
led to his eventual arrest and vigilante execution. Episode 200. The
Church the Expositor printers formed posed an existential threat to Jo’s
church; in a jealous bid for power he instead took a scorched-earth
approach to their dissent, audaciously thinking himself untouchable in
such a criminal act. His gluttony for women was something he had to lie
about and silence any threat of public exposure, which proved to be his
ultimate downfall.

Indolent and work-shy for any task which couldn’t be delegated to a
lackey, shiftless and inert in his own morals stating whatever was
merely popular and would gain him followers and retweets, torpid when
his people needed him the most as refugees sick and dying in the
swampland on the banks of the Mississippi, loafing about and asking for
government handouts instead of working to pay his debts and learn how to
balance a budget, utterly apathetic to establish a hardline stance on
basic issues of morality like whether or not it’s alright to own humans
as property, careless and neglectful about the suffering of his
followers and indifferent about the plight of those oppressed by a
slave-holding society, privileged and resting on the laurels of a
white-supremacist nation, he held absolute contempt for the rule of law
by which society abides in lieu of simply doing whatever he wanted;
Joseph Smith was a lazy man.

He built cities, wrote books, was editor of multiple newspapers, formed
his own armies, ran hundreds of businesses throughout his life, seldom
had any time to help raise his children because each day was occupied
with founding a religion; he fought a war, started a university, wrote
multiple books of scripture, was a father and husband and husband and
husband and husband and husband and husband, fought dissenters; are
these the attributes of a lazy man? YES\! The entire premise of this
episode has been that people can be physically industrious and busy
every waking moment of every day but remain the laziest parasites of
society. Simultaneously, a person who thinks about the world in which
they live, deals with the hardest questions that face our shared human
existence; what’s the purpose of life, what’s the most moral outcome of
the given situation, how do I reduce suffering in the world, how does
one person make the world a better place for the most people, the person
who ponders these questions spending their life consuming information,
never hammering a nail, milking a cow, plumbing a house, or doing any
housework can be the most ambitious and energetic human alive. A Cult
leader or follower are the most active lazy people around; a philosopher
is the least active hard worker society can offer. The efforts of one
contribute only to the maintenance and expansion of an exclusive group,
the efforts of the other contribute to the betterment of humanity.

A cult leader like Joseph Smith thrives on lies being accepted without
critical examination, spread through intellectual contagion to those
without an intellectual immune system equipped to evaluate those lies. A
skeptic, a critical thinker, a scientist, a philosopher, this person
thrives on gathering more information and never ceasing that quest. A
cult leader’s job is complete when a person gives their life to the
cult, a philosopher’s job is complete when they realize their job is
never complete. When the prophet speaks, the thinking has been done.
When a scientist speaks, the thinking is perpetuated. When the cult
leader is wrong about something, the adversary’s grasp on the world is
more realized; when a philosopher is wrong about something, they realize
the issue is more complex than they initially thought and their thoughts
grow and adapt to understand that information in a broader context. For
the cult leader, the world is always what they know; for the scientist,
the world is comprised of unknown unknowns. The cult leader is moved by
arrogance and limited information, the philosopher by humility and
expanding information. One can only exist by virtue of people’s
intellectual idleness, the other’s existence is solely devoted to
tirelessly ridding people of their intellectual idleness.

From treasure digging to petitioning the government for a bailout, Jo’s
