It’s the morning of June 27, 1844. Emma awoke to the sound of kids
running through the house and doing children things. She’s 5 months
pregnant and needs her rest, but it was a night of tossing and turning.
There are too many unknowns. Her husband and brother-in-law are interred
in Carthage Jail. Intelligence is constantly working its way into Nauvoo
about the nearby cities gearing up for war. The Nauvoo Legion has been
disbanded and disarmed, but that’s officially. Unofficially, they’re
ready to go at a moment’s notice, whether to defend the city, break
their supreme leader out of jail, or loot and pillage local non-Mormon
villages.

Joseph had wanted Emma to leave town with the kids. He wanted them to
either head to Washington D.C. where Emma would meet with President John
Tyler and tell him the plight of her husband and the Mormons at large,
or begin the journey west where the saints would follow close behind.
Emma knew she was a target as Jo’s publicly-known wife and being
pregnant only complicated matters further. Plans were rushing in and out
of her mind. If everything blew up, she’d need an escape plan to keep
her and the kids safe while her husband worked out his escape plan. It
had happened in Missouri, it happened in Dixon, Illinois last year, and
the time seemed to be approaching that Emma would have to handle her
family and the church in her husband’s absence until he could extricate
himself from the present troubles. Her words to the prophet ring deep
and provide a window into Emma’s mind at this troubling time during yet
another hard pregnancy.

> I desire prudence that I may not through ambition abuse my body and
> cause it to become prematurely old and care-worn, but that I may wear
> a cheerful countenance, live to perform all the work that I covenanted
> to perform in the spirit-world and be a blessing to all who may in any
> wise need aught at my hands.
> 
> I desire with all my heart to honor and respect my husband as my head,
> ever to live in his confidence and by acting in unison with him retain
> the place which God has given me by his side, and I ask my Heavenly
> Father that through humility, I may be enabled to overcome that curse
> which was pronounced upon the daughters of Eve. I desire to see that I
> may rejoice with them in the blessings which God has in store for all
> who are willing to be obedient to his requirements. Finally, I desire
> that whatever may be my lot through life I may be enabled to
> acknowledge the hand of God in all things.

There were too many unknowns. All Emma could do was resign herself to a
power she thought to be in control of everything. In her mind, whatever
happened in that jail would be the plan and will of god. She could only
operate with whatever information she had, which was scarce and delayed.

In Carthage, Joseph Smith woke up with John S. Fullmer’s head on his
right arm, and Dan Jones’s head on his left arm. He probably used a coat
for his own pillow on the hard, wooden floor. John Taylor, Willard
Richards, Stephen Markham and Hyrum Smith awoke from the bed as the sun
broke through the window. It was to be a very busy day. The men in the
jail briefly spoke with Double-Dub Phelps and Nauvoo’s city marshal,
John P. Greene, who’d executed the mayor’s orders to burn the Nauvoo
Expositor printing press. We don’t know what information was exchanged
as these men passed presumably from Yelrom to Nauvoo and stopped in
Carthage for a few minutes at 5 a.m.

The prisoners then took breakfast at 7 with a Mr. Crane, whose identity
is unknown. Apparently he had a question for the prophet: “Mr crane at
\[breakfast\] with us wanted to know if Joseph fainted 3 times on
tuesday rev\[ie\]wing the Troops.--currently reported--”. Did Jo faint 3
times while Governor Ford was showing him to the militias in Carthage?
Quite an odd artifact to find in White-out Willard Richards’s
contemporary journal and that’s the only place I find it mentioned.
Maybe he was intimidated, overwhelmed, underslept, overstressed, strung
out from whatever the Doctor was giving him, and underfed.

Jo had had a conversation with Governor Thomas Ford the previous day.
Ford was leaving for Nauvoo this morning and Jo would accompany him to
the Mormon stronghold so Ford could better understand the situation from
the perspective of the citizens there. When a state is teetering on the
edge of civil war, there are many angles to consider; Ford wanted to
balance what he was hearing from the anti-Mormons with some interviews
of Mormon citizens in Nauvoo. How can the executive of the State make
good decisions when he’s being fed sporadic and unverifiable information
by people who just want to kill every Mormon they see? He didn’t know
who he could trust. Governor Ford knew that whatever happened in Nauvoo
would be reflected in the other Mormon settlements nearby as the people
would follow their prophet no matter what. If Ford could get the prophet
and Mormons on his side, or even warn them of the danger they were in,
he could negotiate the tensions from a place of advantage.

One of the Mormon settlements outside Nauvoo that had come under intense
pressure was Yelrom. The morning of June 27th, 1844 for Leonora Snow was
a stressful one. Some men claiming to be operating under the color of
militia law had approached the Mormons there and given them a 24-hour
ultimatum, help us arrest your prophet or give up your guns. But, Jo had
sent a letter telling the Yelrom Mormons to keep him informed on what
was going on and that they needed to remain there as a strategic
advantage. Once the militias closed in on Nauvoo, the Mormons in Yelrom,
Ramus, Macedonia, and other satellite settlements presented the best
opportunity to provide an assault on the flanks of the besieging
Illinois armies.

All things considered, tensions were high in Yelrom and Leonora Snow,
and her husband Isaac Morley, along with the hundreds others living
there would feel these tensions the morning of June 27th when they awoke
at daybreak. Leonora didn’t know if the militia men, Mr.s Banks and
Baker, would return and force the citizens out of their homes to
consolidate the Mormons in Nauvoo. She didn’t know the whereabouts of
her sister, Eliza R. Snow, nor when her brother, Lorenzo, would return
from his mission in Ohio. Eliza R. Snow had been living with her sister,
Leonora, and brother-in-law, Isaac Morley, in Yelrom until April 1844,
when she moved in with Hannah and Stephen Markham in Nauvoo. Eliza left
her sister, Leonora, to live with Isaac and Leonora’s sister-wives
understanding Isaac was a good man who dearly cared for all his wives.
Eliza was happy to live back in Nauvoo close to her husband, Joseph.
Leonora and Eliza, the sisters Snow, were separated by the hotbeds of
anti-Mormonism, Warsaw, where Thomas Sharp’s Warsaw Signal was
published, and Carthage, where the prophet was in jail and Governor Ford
was encamped. The sisters would have had very different pressures
stemming from the same tension upon waking up. Leonora, of course, would
have wondered when the state militia would march into Yelrom and remove
the Mormons from their homes. Eliza would have wondered what would
happen once Nauvoo was surrounded by the state militia, as all signals
seemed to indicate this maneuver was imminent.

Governor Thomas Ford was well aware of this. He was hearing voices
crying from all over the state telling him to simply exterminate the
Mormons as Governor Lilburn Boggs had done in Missouri. As he organized
his posse to travel to Nauvoo on the morning of June 27th, he weighed in
the balance how effective his companies of militias would be with
guarding the jail in Carthage. He’d disbanded all the state militias,
that was over 1,300 men, which had gathered in Carthage and Warsaw with
the understanding that it would illustrate to the citizens that the
situation was under control. He resolved to take a guard with him to
Nauvoo and leave the Carthage Greys in their own city to board at their
own homes while guarding the Mormon leadership in the jail. Governor
Ford writes in retrospect in his HIstory of Illinois circa 1852.

> What gave me greater confidence in the selection of this \[Carthage\]

We’ll talk about that point in a moment because a lot of people were
warning Governor Ford that an assassination attempt was in the works,
but they were all sycophants of the Prophet who Ford generally
distrusted for good reasons to begin with. He also distrusted a lot of
the citizens who hated the Mormons. He was a smart guy and inherently
skeptical.

Ford had some leverage calculated in leaving Brigadier-general Deming in
charge of the Greys who were guarding the jail. Ford knew how high the
tensions were and that Deming had his head on straight. Any non-Mormon
militia officer who was being charged by the other men as a friend of
the Mormons was a good pick to oversee the guard operations in town. But
there was more to this calculation because if any attack happened on the
prisoners in Carthage while Governor Ford was in Nauvoo, his life would
be in danger. He feared the immediate Mormon retaliation should anything
happen to the prophet; which he considered his own life being in danger
enough insurance against any attack on the Mormon leadership in the
jail. If Jo was hurt, the Mormons would wreak vengeance on the entire
county beginning with the Governor himself. He thought that nobody would
be so cavalier and stupid as to make such an attack with so many lives
held in the balance. The prophet dying in Carthage, guarded by the
Carthage militia, would ensure the Mormon vengeance campaign would begin
with the citizens of that city; they would never be so stupid as to put
their property, lives, and families in danger by allowing harm to come
upon the prophet while in their care under Deming’s supervision.

Governor Ford had told Jo the previous day that he would accompany the
governor and his dragoons for their trip to Nauvoo. However, Ford
decided that it was an ill-advised decision as he’d be unable to ensure
the prophet’s return to Carthage as soon as he entered his kingdom and
Ford’s men became subject to the whims of the now-disbanded Nauvoo
Legion following the word of their supreme leader. Jo wrote a letter to
his wife, Emma, telling her of the situation, assuring her all was well,
and instructing her to receive the Governor and his men once Jo had been
told what was going on. Understandably, with tensions so high and a
platoon led by the Governor marching into Nauvoo would be treated with
hostility by the Mormons; Jo wanted to make sure Emma knew their arrival
was no cause for alarm. The body of the letter is written by White-out
Willard Richards, with a small post script written by the prophet
himself. It was also drafted early in the morning in preparation for
sending out with that afternoon’s mails, but it was revised as the
prisoners received more information.

When that final P.S. was added at 20 minutes to 10 a.m., a messenger
named Joel S. Miles put the letter in his pocket and set out for Nauvoo
ahead of the Governor’s posse to deliver the crucial message to Emma
before they arrived. If he was unable to reach Nauvoo before the
Governor and dragoons, who knows how the Mormon leadership there would
react to the Governor and his troops riding into the theocratic kingdom.

There’s a point worth mentioning here; Jo and the other men locked in
Carthage Jail weren’t your regular prisoners. Prisoners locked in jail
on horse theft charges, disorderly conduct or breaching the peace,
counterfeit, other lower-level crimes, would be locked in jail without
any access to people from the outside. They may be allowed to see legal
counsel or send and receive letters, but their liberty was completely
restricted. However, for high-level white collar, political, or military
crimes, those same restrictions rarely take place. Jo and his buddies
were allowed messengers by special permission from Governor Ford. These
messengers could enter and exit the jail apartments at will. The jail
itself wasn’t what we usually understand a jail to be either; the men
spent a short amount of time in an actual cell with bars on the windows
and door, but that was only for a few hours. The majority of the time
they spent was in the upstairs apartment with windows that could open
wide enough to fit a man through, and messengers could carry letters in
and out of that apartment as they pleased. The men allowed special
permissions were Stephen Markham, the same family Eliza R. Snow was
living with at the time in Nauvoo, Dan Jones, the Mississippi ferry
owner and a Danite who had lots of little birds all over the county and
funneled information to the prophet, Joel S. Miles, a Nauvoo Legionnaire
who served as a courier, John S. Fullmer, another Nauvoo Legionnaire and
personal Danite bodyguard of the prophet, Hugh T. Reid and James Woods,
non-Mormon attorneys for the prophet, and finally Cyrus Wheelock,
another messenger. As long as Governor Ford was in town, the jailor,
George Stigall would honor the passes of these men to enter and exit the
Carthage apartment jail as necessary. There was an air of gentlemanly
trust among these people that anything brought to, or removed from, the
jail wasn’t anything that would alter the circumstances. The letters
sent and received don’t seem to have been screened and the men weren’t
really searched for contraband, or if they were it wasn’t very thorough.
That’s because it wasn’t the bars on the windows or even the jailor,
George Stigall, who was keeping them there and stopping them from trying
to break out, it was the entire militia outside and the risk assessment
for attempting to escape. How would they escape? What was the plan once
they were outside the jail? What would stop the militia from shooting
them as soon as they stepped foot outside the building? Everybody valued
their own lives too much to attempt anything so stupid and nothing that
entered or left the jail was expected to change that risk assessment.

As Governor Ford was getting ready to leave for Nauvoo, John S. Fullmer
planned on taking an initial round of communications with him to Nauvoo.
According to Fullmer himself in a letter to George A. Smith while
working on the History of the Church project in 1854, Fullmer “left for
Nauvoo with instructions from Joseph and Hiram to aid in hunting up and
forwarding witnesses to Carthage.” As the men were expecting their trial
in 2 days, on June 29th, they wanted to prepare a slate of witnesses
with a solid and cohesive story to defend the prophet and get him
released on the charges of riot and treason… also to probably destroy or
move the counterfeit press that was operating in the city; although the
evidence for that is really tough to nail down. Sometime in the 3-hour
period between waking up on Jo’s right arm, and leaving around 8,
Fullmer removed a single-shot pistol from his frock and handed it to
Joseph Smith. What was the plan with this gun? He didn’t seem to provide
any extra powder or balls and the gun was good for one shot if the
powder remained dry. Would Jo fight off the entire Carthage Grey militia
with one shot from one pistol? Or maybe it was for himself should the
situation turn really sour. We can’t know; all we do know is Fullmer
passed this single-shot pistol to Joseph Smith, who accepted it and hid
it in his coat. He may have told the other prisoners about the gun, or
he may have kept it to himself. John S. Fullmer left with his
instructions to gather witnesses about an hour ahead of Governor Ford’s
posse of dragoons.

As Ford gathered his men for the trip to Nauvoo, Dan Jones, who’d woken
up on the left arm of the prophet, left the jail cell to procure a
private pass for Willard Richards and himself to come and go from
Carthage as they pleased that day. The experience of Dan Jones is quite
interesting. Jones had heard of the conspiracy afoot in Carthage to
murder the prisoners as he was headed to meet the Governor. This
exchange is reported in the History of the Church:

> While \[Dan\] Jones was going to Governor Ford’s quarters, he saw an
> assemblage of men, and heard one of them who was apparently a leader,
> making a speech, saying that “our troops will be discharged this
> morning in obedience to orders, and for a sham we will leave the town;
> but when the Governor and the McDonough troops have left for Nauvoo
> this afternoon, we will return and kill those men, if we have to tear
> the jail down.” This sentiment was applauded by three cheers from the
> crowd.
>

> His Excellency replied, “You are unnecessarily alarmed for the safety
> of your friends, sir; the people are not that cruel.”
> 
> Irritated by such a remark, Jones urged the necessity of placing

> Messrs. Smith are American citizens, and have surrendered themselves
> to your Excellency upon your pledging your honor for their safety;
> they are also Master Masons, and as such Idemand of you protection of
> their lives.”
> 
> Governor Ford’s face turned pale, and Jones remarked, “If you do not

> 
> “What is that, sir?” he asked in a hurried tone.
> 
> “It is,” said Jones, “That the Almighty will preserve my life to a

> 
> While obtaining this \[jail pass\], Jones’ life was threatened, and

> kill Joe and Hyrum, and you had better go away and save yourself.”

A few points to mention. This was written after the fact so conversation
could be fabricated or falsely remembered to tell any narrative the
historians wanted. This casts the entire account into question, but I
believe the core point is accurate, Dan Jones was one voice which warned
the Governor that there was a conspiracy to assassinate the men as soon
as he left town. Dan Jones was a pretty unremarkable dude and not
well-known outside Nauvoo; he could have eavesdropped any number of
conversations and public speeches and gathered all sorts of intel. That
was his specialty, gathering information from his little birds around
town, which made him the best ferry captain in town. He was privy to all
sorts of conversations other people weren’t and he funneled that intel
back to the prophet. However, if the conspirators were this vocal about
assassinating the prophet in the presence of Governor Ford, Ford never
would have left town. The absolute last place he would want to be when
the prophet was murdered was Nauvoo because they’d instantly retaliate.
If he really believed they’d be murdered as soon as he left, Nauvoo is
the last place he’d go. More on that in a few minutes.

Dan Jones returned to the jail with a pass for White-out Willard
Richards, but was denied his own pass. The pass for Doctor Richards read
“\[you are to\] permit Doct Richards the private secretary of Joseph
Smith to be with him if he disires it and to pass and repass the guard.”
Willard Richards wasn’t charged with the crimes, he was in Carthage with
Hyrum, Jo, and John Taylor of his own volition. He now had a pass to
enter and exit the jail freely. Dan Jones, however, would not be granted
the same access again after having spent the previous night in the jail.
He remained in Carthage to serve as another message courier.

As Jones was leaving the jail, another man entered the jail with a
private pass to see the prisoners. This man was named Cyrus Wheelock; he
stopped in to take some verbal messages from the prophet and possibly
convey verbal messages from Nauvoo to the prophet and patriarch. Cyrus
Wheelock had in his boot a small pistol as well. This pistol wasn’t a
single-shot like Fullmer had given to Joseph, this was what was known as
a pepperbox pistol. Revolvers had yet to become very popular at the time
as they were such a recent invention; what preceded the revolver were
pepperbox pistols. Notoriously unreliable and nearly impossible to aim,
these pistols have individual barrels for each shot, as opposed to a
cylinder that revolves the charges and fires each through the same
barrel. This pistol was a six-shooter, having 6 individual barrels each
loaded with a charge and cap. Each time a person pulls the trigger it
cycles each barrel, allowing the user to fire 6 individual shots. A
patent was filed in 1837 by an inventor named Ethan Allen, which kicked
off the popularity of these guns. Eventually, the Allen and Thurber
pepperbox pistol, manufactured in Connecticut, became a mainstay and
popular pistol, often selling for around $10 at the time. Allen &
Thurber never marketed to the military, these were strictly civilian
personal defense guns with no sights and smooth bore barrels. Often,
especially the early versions of pepperbox pistols, when the cap would
detonate from the hammer, the spark would jump from one barrel to
another and discharge multiple shots with one pull of the trigger with a
delay of a few milliseconds, only adding to the difficulty of aiming.
They are useless for attempting to shoot a target further than 5-feet
away, but in a crowded area or point-blank range they’re incredibly
effective; it’s what gamers and jarheads alike call spray-and-pray.
These gave shooters the ability to fire six shots instead of
single-shots like most pistols that dominated the market prior to the
late 1830s.

Cyrus Wheelock removed this pepperbox pistol from his boot and handed it
to Joseph. At this point, Jo tried to give it back to Cyrus saying he
needed it for personal protection. Wheelock declined and Jo went over to
his coat where he’d stashed the single-shot pistol given him by John S.
Fullmer. He pulled this single shot pistol out and handed it to his
brother, Hyrum sidekick-Abiff Smith, saying “You may have use for this.”
Hyrum’s reply? “I hate to use such things, or to see them used.” “So do
I,’ said Joseph, ‘but we may have to, to defend ourselves;’”. Hyrum took
the single-shot pistol from his younger brother and placed it in his
pants pocket. Jo did the same with Wheelock’s pepperbox pistol.

A little anecdote you may find amusing. The last time I visited Nauvoo,
I was lucky enough to get a tour of Carthage and Nauvoo from an
incredible researcher who tends to be very reclusive, but knows more
about Nauvoo than entire teams employed by the church. With this guide,
a number of historian friends and I attended the Carthage tour provided
by missionaries who know tell the story by what they memorized from the
church’s pamphlet. As the elderly missionary told the story, these
historians essentially used the missionary’s talking points as queues to
discuss the history behind the story the missionary told. As they
talked, the missionary became quieter and quieter, eventually realizing
there was nothing he would tell any of us that we didn’t know much more
about than him. The tour finished and we walked back down the stairs
from the upstairs apartment where the shootout occurred and into the
small courtyard beneath the window. We discussed the various accounts of
what happened after the shootout and I was vigorously taking notes as
these historians discussed the accounts and how reliable they are. Then,
the independent researcher tour guide turned to all of us and asked if
we wanted to see something special he brought along for the tour. Of
course, we replied in chorus. He reached into the pocket of his
pantaloons and removed a small pepperbox pistol. He wasn’t cosplaying, I
just like the word pantaloons. It was a very small pistol, about the
size of my hand from bottom of the handle to the end of the barrels. The
metal action and trigger guard had some small engravings that were
nearly worn down, nothing special, just some swirls and flourishes. It
didn’t have a serial number, just a couple stamps with the patent date
of 1837 and the Allen & Thurber name. It was cold and heavier than
expected for how much metal is contained in the little package. This was
an actual period gun, not a replica or something; it could be fired with
a few caps, powder, ball, and wadding. If memory serves it was a .32
caliber, the most common bore for these pistols. I held it, cycled the
action a few times without letting the hammer hit the cap nipple; I
didn’t want to damage it. Each turn of the barrels made a satisfying
little clink as the next barrel cycled to the hammer. This may sound odd
to hear, but it was oddly peaceful. To be standing in the courtyard
where Joseph Smith was assassinated, having heard the story from a
missionary and further expounded by historians who know more about the
story than any missionary who ever staffs the Carthage Jail tourist
center, and to be holding the same gun Jo probably used in that very
place, a deep sense of wonder and peace came over me. I don’t know what
it was… I couldn’t help but get lost in thought. Maybe I was pondering
the fragility of life, how such a monstrous tyrant bleeds just like you
and me, how none of us are invincible and all of our time will be up one
day. I can’t tell you what that feeling was, but it was contemplative
and peaceful to be holding that gun in that place at that time,
surrounded by those people who were so kind and generous to me as the
Mormon history apprentice of the group. Thank you, Joseph Johnstun.

Jo and Hyrum were now both armed. Hyrum could get off one shot, Jo six
if the gun functioned perfectly, maybe that would be enough to frighten
off any attempt to cause them harm. Why arm themselves? I doubt they
considered that question in the abstract. If they were to attempt an
escape, 7 balls couldn’t do anything against companies of the Carthage
Greys. Maybe it was just a matter of having the pistols in their
possession that provided a false sense of security and that reason alone
is enough. No matter what the situation, having guns only made the
situation worse for the prisoners, regardless of whether or not the guns
were used. These were real human beings, not action movie heroes or
video game characters. In no situation would those guns be helpful to
them. But, being armed while surrounded by hundreds of armed people who
want you dead can provide that sense of security which was lacking for
the men in the cell.

Soon after Cyrus Wheelock armed Joseph with the pepperbox pistol, he
left the jail cell with a message for Governor Ford, telling him not to
hold any military parade in Nauvoo upon his arrival for fear it would
excite the citizens into violence.

Before Wheelock left, Jo and Hyrum had some verbal messages for Cyrus to
carry back to Nauvoo with him.

Like any good mafia, Hyrum knew who could keep the story straight; who
was enough “in the know” to give the court the “truthful” account of
what transpired. Jo implicitly trusted him.

The man who armed the prophet with his famed pepperbox pistol departed
Carthage for Nauvoo around 11 a.m. carrying a list of witnesses for
Saturday’s trial and a litany of verbal communications which were never
recorded and will forever be lost to history.

Around 11:30 in the morning, another messenger arrived carrying a
curious letter. The messenger was Almon Babbit and the letter, which I
teased back on episode 211. I said “we must wait before we’re able to
discuss \[this\] message specifically” because it’s a passage from
White-out Willard’s journal of the day that I’m still trying to figure
out. Here’s the passage: “11-30 Almon Babbit arrivd read a letter from O
Cowdery.” And that’s it. Oliver Cowdery, Cowdung Allover, has been
almost completely absent from our timeline since he was excommunicated
in early 1838 and here, on the day of the prophet’s death, Cowdery sent
a letter to Jo and friends. The last time Ollie had shared
correspondence with the Nauvoo leadership was back in December 1843. Jo
told White-out Willard to “Write to Oliver Cowdery ask him if he has eat
husks long enough. if he is not most ready to return & be clothed in
robes of righteousness & go up to Jerusalem. Orson Hyde need of him…”.
Jo wanted Ollie back in the fold and the way he did it was degrading;
Hey Ollie, you sick of eating like a pig yet? You ready to come back to
where you belong? But there could be more to it, as Jo had married
Orson’s wife, Marinda Nancy Johnson Hyde, while Orson was on a
mission. Maybe Ollie’s wife, Elizabeth Ann Whitmer, sister of Peter,
David, and John Whitmer, was Jo’s next possible target.

The letter Richards wrote with the help of Bloody Brigham is less
condescending than Jo put it, but still quite fascinating.

That letter was written on April 19, 1843, but wasn’t sent until
December 10th for unknown reasons. Here’s Ollie’s reply a few days after
receiving the letter:

Oliver Cowdery, from being Jo’s scribe for the Book of Mormon, to
becoming the second elder of the church, to running the stake in Zion
and being chased out of Jackson County, Missouri by mobs, to settling
Far West with the first faction of saints to resettle there from
Independence, to attending the Kirtland Temple dedication ceremony, to
charging the prophet with having a “dirty, nasty, filthy affair” with
Fanny Alger, to being excommunicated from the church and targeted by
Jo’s shadow hit squad, the Danites, by name in the Danite Manifesto,
which gave him 48 hours to leave Far West or “vengeance… will overtake
you at an hour when you do not expect, and at a day when you do not look
for it; and for you there shall be no escape; for there is but one
decree for you, which is depart, depart, or a more fatal calamity shall
befall you.” Ollie complied with the Danite manifesto and remained in
Missouri for a brief time, “a stranger in a strange land,” while the
Mormons were forcibly removed from the state and resettled in Illinois,
eventually building Nauvoo, Jo’s theocracy. During that interim period
of 1839-43, when this letter was sent, Cowdery moved back to Ohio where
he practiced law and politics. Now, in December 1843, his letter
articulated his problems with the church, that the leaders were all
good, but that there were some “ambitious and wicked men… hoping to get
some other men’s birth right” who “caused all this difficulty from
beginning to end.” It was those evil and designing men who “succeeded in
getting myself out of the Church”. It’s hard to know who he’s alluding
to, possibly Doctor Sampson Avard or Thomas B. Marsh, maybe it was the
Whitmer brothers, Peter, David, and John, maybe it was Hingepin Sidney
Rigdon. We don’t know who he’s talking about here. But, because “they
themselves have gone to perdition” he believes “old friends… to be
friends still”. He also concluded with a post-script that this letter
should never be exhibited publicly, a burn notice basically, which is
quite remarkable. The great saga of Oliver Cowdery seems to conclude
with him wanting to come back to the church in Nauvoo and set aside “any
and all religious consideration” which may have caused the trouble with
those in perdition who succeeded in removing him from the church. But,
and this is important, Ollie didn’t come back. He never made the trip to
Nauvoo to officially be refellowshipped into Jo’s church. Now, on this
day, June 27th, 1844, with Jo and Hyrum facing death before nightfall,
Oliver Cowdery sent one final letter to the prophet which was read to
him just six hours before dying. This final communication between Oliver
Cowdery and Joseph Smith said: “....” I don’t know. The letter was never
recorded anywhere and it’s never been located. The final data point in
the story of Oliver Cowdery is nothing more than a question mark. Was he
trying to coordinate his return? Was he castigating the leadership for
their overtly treasonous activities? Was he asking for details about
joining Orson Hyde on another journey to Jerusalem and asking about the
safety of his wife, Elizabeth, should he choose to go? Was he relaying
information about the church in Kirtland, just a few days’ journey from
where he lived in Tiffin? Simply put, we’ll probably never know because
the letter is lost to history.

As the day wore into afternoon, Governor Ford left for Nauvoo after
disbanding the militias there and leaving a small cohort of Carthage
Greys to guard the jail. The journey to Nauvoo was about 4 hours on
horseback. One of his advisors voiced what they were all thinking during
the trip to Nauvoo.

> Having ordered the guard, and left General Deming in command in

Colonel Buckmaster, as a personal assistant to Governor Ford, had his
eyes peeled for any activity like this. They’d obviously heard a lot of
rumblings about taking vigilante justice on the prisoners which is
precisely why Governor Ford disbanded the militias to begin with, but
this presented a dangerous situation because the foxes were guarding the
hen house and daddy was no longer in town to keep the situation under
control. Ford, however, viewed the situation differently, but still took
the advice of Colonel Buckmaster very seriously. He also had the voices
of Stephen Markham, Dan Jones, Cyrus Wheelock, and other Mormon men
echoing through his mind that there was a conspiracy waiting for him to
leave Carthage so they could make the attack.

It may have appeared a reasonable supposition, but it’s clear that Ford
harbored some apprehensions about the safety of the prisoners. He
decided to make his visit to Nauvoo shorter than 2 days as originally
planned and determined to simply make a public speech to the Mormons
about what was going on, and resolve to search for the counterfeit
machine at a later time when tensions weren’t so high.

Ford had ambitious plans upon his arrival to Nauvoo. Originally he’d
planned to find the counterfeit machine, investigate the charges of
polygamy and sex-trafficking, interview folks about the night the
Expositor press was destroyed to find out what actually happened and how
big the riot was, release any prisoners still in the city jail from that
night or who’d been committed to the city jail when the city was under
martial law, and generally figure out the sentiment of the Mormons
against their non-Mormon neighbors. These plans, however, would have to
be put on hold until a later time because Ford also believed an attack
on the jail to be possible and imminent. He needed to be in two places
at once to keep the peace. Luckily for him, messengers had already
arrived in Nauvoo to make sure the Legion didn’t muster or show any
aggression whatsoever to Ford’s posse upon their arrival.

While this was transpiring, a militia force from Warsaw, the twin-city
to Carthage of the anti-Mormon political party, was marching toward
Nauvoo to join Governor Ford’s McDonough posse. They’d yet to receive
Governor Ford’s orders to disband and were making their way to Carthage
to join forces with the Carthage Greys in defence of the city should the
Mormons march to Carthage and attempt to remove their supreme leader by
force. The journey from Warsaw to Carthage is just over 20 miles,
slightly less than one day’s journey on horseback. They’d left Warsaw
early that morning and when they reached about the halfway point between
Warsaw and Carthage, a messenger approached them and conveyed Governor
Ford’s orders to disband. However, this messenger also told them that
Governor Ford was not at Carthage, but in Nauvoo. This Warsaw contingent
was led by a man named Colonel Levi Williams. Williams has made a few
appearances in our timeline, mostly connected with the horse-thief
Daniel Avery when he was arrested and taken across the Mississippi into
Missouri to answer old charges from the Missouri-Mormon war. Levi
Williams is a prominent figure in the anti-Mormon movement. He was good
friends with his neighbor, Thomas Sharp, who’s paper, the Warsaw Signal,
was the chief paper of anti-Mormonism. Levi Williams and Thomas Sharp
were two founding members of the anti-Mormon political party. He was a
vocal critic who wanted to murder the prophet and any other Mormon who
came across his path, but civil law kept him from being able to act out
his violent fantasies. Governor Ford even provides some insight into
Colonel Levi Williams and his role this day of June 27th.

Whether Levi Williams made such a speech is still unknown, but he had
enough people looking to him to orchestrate the events of that night. In
a reminiscince from 1908, a Mormon named Matthew Caldwell spoke of this
speech, likely passed to him through oral tradition.

Levi Williams and his band were actually headed to Nauvoo with the
intent of burning it to the ground and exterminating the citizens.
However, because information traveled slowly, they didn’t receive the
orders to disband until they were already half-way through their journey
to Nauvoo.

When this messenger told Colonel Levi Williams and his men that Ford had
ordered the militias to disband, but was at the time in Nauvoo, Williams
got an exciting idea. Most of his men turned around and went back home
to Warsaw. Levi Williams, however, took his volunteer vigilante militia
and continued their journey to Carthage, instead of Nauvoo, for the
remainder of the morning into the afternoon.

A man named John Hay wrote about his eyewitness experience at this time
while he was in Carthage in 1869, which I find more reliable than that
previous quote of oral tradition recorded in 1908 by a Mormon who wasn’t
even alive when it happened.

This same John Hay offers some interesting insight into the mindset of

With the dehumanization total and complete, assassinating the Smiths
that day was merely pest removal, the way we’d exterminate a rat
infestation. People who were otherwise good and honest people,
completely succumbed to base instincts and tribalism. Levi Williams made
the decision to take his small group of men into Carthage via a
circuitous route to appear to be coming from Nauvoo, and the plans were
formed and put into play. Continuing in Governor Ford’s account:

> A communication was soon established between the conspirators and the
> company; and it was arranged that the guard should have their guns
> charged with blank cartridges, and fire at the assailants when they
> attempted to enter the jail.

According to plan, when the time was right, Levi Williams’s men would be
the attacking militia in a conspiracy with the company of Carthage Greys
stationed to guard the jail. When the men from Williams’s mob attacked,
the Greys would fire blank rounds at them as if they were attempting to
defend the prisoners, thus providing a shield of plausible deniability.
The plan was put in place; all Colonel Williams needed was for the
change in guard that evening to get his co-conspirators to be the actual
jail guards. Once Colonel Deming, who Ford put in place to oversee the
prison watch duties, realized a mutiny was afoot, he’d quickly flee
because his men were no longer loyal to Governor Ford and himself. The
conspirator who was guarding the jail at the time was a man named Frank
Worrel; he would aid the mob in getting into the jail after their
feigned an attack on him and his men. The plan was put into motion, the
wheels of vigilante justice were rolling, and Colonel Levi Williams,
would arrive in Carthage with his mutinous gang close to 5 that evening.

A point I want to discuss emerges from those previous accounts, and that
is ThomASS Sharp, the editor of the Warsaw Signal. He’s centered in our
Nauvoo timeline as the most prominent and vocal critic of the Mormon
empire and the prophet himself. I’ve looked for a long time to determine
whether or not Thomas Sharp was part of Levi Williams’s mob that
assaulted the jail. Unfortunately there isn’t a solid answer here. He
was obviously guilty of stoking the flames that led to this event by
calling for extermination of the Mormons following the destruction of
the Expositor press. Hyrum Smith even threatened to burn down the Warsaw
Signal, Sharp’s paper, for what Sharp was printing in the furor burning
through the area. Levi Williams and Thomas Sharp were friends and
neighbors in Warsaw, but Sharp wasn’t an officer in the Warsaw militia,
so he had no reason to be marching with Williams’s boys to begin with,
unless storming the jail was premeditated the previous evening as that
1908 account claimed. A few later accounts place Thomas Sharp in
Carthage that night and he eventually stood trial for the murders, but
another account that’s earlier than the accounts which put him there
states explicitly “I was pushed and shoved some fifty feet..... Did not
see Sharp, Grover, or Davis.” However, just because he didn’t see Sharp
in the crowd doesn’t mean Thomas Sharp wasn’t there. It’s one of those
data points that remains a mystery and the data point is actually pretty
consequential. His account of the jail storm is an oddly accurate report
of the events and it was published immediately after the deaths, as in
just a few hours after they occurred. Which means he himself
participated and immediately fled the 18 miles to Warsaw and began
writing and printing the paper for that night, which would be quite a
feat with slim margins of time. Or, he remained in Warsaw and as soon as
the first participant of the mob arrived back in Warsaw and conveyed the
account to Sharp he started printing the extra. I will point out, in his
account, Sharp claims a Mormon attempted to rush the jail to break out
the prisoners as the inciting incident, but there’s no evidence for this
and all evidence indicates the contrary. It was characteristic, however,
of Sharp to accuse the Mormons as the aggressors in any conflict he
reported in the Warsaw Signal. Sharp’s article, however, prints
information unknown to any Carthaginians that he must have received by
express messenger reporting the movement of Governor Ford in Nauvoo.
Sharp also messes up the sequence of events by a few hours here and
there, which leads me to believe he wasn’t in Carthage, but reporting on
intel messengers and reporters were bringing to him in Warsaw while
preparing his extra for that evening. He also falsely says the Richards
almost died from it, when it was actually John Taylor who nearly died;
Richards got a scratch on the ear. His article reads to me like he was
reporting events from what people told him, not from a first-person
witness account. Simply put, Thomas Sharp may have been part of the mob
that night, but he also might not have been. His account reads
second-hand and contains numerous inaccuracies and the accounts which
place him there are almost all late, second or third hand, and almost
exclusively provided by Mormons who viewed Sharp as their public enemy
\#1. History often leaves us with ambiguities like this. So, whenever
I’m talking about Levi Williams and his boys storming the jail, just
know that ThomASS Sharp may have been part of the crowd, but he also may
not have been.

As Levi Williams’s troops shifted their destination from Nauvoo to
Carthage, the prisoners took lunch at 1:15. Jo, Hyrum, and White-out
Willard ate lunch in the upper apartment while Stephen Markham and John
Taylor ate their lunch in the lower apartment adjacent to the kitchen.
It was generally agreed that the second story was safer than the ground
floor of the jail as assailants would have a much harder time firing
into a window of the second story as opposed to just firing straight
into the window like Pistol Packin’ Porter did to Governor Lilburn
Boggs. After dinner, Stephen Markham left the jail to acquire a pipe and
some smoking tobacco and bring it back to the prisoners to enjoy after
their meal. At this time, Dan Jones was about to depart Carthage to
carry a letter to Orville Browning in Quincy. Browning had served as
Jo’s legal counsel back in 1841 when he was arrested by constables on
order from Missouri. Jo wanted to retain Orville Browning to help in the
coming trial on June 29th. Dan Jones tells of his experience in Carthage
acting as courier in an incredibly hostile environment.

He’s right. If Dan Jones had continued down that same road towards
Warsaw, within an hour he would have run into Levi Williams and his
rogue militia on the warpath toward Carthage. Luckily he recognized the
error of his ways and diverted his path north toward Nauvoo, passing
Governor Ford on the way.

Dan Jones and Governor Ford continued their respective journeys toward
Nauvoo, though with vastly different missions. Notably, gunshots weren’t
reported by Willard Richards or anybody else upon the departure of Dan
Jones. That means they probably didn’t shoot at him while he rode out of
town; those are just fun details he added to make himself more of a hero
in the midst of a circumstance where there were no heroes.

Events in Carthage began to signal that all was not well and the
warnings Dan Jones gave to White-out Willard were justified. There were
8 men guarding the jail specifically and about 60 Carthage Greys were
stationed as guards throughout the town, cycling who was on active guard
duty at the jail itself. White-out Willard recorded in his journal that
tensions were beginning to excite.

As the militia became more excited and combative in Carthage, Governor
Ford arrived in Nauvoo. His arrival was preceded by the letter from Jo
to Emma and other communications to church and city leaders to not make
any show of force or demonstration that would seem threatening to the
Governor. Everybody recognized this as their opportunity to gain Ford’s
favor in the conflict and they were all on their best behavior. Ford
first went to the Nauvoo Mansion and held a meeting with his advisors
and some men of the Nauvoo government. An occurrence happened here
before Ford gave his speech and the details of it are tough to deal
with. Pistol Packin’ Porter gave an affidavit in April 1856 in Utah that
paints a disturbing and ominous picture of the situation and I need to
give voice to this perspective. Porter had attended a meeting earlier in
the day in the same room Governor Ford held this meeting. But, he forgot
his hat. He returned to the room to retrieve the hat, and here’s what he
reports happened 12 years after the fact when Governor Ford was seen as
responsible for the deaths that happened that evening.

> ORRIN P. ROCKWELL

Like I said earlier, this affidavit was given 12 years after the
incident during the early Mormon reformation era which was marked by
militant anti-government culture by the Utah church. Almost immediately
after the events of Carthage, Governor Ford was blamed by the Mormons
for the assassinations; that rhetoric continued for over a decade and
Porter Rockwell, a murderer at heart and Jo’s personal destroying angel,
man of god son of thunder, put on record that he witnessed this
conversation happen. His affidavit and dozens of speeches given by
church leaders have played into the narrative that Ford orchestrated the
assassinations and left Carthage for Nauvoo that day for that very
purpose. According to this narrative, Governor Ford had a secret
alliance with Colonel Levi Williams, Thomas Sharp, and the Carthage
Greys to attack while he was in Nauvoo, and then he’d leave Nauvoo
before a messenger could arrive to tell the Mormons what had happened,
thus eliminating their ability to retaliate while he was there. My
response to that argument, it’s plausible but there’s really no
contemporary evidence of it. What evidence do we have to contradict this
conspiracy narrative? Ford’s own words and actions, but to the person
making the argument they aren’t inclined to believe Ford to begin with
so why does it matter?

We can look at it a few different ways. Ford was absolutely fed up with
the Mormons and the general lawlessness of the Mormon leadership. It may
be the case that the only way he saw to keep from his state devolving
into civil war was for the chief aggressor to simply not exist anymore.
To counter that idea though, with how high tensions were between the
Mormons in Nauvoo and the anti-Mormons in Carthage and Warsaw, the death
of Joseph Smith almost ensured civil war would break out with
retribution being the final catalyst. Joseph Smith being assassinated
wouldn’t calm tensions, it would only escalate them. If Ford had
orchestrated the death of Jo during his absence, the last place he would
want to be was Nauvoo. He stated for himself that he thought the
vigilantes wouldn’t attack while he was in Nauvoo as it would surely
result in the Mormons killing him, which he thought was enough insurance
to make the trip to begin with. However, we can also conclude that he
disbanded the various militias to make a vigilante attack safer for the
vigilantes. He would want the militias to be disbanded as it would be
less likely that the remaining people in town would uphold the law over
upholding the designs of the vigilantes. That argument can also be
flipped on its head; if Ford believed an assassination was more likely
with more men in Carthage, disbanding the militias was the smartest
thing he could have done.

The way I see it, there is no bedrock on whether or not Ford conspired
to have Jo assassinated and reasonable people can disagree about to what
extent Ford bears the blame for the deaths. What can’t be disputed,
however, is that Joseph Smith himself was responsible for his own death.
Sure, he didn’t call together the militia and tell them to assassinate
him, but he inflamed the non-Mormons around Nauvoo for over half a
decade and brought an entire state to the precipice of civil war. If not
in Carthage, Jo would have been assassinated at some point because he’d
so thoroughly demonstrated his ability to flaunt the law to the point
that only vigilante law could hold him accountable. So many times in his
life, he escaped death by the edge of unlikely circumstances and
high-profile lawyers helping him evade the law; his luck would run out
eventually. If not in Carthage than somewhere else down the line.

Regardless of responsibility, when Governor Ford made his way into
Nauvoo and held this little meeting Porter apparently barged in on to
grab his hat, thousands of Mormons came out to attend his public speech
and he mustered the disbanded Nauvoo Legion. He remembers a few details
of his speech in his History of Illinois. It’s also reported in the
History of the Church in much briefer form, so let’s start there and
then see what Ford himself remembered of the speech.

> … the Governor was making to the Saints in Nauvoo, one of the most
> infamous and insulting speeches that ever fell from the lips of an
> executive; among other things he said, “a great crime has been done by
> destroying the *Expositor* press and placing the city under martial

> responsible.

This was viewed as unfair treatment, persecution, and downright
prejudice by the Governor, but I fail to see any point in it where he’s
actually wrong. Yes, a great crime was committed by destroying the
Nauvoo Expositor, yes somebody had to pay the legal price for it, yes
the non-Mormon neighbors of the Mormons were incredibly intimidated by
the Mormons having so many guns and a militia larger than any other
state in the country, yes the Mormons had used their guns and militia
against the government before so the people nearby were afraid what
happened in Missouri would happen in Illinois, yes they ought to be
praying saints instead of military saints because that would be much
less intimidating and probably would cause the non-Mormon neighbors to
be more friendly, yes a little more misbehavior from the Mormons would
absolutely result in civil war and the government and vigilante militias
would eventually overwhelm the Mormon forces and burn Nauvoo to ashes
and another extermination order would quickly follow, yes if anything
bad happened to anybody who was trying to hold the leadership legally
accountable then the Mormons would be blamed. Taken in the context of
everything which transpired, this account of his speech doesn’t reveal
to me anything where Governor Ford was mistaken. He knew the situation
and he knew who the aggressors were. He knew about all the prejudice in
the neighboring cities and he also understood from where that prejudice
sprang. Believe it or not, the people of the day didn’t hate the Mormons
because they worshipped a false god, it’s because they were a criminal
empire with a supreme leader who flaunted the laws. Ford’s speech is
reported in such a way as to prejudice the reader against any government
official which is far more troubling to me than anything Ford actually
said. So let’s read what he remembered of his speech.

> Having made these arrangements we proceeded on our march and arrived
> at Nauvoo about four o’clock of the afternoon of the 27th day of June.
> As soon as notice could be given, a crowd of citizens assembled to
> hear an address which I proposed to deliver to them. The number
> present has been variously estimated from one to five thousand.
> 
> In this address I stated to them how, and in what, their functionaries
> had violated the laws. Also, the many scandalous reports in
> circulation against them, and that these reports, whether true or
> false, were generally believed by the people. I distinctly stated to
> them the amount of hatred and prejudice which prevailed everywhere
> against them, and the causes of it, at length.
> 
> I also told them plainly and emphatically, that if any vengeance
> should be attempted openly or secretly against the persons or property
> of the citizens who had taken part against their leaders, that the
> public hatred and excitement was such, that thousands would assemble
> for the total destruction of their city and the extermination of their
> people; and that no power in the State would be able to prevent it.

Thanks to the preaching of Jo and other church leaders, the Mormons
viewed themselves as persecuted and unfairly treated by the system of
law. Jo had so successfully poisoned the well that even the Governor of
Illinois paying the Mormons a personal visit to tell them what’s going
on was treated with hostility and viewed as further evidence of the
persecution complex.

> During this address some impatience and resentment were manifested by
> the Mormons, at the recital of the various reports enumerated
> concerning them; which they strenuously and indignantly denied to be
> true. They claimed to be a law-abiding people, and insisted that as
> they looked to the law alone for their protection, so were they
> careful themselves to observe its provisions. Upon the conclusion of
> this address, I proposed to take a vote on the question, whether they
> would strictly observe the laws, even in opposition to their prophet
> and leaders. The vote was unanimous in favor of this proposition.

Ford was able to calm the tensions and get the people to vote to uphold
the laws, even if the verdict reached was against their supreme leader.
However, Ford has some other thoughts about the visit.

> The anti-Mormons contended that such a vote from the Mormons signified
> nothing; and truly the subsequent history of that people showed
> clearly that they were loudest in their professions of attachment to
> the law whenever they were guilty of the greatest extravagances; and
> in fact, that they were so ignorant and stupid about matters of law,
> that they had no means of judging the legality of their conduct, only
> as they were instructed by their spiritual leaders.

Jo so deeply and thoroughly controlled the Mormons’ view of reality that
they trusted him to a fault. They trusted him to the point that
committing treason against the country was viewed by them as religious
discrimination. Anybody with as much power as Joseph Smith inevitably
creates situations like this where laws are seen as the infractions
against liberty, media is the enemy of the people, and any investigation
into the conduct of a demagogue like Jo is just a witch-hunt conducted
by unprincipled people with an agenda. It’s like, if you didn’t break
laws then there wouldn’t be any investigations, Jo.

Ford gave this speech then took supper at the Nauvoo Mansion, where Emma
prepared a meal for the men and the other patrons staying that night at
the Mansion. As they were taking supper in Nauvoo, they likely chatted
with Emma for some time. No record of any conversation they may have
shared survives today. I find it likely that Emma and Ford were on
first-name basis as Emma had been with the previous Governor Carlin, but
the extent of their acquaintanceship prior to this meal is unknown.

Ford remained in Nauvoo for the space of about 3 hours, having arrived
between 3 and 4, and departing around 6 or 7 that evening as the sun
sank lower into the hot and muggy June night. Meanwhile, Colonel Levi
Williams’s men were approaching ever-nearer to Carthage, having made an
alliance with the small contingent of Carthage Greys who remained on
guard. Brigadier-General Deming was stationed in or near the Carthage
jail to oversee the guards and supervise the change of guards cycling
out every 4-6 hours throughout the day. Franklin Worrel was the primary
guard on duty for the last cycle of duty that day. George Stigall, the
jailor, was engaging in conversation with the prisoners throughout the
day, he didn’t seem to hold much personal animus against the prisoners
in spite of being a Carthage resident. Jo chatted with Stigall about the
dissenters who printed the Expositor, William and Wilson Law, as well as
Joseph H. Jackson who Jo thought was responsible for so many of his
problems.

The men thought it weird. Stephen Markham had left the jail over an hour
ago to fetch a pipe and smoking tobacco but had yet to return. George
Stigall told Jo what happened. Markham had acquired the pipe and
tobacco, but as he was returning to the jail he was surrounded by a
small group of Carthage Greys and chased out of town. By this point in
the afternoon, the number of Jo loyalists in town was dwindling; Cyrus
Wheelock was out of town, Dan Jones had just been chased out and was
headed to Nauvoo after refusing to give up the letter he was taking to
Orville Browning, John S. Fullmer left for Nauvoo that morning carrying
verbal messages to the leadership prior to Governor Ford’s arrival, Joel
S. Miles also left that morning with the letter to Emma. Stephen Markham
was the last Jo loyalist in Carthage and the Greys wanted to rectify
that problem. According to Markham, “a man by the Name of Stewart”
approached him and told him to leave town, stating he had 5 minutes to
comply with the order. Markham refused to comply and attempted to make
his way toward the jail, at which point this Stewart guy charged Markham
with his bayonet. A scuffle ensued and a group of Greys rallied behind
their friend and surrounded Stephen Markham, Piggy-bank Steve, with
their bayonet-equipped rifles. They told Markham that if he didn’t leave
town they’d kill him on the spot. They got Markham’s horse and forced
him out of town at gunpoint.

The jailor, George Stigall, conveyed this information to Jo. Now, the
only Jo loyalists in Carthage were Hyrum Sidekick-Abiff Smith, White-out
Willard Richards, John Taylor, and Jo himself. All these men were in the
jail itself and only White-out Willard had a pass to come and go as he
pleased. The walls of the jail were already suffocating, but the walls
of the village of Carthage were closing in on the prophet.

They could all sense that the situation wasn’t right. It was getting
more tense in town. The guards who changed over at 4 were more
confrontational and seemed hostile. Governor Ford wasn’t expected to
return until the next day and they knew if he was in town they were
safe, but right now he was 18 miles away; his promises of safety were
now just hollow words. The men attempted to pass the time and comfort
each other. The jailor, George Stigall could sense that something was
wrong as well. He suggested they stay the night in the jail of the upper
floor, which had a locking gate on the door. “Suggested that th\[e\]y
would be safer in the jail”. Jo didn’t like jail cells and he’d been in
them on previous occasions, but he agreed with Stigall, “Joseph said
after supper we will go in”. The door to the jail also had a functioning
latch. The upper story apartment was broken and Fullmer and Markham had
fiddled with the latch with their penknife to make it work, but they
weren’t very successful and the latch didn’t work very well.

As the reality of the situation set in, Jo turned to White-out Willard
Richards and asked him a hard question.

> If we go in the jail will you go in with us.-- Dr answe\[re\]d Bro
> Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask
> me to come to ca\[r\]thage.--you did not ask me to come to Jail with
> you--and do you think I would forsake you now.--But I will tell you
> what I will do--if you are condemned to be hung for treason I will be
> hung. In your stead & you shall go freee. Joseph \[“\]you
> cannot\[“\].-- Dr said \[“\]I will\[“\].

Remember, White-out Willard wasn’t charged with any crimes and had a
pass to leave the jail at any time, which would render the same
treatment as Stephen Markham and Dan Jones of being chased out of town
at gunpoint, but at least he’d be able to make it back to Nauvoo. It was
his decision to be in the jail that evening as the situation became more
intense all around them. White-out Willard was nothing if not loyal to
his superiors; whether that be Jo or his cousin, Bloody Brigham Young as
his counselor in the nation of Deseret.

The 4 men were powerless to change their circumstances. All they could
do was pass the time and hope they’d be safe. After supper, instead of
going to the jail, they remained in the upper apartment of the jail,
protected only by a thin wooden door with a broken latch. Hyrum picked
up his 1830 copy of The Works of Flavius Josephus and read from it for a
while.

Some have claimed that Hyrum also thumbed through the Book of Mormon at
this time and read some passages, possibly even doggy-earing one page.
That’s not true, at least there’s no contemporary record of him reading
anything this day other than Josephus.

To help pass the time and comfort the mens’ nerves, John Taylor sang a
hymn derived from an 1826 poem titled “The Stranger and His Friend”.
He’d learned it while on his mission in England back in 1841 and it’s
since been adapted by Protestant churches as a hymn titled “A Poor
Wayfaring Man of Grief.”

After John Taylor concluded singing, it left the men contemplative and
at peace. Hyrum requested he sing it again, to which Taylor complied.
The jailor’s son brought some water to the men, and they requested to
see the jailor himself, George Stigall. As Stephen Markham had been
chased out of Carthage before he could deliver the pipe and smoking
tobacco, they were still wanting to satisfy their palettes. Jo asked
Stigall if he could bring them “a bottle of wine. pipe & 2 small papers
off tobacco”. Jo gave Stigall 2 and a half dollars, but Stigall refused
and said a dollar was enough. He returned in a few moments with the
materials that would get all 4 men excommunicated from the church today
and they partook to help calm their nerves. The guard had changed over;
Franklin Worrel was the guard on duty with a devious plan conceived by
him and Colonel Levi Williams. White-out Willard Richards scratched his
final entry in his journal for that day “4. o clock changed guard.--
4.15--”.

Governor Ford was having a friendly chat with Emma as she fed him supper
while 4 months pregnant with little David Hyrum Smith; the rest of the
Smith children, Julia, Joseph III, Frederick, and Alexander, scampered
about the house, not knowing why everybody was so anxious and an odd
feeling pervaded the Mormon community. They only knew daddy and uncle
Hyrum were gone and mom and Aunt Mary were more stressed than usual with
all these strange men visiting the house. Eliza Snow sat anxiously in
the Stephen Markham home as Stephen returned home, having left his
walking cane behind in his haste to flee Carthage at gunpoint;
Piggy-bank Steve undoubtedly regaled Eliza with what happened in
Carthage that morning. Leonora Snow took supper with her husband Isaac
Morley and sister-wife, Lucy, in the little Mormon settlement of Yelrom
south of Carthage; they hadn’t received word for quite some time about
what was going on in Nauvoo or nearby Carthage and they couldn’t rely on
any information they did get as it had to pass through Carthage before
reaching Yelrom. Maybe they’d be forced to give up their guns and flee
to the motherland of Nauvoo before all this was over, maybe they’d be
allowed to exist happily in their communistic village. Brigadier-General
Deming, who was loyal to Governor Ford and tasked with overseeing the
guard duties of the jail, could sense a mutiny was afoot as the newest
guards under Frank Worrel were confrontational and more abusive to the
prisoners than the previous; Deming went on high-alert. As all these
people took their supper, Colonel Levi Williams with his best friend,
ThomASS Sharp, and his troops of roughly 150 men could see Carthage on
the horizon as the sun lazily sunk to their right, casting long shadows
to the left of the riders on their southward journey. The plan was in
place, the actors in their places on stage for the jail attack to be a
success.

Jo’s closest confidants, the Quorum of Apostles, were scattered all over
the nation preaching and holding important meetings for Jo’s
presidential campaign. Amasa Lyman was in Cincinnati, George A. Smith,
who we have to thank for the History of the Church, was in Jacksonburg,
Michigan, John E. Page was in Pittsburgh working on publishing a
propaganda pamphlet and he’d soon be joined by Hingepin Rigdon who was
passing on a steamer through St. Louis on his way to Pittsburgh to
electioneer as well. Rigdon got out before the real heat turned up, just
a couple days before Jo and Hyrum surrendered. Rigdon’s leadership was
the contingency plan if everything went south for Jo and Hyrum. Orson
Hyde was in D.C. holding high-level meetings with fellow Masons trying
to sell Jo as a viable POTUS candidate, Jo’s brother Crazy Willey Smith
was somewhere in the east, possibly Boston or New York City, Heber the
Creeper Kimball was hanging out with Lyman Wight, the Wild Ram of the
Mountain, in Philadelphia heading to a conference that would be held in
Boston, presided over by Bloody Brigham and Willey Goat Wilford Woodruff
who were already there preparing for the conference. Of all these church
leaders, only Rigdon had the latest intel and had any idea of what was
going on in Nauvoo; the others weren’t even aware the Nauvoo Expositor
had been published, much less that the press was destroyed, Nauvoo had
been placed under martial law and the Legion was disbanded, and Jo and
Hyrum were in jail while Governor Ford was there handling matters
personally.

Oh Joseph and Hyrum, I regret to tell you, your die is cast, your doom
is fixed, you are sentenced to be shot. This is the moment we’ve all
been waiting for.

Hey patrons. We haven’t talked for a while. You’ve been with me for this
entire journey. I wanted to show my gratitude with something special
today. Next week we begin the end of an era for this podcast. After
that, I’m going away for a while because I owe y’all a book or two and
your old researcher, producer, host, editor, and marketer needs a break
for a bit. But, I’ve got a few plans to finish out this series and what
lies ahead so be sure to keep email notifications for this podcast
active so you can keep up with what’s going on during the coming hiatus.
For today, I wanted to give y’all a little something special. It’s
something I’ve never done on the podcast and it’s certainly not going to
be everybody’s cup of tea, but I hope you’ll briefly indulge me. Before
that, a little story.

When you go through the Carthage jail tour, the guide takes you through
each room of the jail. You start in the kitchen and then check out the
downstairs apartment and jail cells. Then you go up the stairs and see
the jail cells up there, after which the guide takes you into the
debtors apartment where the gunfight happened. Of course, the guide is
telling you the white-washed story each step of the way. When you’re in
this historic room, it’s filled with benches for tourist seating. You
take a seat and the tour guide continues to tell the story, after which
they play a tape. The audio is basically John Taylor’s recounting of the
assassination with a few liberties and some foley work of the angry mob
and gunshots, stuff like that. However, for a portion of the tape, the
narrator hands it off to another vocalist who sings A Poor Wayfaring Man
of Grief acapella. It’s a pretty weird experience if you’re not there to
build your testimony. After the tape plays the missionary bears their
testimony and the tour is completed, leaving everybody to depart in
either an awkward or a ponderous state of mind.

I had a similar experience at the Independence, Missouri visitor’s
center. My tour guides were two sister missionaries who concluded the
our tour by calling over two other sisters who then sang a song acapella
to the tour group. It probably would have been much less weird if that
tour group consisted of more people than just me. But, they were
prepared for the expected outcome because before they sang to me they
made it a point to ostentatiously hand me a box of tissues.

I’ve read poetry on the show before because I believe music and poetry
are capable of conveying a message narration simply can’t. So, if this
isn’t too weird, I give you, A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief… The Bryce
Blankenagel rendition.

A poor wayfaring Man of grief

Who answered the call to endless sleep

He sued so often for deceit

That I could never wash his feet

I have not pow’r to call him good

For theft, deception, nor shining wood

Yet there’s a story compelling me

To study and learn, for why; conceit.

Once magic and theft and polygamy

Stole my sleep and filled my feed

Twice reinvented in search of me

And wanting, hoping to be freed

Thrice broken, lost, flesh from the bone

I find myself wand’ring new, alone.

And now acacia holds the key

No longer I see hypocrisy

Egypt, Eleusis, Greek Pantheon

Each carry a part but grasp for straws

Atilla, Muhamed, Napoleon

Culling vermin; shock and awe

But to break the cycle is my plea

Never enough but always too late

To murder a tyrant is the game

And fracture undue felonious fame

Thank you, patrons.
