> Early the next morning Orrin P. Rockwell woke him up with the stunning
> news that Joseph and Hyrum had been shot to death. His diary entry for
> that day is one of the longest he ever wrote, and it contains within
> it all the sorrow, solemnity, and dismay that any disciple could feel.
> “I went out & met brother Cutler & several others,” he wrote, “and the
> news soon became general. Sorrow & gloom was pictured in every
> countenance and one universal scene of lamentation pervaded the city.
> The agony of the widows & orphan children \[i.e., the wives and
> children of Joseph and Hyrum\] was inexpressible and utterly beyond
> description.” He went on with a lengthy description of what had
> happened at Carthage, as he understood it (which turned out to be a
> fairly accurate account), emphasizing what he considered to be the
> culpability of the governor for not providing better protection for
> the prophet. He then wrote a prayer, that, though vengeful in its
> tone, is a perfect reflection of the anger and frustration felt by
> many at the sudden tragedy:
> 
> “And now O God wilt thou not come out of thy hiding place and avenge
> the blood of thy servants.--that blood which thou hast so long watched
> over with a fatherly care--that blood so noble--so generous--so
> dignified, so heavenly you O Lord will thou not avenge it speedily and
> bring down vengeance upon the murderers of thy servants that they may
> be rid from off the earth and that the earth may be cleansed from
> these scenes, even so O Lord thy will be done. We look to thee for
> justice. Hear thy people O God of Jacob even so Amen”
> 
> Clayton saw the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum arrive in Nauvoo about 2
> P.M. and was part of the large procession of mourners that collected
> on the hill and followed them to the Mansion House. There they heard
> exhortations to be peaceful and calm and not to utter threats. He
> concluded his diary entry for the day:
> 
> “Few expressions were heard save the mourns for the loss of our
> friends. All seem to hang on the merch of God and wait further events.
> Some few can scarce refrain from expressing aloud their indignation at
> the Governor and a few words would raise the City in arms & massacre
> the Cities of Carthage & Warsaw & lay them in ashes but it is wisdom
> to be quiet. After the bodies were laid out I went to see them. Joseph
> looks very natural except being pale through loss of blood. Hyrum does
> not look so natural. Their aged mother is distracted with grief & it
> will be almost more than she can bear.”
> 
> “The blood of those men,” he wrote in that long entry of June 28, “and
> the prayers of the widows and orphans and a suffering community will
> rise up to the Lord of Sabaoth for vengeance upon those murderers.”

> The under sheriff and jailer lived in the jail. The jail was a two

> room up stairs was a kind of a family room. At the head of the stairs
> there was two doors, one entering into the family room and the other
> entering into the jail proper.

> I have tried to be a little particular in discribing the house so as

> this new company or mob as they realy were had some understanding of
> some of the citizens of our town. I want you to know and believe, my
> daughter, that I had nothing (to) do with the murder of the Smiths, or
> any other person and during all the excitement I never did any thing
> to any one that I would not under like circumstances they should do to
> me.
> 
> I said I thought some of our citizens — citizens of Carthage I mean —
> was privy to the hole matter. One of them, a prominent man and a man
> of influence, came to me just befor the cowardly murder was committed
> and asked me to go out on the road toward Nauvoo and see what was
> going on out that way. I went and John Wilson an old citizen and
> Doctor Morrison a prominent Physician went with me. We went about
> three miles from Carth- age, on the Nauvoo road, where we had a fine
> view of the country all around, the country being pararie all around,
> we could see very plain where the Carthage and Warsaw road was. We saw
> going on that road quite a company going hurriedly in the direction
> (of) Carthage. It was not long till we could see quite a number on the
> same road going toward Warsaw. We then went back to Carthage to report
> and what did we find. Such a sight as I hope never to see again.
> 
> When we saw that company going to and from Carthage my suspicions was
> arroused that all was not right. Afterwards my suspicions was
> strengthened from the fact that a guard of the "Carthage Greys" a part
> of a Millitary company had been left in charge of the accused to
> protect and kepe them safe, whose sworn duty it was to protect their
> prisoner as well as it was to keep him from running off. They were
> there I don't know just how many. I think from six to ten men on guard
> when the mob came rushing on them, they fired blank cartridges over
> the heads of the mob as I afterwards learned from some one of the
> guard. My impresion is that they were equal guilty as any one of the
> mob. Excuse me for calling the murders of the Smith a mob. I think
> that is the right name to call them, though I believe I do not know if
> that you had an uncle in the affair. Well after the brave guards had
> fired their blank carheridge on the mob as I was taken prisoners, the
> mob rushed up stairs to where the Smiths Taylor and Richards were
> enjoying themselves. Some said they were sipping their wine whether
> that is true or not I do not know. At any rate they were comfortably
> situated, and they had a right to suppose safely protected by the laws
> of the great state of Illinois.
> 
> When the false guard had made their hypocritical assault on the other
> part of the mob (I look upon them as being equally guilty as those
> that came from Warsaw.) They the attacking party rushed up stairs with
> murder in their hearts to where the accused were tryed to break open
> the door which it appears was held shut by all four of the men when
> the mob commenced firing heir loaded arms through the door. It appears
> that one of the balls in the commencement of the attac pased through a
> panel of the door and hit Hyrum in his neck which probably broke his
> neck he fell back and died, as I was informed instantly. When I went
> into the room shortly afterwards his head was laying against the wall
> on the other sid from the door.
> 
> It is supposed when Hyrum fell the door was partially opened by the
> attacking party, so much so at any rate that I was informed that Jo
> Smith had what was common then what was and probable is now called one
> of Steves peper boxes. It is said and there is no dout but what it is
> true that he sliped his hand through the opening of the door and hit a
> young man from Warsaw about his neck or sholder which made it
> conveinent for the young man to remain for a while in Missouri. The
> attacing party forced the door open and commenced firing at Smith it
> is said they must have hit him an probably disabled him, as he
> stagered across the floor to the oposite side of the room where there
> was a window. It is said that there he gave the hailing sign of the
> distress of a Mason but that did him no good. In the room behind him
> was armed men, furious men, with murder in their hearts. Before him
> arround the well under the window there was a croud of desperate men,
> as he was receiving shots from behind which he could not stand, in
> despersation he leaped or rather fell out of the window near the well
> where he breathed his last. When I found him soon afterwards he was
> laying in the hall at the foot of the stairs where his blood had as I
> believe left indelible stain on the floor.
> 
> I suppose by this time you are anxious to know what became of Taylor
> and Richards; was they also killed, no they were not. Taylor was
> severely wounded Richards was not hurt. Shall I try to describe the
> wounds that Taylor received and got over them. Well let me tell you
> where we found him, I cannot impress your mind of his appearance as he
> appered to us when we wer called to him by the jailor. We found him in
> a pile of straw. It appeared that a straw bed had been emtied in the
> cell where he was when we found him. He was very much frightened as
> well as severly wounded. It took strong persuading of the jailor as
> well as our positive assuriance that we ment him no harm but Was
> desirous of doing him some good. He finally consented to come out of
> his cell. When we examined him we found that he had been hit by four
> balls. One ball had hit him in his fore arm and pased down and lodged
> in the hand betwen the phalanges of his third and fourth fingers.
> Another hit on the left side of the pelvis cuttin through the skin and
> pasin leaving a superficial wound that you could lay your hand in. A
> third ball passed through his thigh lodging in his notus. A fourth
> ball hit his watch which he had in the fob in his pantaloons, which I
> suppose the Mormons have today, to show the precise time that their
> great leader was killed. The wounds had bled quite freely, the blood
> had had time to coagulate which it had done, and where the clothes and
> straw came in contact they all adhered together so that Mr. Taylor
> came out his self sought cell he was a pitable looking sight. We took
> the best care of him we could till he left us. He got well but never
> 
> paid us for skill or good wishes.
> 
> You want to know what has become of Richards. He was not hurt. You
> will ask how did it happen that his comrads (were) so badly treated
> and he came off without receiving any damage whatever. It was in this
> way, as I suppose I think he told me so. The four braced themselves
> against the door to keep the mob out. He stood next to the hinges of
> the door so when the door opened it would turn back against the wall
> that divided the room that they were in from the prison room. So when
> they crowded the door open it shut him up against the wall and he
> stood there and did not move till the affair was all over, so they did
> not see him.
> 
> After we were through with Taylor I went to Richards and said to him
> Richards what does all this mean who done it. Said he, doctor I do not
> know, but I belive it was some Missourians that came over and have
> killed brothers Josef and Hyrum and wounded bro Taylor. Said I to him
> do you believe that, he said I do. Says I, will you write that down
> and send it to Nauvoo. He said he would if he could get any person to
> take it. I told him if he would write it I would send it. He wrote the
> note, I found the man that took it to Nauvoo.

> 
> It was now reduced to a demonstration that our enemies were determined
> that the law should not benefit us, and that nothing could be hoped
> for from the Governor. They had for a long time sought the life of the
> Prophet, and now it seemed as if they were determined to have it.
> There was but one alternative left, and that was to make his escape.
> He meditated doing so for a time and had crossed over the river that
> he might deliberate on the course to pursue, whether to go away for a
> season or offer himself for his people. When. he thought of going
> away, the certainty of the destruction of the city, together with the
> people whom he loved, and whom he had been the means of collecting
> from the four winds, would rise in his imagination before him, and
> reproach him with the calamity that his absence would bring upon them.
> Thus he mused within himself and with his brother Hyrum, and at length
> they both determined to return, and stand between the brethren and the
> rage of the mob. They now prepared to go to Carthage, and, on leaving,
> Joseph returned the second and third time, and at each time took an
> affectionate leave of his family. On his way out, he said, to the few
> of his friends who accompanied him, these remarkable words-
> 
> "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's
> morning: I have a conscience void of offense towards God and towards
> all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me, He was
> murdered in cold blood."
> 
> Immediately after this, and while these voluntary martyrs were on
> their way, an order from the governor, who knew of their approach, met
> them, demanding all the State arms belonging to the Nauvoo Legion. It
> appears his Excellency feared that the Legion, although disbanded,
> might avenge any outrage that might be committed on the persons of
> their leaders, and so thought he had better disarm them, as he had
> already disbanded them This order was also promptly obeyed, although
> the mob were suffered to retain their arms, even when within a half
> day's march of us, and in a threatening and hostile attitude; while
> the Legion had not evinced any disposition whatever, except to defend
> their city in case it should be invaded, and had not set a foot
> without the limits of the corporation. This last demand was so
> manifestly void of all good feeling, and so unjust withal, that it was
> thought advisable, by these devoted heroes, for Joseph Smith to return
> in person to Nauvoo, lest the officers and men, in their great
> indignation, should treat such an arbitrary demand with contempt, and,
> perhaps, disobey it. He accordingly returned, and having accomplished
> the delivery of the public arms, he again set out, accompanied by his
> brother Hyrum, who never forsook him, for the head quarters of
> mobocracy--Carthage, where they arrived late the same night, having
> travailed nearly the whole distance from Nauvoo to Carthage three
> times that day.
> 
> On the following morning the Governor's mobocratic troops were all
> paraded and formed in line for review. This done, his Excellency
> passed along their front, accompanied by Generals Joseph and Hyrum
> Smith, whom he introduced to the troops as military officers, calling
> them General Joseph and General Hyrum Smith. Whether he did this out
> of respect to his distinguished prisoners, or whether he did it to
> gratify the mob with a sight of their intended victims, can be pretty
> correctly inferred from the proceedings already related. But some of
> the troops doubtless misconstrued his Excellency's object, and thought
> he was doing these men, whom they regarded as criminals, too much
> honour, and therefore mutinied, and became exceedingly boisterous, and
> for a time it was feared that nothing could stay their hands from
> violence and bloodshed. The Governor, however, succeeded in pacifying
> them by making to them a speech, in which he promised them full
> satisfaction. But as this was made in public, he of course had to
> promise it through a lawful channel. These mutineers, I wish it
> distinctly remembered, were the "Carthage Greys. " The prisoners, for
> so they were considered, delivered themselves into the hands of the
> constable, and they were brought before the magistrate for examination
> on the charge of riot. And after every effort was made on the part of
> the prosecution to prevent it, they, with some of the City Council and
> a number of policemen, who had also obeyed the warrant, succeeded in
> giving the required bail to answer to the charges preferred, before
> the next Circuit Court. It is worthy here to notice, that in case the
> charges could have been sustained at court, the prisoners could have
> been fined only at most in the sum of two hundred dollars; yet this
> military esquire absolutely demanded the sum of five hundred dollars
> for each man's recognizance, which was two-and-a-half times as much as
> the penalty of actual guilt. The prisoners being fifteen in number,
> the court hoped that the required sum could not be vouched for by
> those present, and that they must consequently be committed to jail.
> But there was strength enough at hand, and a sufficiency of
> unquestionable bail, notwithstanding the unparalleled amount, was
> instantly forthcoming, and the prisoners were once more free men. But
> liberty was not for them, for in less than half-an-hour, there was a
> [<u>Mittimus </u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant)served
> on Joseph and Hyrum Smith, against whom the spite of the mob was
> always directed. In this Mittimus, the constable was ordered to
> confine them in jail.
> 
> But I am a little before my story. I should have said that on the
> morning of the arrival of the Smiths in Carthage, to answer for a
> charge of riot, they were both apprehended on the charge of Treason.
> But the case on the charge of riot came on first, and terminated as
> stated above; and the prisoners had not, as yet, been brought before
> the justice, in the case of treason, for examination. He could not,
> therefore, legally imprison them; but he was captain of the mutinous
> "Carthage Greys, " as well as justice of the peace, and of course
> things had to go according to his liking. So notwithstanding the
> protests of Mr. Smith's counsel, of illegality, he had them dragged to
> jail by a company of armed men, detailed for the purpose; and although
> the Governor had previously pledged his honour, and the honour of the
> State, in case the Smiths should drive themselves up; that they should
> be protected from illegal violence, and that the law only was sought
> to be enforced. This pledge he frequently repeated; yet when they had
> confided in the strong assurances of his Excellency, and had submitted
> to, and were willing to abide, the law of the land, and while being
> illegally ordered to be imprisoned by this military magistrate, they
> appealed in vain, again and again, to the Governor himself, reminding
> him of his pledges, to arrest that order from being executed. His
> Excellency pleaded that he had no authority to stay civil process, or
> the due course of law; that the prisoners were in the hands of the
> civil authorities, and that he could not interrupt a civil officer in
> the discharge of his duty. But what are the facts? A justice of the
> peace, acting as a military officer also, by virtue of his commission
> as such, orders his command to appear under arms and to safely
> incarcerate the prisoners, whom he had just before ordered the
> constable to commit to jail by Mittimus ere they had been brought
> before him for examination; and the Governor, having been himself, at
> one time, a judge upon the bench, knew and well understood the
> illegality of the above proceedings; he also well knew that military
> power and authority were used; and yet he, acting at that time as
> Commander-in-Chief, in a military point of view, which gave him all
> the supervision over all his officers, and, in fact, made him
> responsible for all their acts and movements, refused to interfere, or
> to countermand the order-the illegal, oppressive, and unofficer-like
> order, of one of his captains. But again, having taken the oath of
> office, he was, by virtue of that oath, bound to see the laws
> faithfully executed, and not violated and trodden under foot, and that
> right in his presence, and at a time too, when he had the bone and
> sinew of the State, over which he then presided, collected together
> for the express purpose, professedly, at least, of enforcing the law,
> magnifying it, and making it honourable. I would here stop to inquire,
> whether his Excellency did not render himself liable to be
> court-martialed and cashiered for unofficer-like conduct; and also to
> impeachment, for a neglect and violation of his oath of office, as the
> chief magistrate of a great State? I give the affirmative as my
> deliberate opinion in both specifications.
> 
> But the prisoners being committed, and as the Mittimus recited, "
> until discharged by due course of law," the magistrate had no further
> jurisdiction over them. They ought, therefore, to have remained there
> until the session of the next Court, or have been brought out by
> Habeas Corpus. On the next day, however, the esquire ordered the
> constable to bring them before him into the Courthouse for
> examination. The legal objections were now made by them and their
> counsel, and they refused to go; but there was a way to make them. He
> had a curious and convenient coat or badge of office, which, by a

> civil, now military, and in this last, he ordered his " b'hoys," the "
> Greys," to assist the constable and bring them This done, the
> prisoners required time to procure the necessary witnesses, and
> prepare for the examination. This was with great difficulty obtained.
> The day was already far spent, say five o'clock, p.m., and time was
> only given till twelve the next day, in which to write out some thirty

> remanded to prison. (This is only one instance of a constant scene of
> oppression to which these men have ever been exposed.)
> 
> It was not until during this imprisonment that the Governor redeemed
> his oft-repeated promise to give General Smith a personal interview.
> He accordingly made his appearance with a friend of his on the first
> day of their incarceration, when the General, like Paul, had the
> privilege of answering for himself. He adverted to all the leading
> causes which gave rise to the difficulties under consideration, in a
> brief, but lucid, energetic, and impressive manner. The Governor felt
> that what was said was true. General Smith read copies of all the
> orders and proceedings of the City Council of Nauvoo concerning the
> destruction of the Expositor, and of the correspondence forwarded to
> his Excellency in relation thereto; and also informed him concerning
> the call of the Legion, and the position they occupied of absolute
> necessity-not to make war upon or invade the rights of any portion of
> the State, but as the last resort, and only defence, in the absence of
> executive protection, against a large organized military and
> mobocratic foe. The General reminded his Excellency that the question
> in dispute was a civil matter, and to settle which, needed no resort
> to arms; and that he was ready at any time, and had always been to
> answer to any charge in the premises, that might be preferred against
> him, either as Mayor of the city, or as a private individual, in any
> court of justice, unintimidated by a mob or military array; and make
> all the satisfaction that the law required, if any, etc. The Governor
> said he had not called out this force, but found it assembled in
> military order, on his arrival at that place; and that the law must be
> enforced, but that the prisoners must and should be protected; and
> that he again Pledged his word, and the faith and honour of the State,
> that they should be. He also stated that he intended to march his
> troops (that is, those who had assembled for mobocratic purposes, and
> whom he had mustered into service) into Nauvoo, to gratify them, and
> that the prisoners should accompany them, and then return again to
> attend the trial before the said magistrate, which he said had been
> postponed for the purpose of making this visit.
> 
> Afterwards, however, his Excellency called a council, of war, I
> suppose, where it was determined to change the order of the day. The
> troops were now all to be disbanded, excepting two companies. At the
> head of the one which was from M'Donnough County, he marched into
> Nauvoo; while he had detailed the other, the mutinous "Carthage Greys,
> " to guard and protect the prisoners whom he left in the jail, in
> direct violation of the pledges he had made to them on the previous
> day. All the other troops were disbanded and ordered home, while there
> yet retained also a body of several hundred men, eight or ten miles
> out, apparently under the control of no one, except Col. Williams, a
> sworn enemy, who, it is well known, had on more occasions than one,
> not only threatened Nauvoo with destruction, but the Prophet with
> death. This was the condition of things on the morning of the 27th
> June, the day on which was acted the most unheard of and unprecedented
> tragedy that, in my opinion, can be found on record. JOSEPH and HYRUM,
> the Prophet and Patriarch, were that day slain by wicked hands, WHILE
> IMMURED, IN PRISON. And thus was shed, on that memorable day, the best
> blood, and the noblest too, of the nineteenth century.

> first making call upon some of their colonels or other officers in
> their respective military districts.
> 
> But again, instead of remaining upon the ground to see that his orders
> were complied with, he forthwith put himself at the head of a company,
> I suppose as a body guard, and took up a line of march for Nauvoo,
> where he took occasion, after calling the multitude together, to
> insult them in a speech of some twenty minutes, in a most gross and
> ignominious manner, unbecoming any public functionary, charging them
> with movements, acts, and inconsistencies, which were utterly untrue,
> and never existed, only in the foul throats of our most inveterate
> traducers, who had the adroitness to ingratiate themselves into his
> good graces, and prejudice him against us. While these things were
> going on, much to his satisfaction, the prisoners in jail were left to
> be guarded ostensibly, by the before mentioned "Carthage Greys," who,
> only two days before, came near committing murder, as well as mutiny,
> right in his presence; and of those, only eight men were detailed to
> stand guard at a time, at the jail, while the rest remained in camp on
> the public square, one quarter of a mile off. Thus were these intended
> victims, instead of being protected, left at that momentous crisis,
> with but two of their friends with them, to wit: Elders Willard

> remained with them until he was sent to Nauvoo, only several hours
> previous to the fatal catastrophe, to aid in forwarding witnesses. And
> Colonel Markham, who had also remained with them, was run out of town
> the same day, before the bayonets of a promiscuous crowd, who
> threatened his life, while making a few little purchases for the
> prisoners. And, as might have been expected, a little after five
> o'clock in the evening, at the very time that his Excellency was
> insulting the peaceable citizens of Nauvoo, a body of about one
> hundred and fifty armed men, with painted faces, appeared before the
> jail, unobserved by the inmates, and without opposition from any
> quarter. The guard at the door, it is said, elevated their firelocks
> at the approach of these men in disguise, and, boisterously
> threatening them, discharged them over their heads. The crowd by this
> time had encircled the building: some shoved the guard from their
> post; rushed up the flight of stairs to the prisoners' apartment,
> which for that day was in an upper open room; broke open the door, and
> began the work of death, while others fired in through the open
> windows. Dr. Richards, with Colonel Markham's heavy walking stick,
> defended the door, knocking down, and to one side, the muzzles of the
> assailants' guns, as they fired into the room; and, strange to say,

[<u>http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n12.htm</u>](http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n12.htm).

> Awful assassination of JOSEPH AND HYRUM SMITH\!-The pledged faith of
> the state of Illinois stained with innocent blood by a Mob\!
> 
> On Monday the 24th inst., after Gov. Ford had sent word, that those
> eighteen persons demanded on a warrant, among whom were Joseph Smith
> and Hyrum Smith should be protected, by the militia of the State, they
> in company with some ten or twelve others, started for Carthage. Four
> miles from that place, they were met by Capt. Dunn, with a company of
> cavalry, who had an order from the Governor for the "State Arms." Gen.
> Smith endorsed his acceptance of the same, and both parties returned
> to Nauvoo to obtain said arms. After the arms were obtained, both
> parties took up the line of march for Carthage, where they arrived
> about five minutes before twelve o'clock at night. Capt. Dunn nobly
> acquitting himself, landed us safely at Hamilton's hotel
> 
> In the morning we saw the governor, and he pledged the faith of the
> State, that we should be protected. Gen. Smith and his brother Hyrum
> were arrested by a warrant founded upon the oaths of H. O. Norton and
> Agustine Spencer for treason. Knowing the threats from several
> persons, that the two Smiths should never leave Carthage alive, we all
> began to be alarmed for their personal safety. The Gov. and Gen.
> Deming conducted them before the McDonough troops and introduced them
> as Gen. Joseph Smith and Gen. Hyrum Smith.-This manœuvre \[maneuver\]
> came near raising a mutiny among the "Carthage Greys," but the
> governor quelled it.
> 
> In the afternoon, after great exertions on the part of our counsel, we
> dispensed with an investigation, and voluntarily gave bail for our
> appearance to the Circuit Court, to answer in the case of abating the
> Nauvoo Expositor, as a nuisance.
> 
> At evening the Justice made out a mittimus, without an investigation,
> and committed the two Gen. Smiths to prison until discharged by due
> course of law, and they were safely guarded to jail. In the morning
> the Governor went to the jail and had an interview with these men, and
> to every appearance all things were explained on both sides.
> 
> The constable then went to take these men from the jail, before the
> Justice for examination, but the jailer refused to let them go, as
> they were under his direction "till discharged by due course of law;"
> but the governor's troops, to the amount of one or two hundred, took
> them to the Court House, when the hearing was continued till Saturday
> the 29th, and they were remanded to jail. Several of our citizens had
> permits from the Governor to lodge with them, and visit them in jail.
> It now began to be rumored by several men, whose names will be
> forthcoming in time, that there was nothing against these men, the law
> could not reach them, but powder and ball would\! The Governor was
> made acquainted with these facts, but on the morning of the 27th, he
> disbanded the McDonough troops, and sent them home; took Captain
> Dunn's company of cavalry and proceeded to Nauvoo, leaving these two
> men and three or four friends, to be guarded by eight men at the jail;
> and a company in town of 60 men, 80 or 100 rods from the jail, as a
> corps in reserve.
> 
> About six o'clock in the afternoon the guard was surprised by an armed
> mob from 150 to 250, painted red, black and yellow, which surrounded
> the jail, forced in-poured a shower of bullets into the room where
> these unfortunate men were held, "in durance vile," to answer the laws
> of Illinois; under the solemn pledge of the faith of the State, by
> Gov. Ford, that they should be protected\! but the mob ruled\!\! They
> fell as martyrs amid this tornado of lead, each receiving four

H. T. Reid, Statement of Facts, *Times & Seasons*,
[<u>http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n12.htm</u>](http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n12.htm)

> STATEMENT OF FACTS\!
> 
> At the request of many persons who wish that the truth may go forth to
> the world in relation to the late murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, by
> a band of lawless assassins, I have consented to make a statement of
> the facts so far as they have come to my knowledge, in an authentic
> shape, as one of the attorneys employed to defend the said Smiths
> against the charges brought against them; and other persons at
> Carthage in the State of Illinois.
> 
> On Monday the 24th inst., at the request of Gen. Smith I left Fort
> Madison in the Territory of Iowa and arrived at Carthage where I
> expected to meet the General, his brother Hyrum and the other persons
> implicated with them; they arrived at Carthage late at night and next
> morning voluntarily surrendered themselves to the constable, Mr.
> Bettersworth, who held the writ against them on a charge of riot for
> destroying the press, type and fixtures of the Nauvoo Expositor, the
> property of William and Wilson Law, and other dissenters, charged to
> have been destroyed on the 10th inst.
> 
> Great excitement prevailed in the county of Hancock, and had extended
> to many of the surrounding counties. A large number of the militia of
> several counties were under arms at Carthage the Head Quarters of the
> commanding Gen. Deming; and many other troops were under arms at
> Warsaw and other places in the neighborhood. The Governor was at Head
> Quarters in person, for the purpose \[of\] seeing that the laws of the
> land were executed and had pledged his own faith and the faith of the
> State of Illinois that the Smiths and the other persons concerned with
> them should be protected from personal violence, if they would
> surrender themselves to be dealt with according to law. During the two
> succeeding says his Excellency repeatedly expressed to the legal
> counselors of the Smiths his determination to protect the prisoners
> and to see that they have a fair and impartial examination \[as\] far
> as depended on the Executive of the State. On Tuesday morning soon
> after the surrender of the prisoners on the charge of riot, Gen.
> Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were both arrested on a charge of
> treason against the State of Illinois. The affidavits upon which the
> writs \[were\] issued were made by Hyrum Norton and Augustine Spencer.
> 
> On Tuesday afternoon the two Smiths and other persons, on the charge
> of riot, appeared before R. F. Smith, a justice of the peace residing
> at Carthage, and by advice of counsel, in order to prevent if
> possible, any increase of excitement, voluntarily entered into
> recognizance in the sum of five hundred dollars each with
> unexceptionable security for their appearance at the next term of the
> Circuit Court for said county. The whole number of persons recognized
> is fifteen, most if not all of them leading men in the Mormon church.
> 
> Making out the bonds and justifying bail necessary consumed
> considerable time, and when this was done it was near night, and the
> Justice adjourned his court over without calling on the Smiths to
> answer to the charge of treason or even intimating to their counsel of
> the prisoners that they were expected to enter into the examination
> that night. In less than an hour after the adjournment of the court,
> constable Bettersworth who had arrested the prisoners in the morning,
> appeared at Hamilton's Hotel, at the lodgings of the prisoners and
> their counsel and insisted that the Smiths should go to jail. Mr.
> Woods of Burlington, Iowa, and myself, as counsel for the prisoners;
> insisted that they were entitled to be brought before the justice for
> examination before they should be sent to jail. The constable to our
> surprise, there-upon exhibited a mittimus from said justice as
> follows:
> 
> State of Illinois, Hancock County.
> 
> The people of the State of Illinois to the keeper of the jail of the
> said county, greeting:
> 
> Whereas Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith of the county aforesaid have been
> arrested upon the oath of Augustine Spencer and Henry O. Norton, for
> the crime of treason, and have been brought before me as a Justice of
> the Peace in and for said county, for trial at the seat of Justice
> there of, which trial has been necessarily postponed by reason of the
> absence of material witnesses, to wit Francis M. Higbee and others;
> therefore I command you in the name of the people to receive the said
> Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith into your custody in the jail of the
> county aforesaid, there to remain until discharged by due course of
> law.
> 
> Given under my hand and seal this 25th day of June, A. D. 1844.
> 
> (Signed.)
> 
> R. P. SMITH, J. P. {L. S.}
> 
> His Excellency did not think it within the sphere of his duty to
> interfere, and the prisoners were removed from their lodgings to jail.
> The recitals of the mittimus before the justice for trial, and it
> there appearing that the necessary witnesses of the prosecution were
> absent, is wholly untrue, unless the prisoners could have appeared
> before the justice without being present in person or by counsel; nor
> is there any law of Illinois within my knowledge which permits a
> justice to commit persons charged with crimes, to jail without
> examination as to the probability of their guilt.
> 
> On Wednesday forenoon the Governor in company with one of his friends
> visited the prisoners at the jail, and again assured them that they
> should be protected from violence, and told them if the troops marched
> the next morning to Nauvoo as his Excellency then expected they should
> be taken along, in order to insure their personal safety.
> 
> On the same morning, some one or more of the counsel for the
> prosecution, expressed their wish to me, that the prisoners should be
> brought out of jail for examination; they were answered that the
> prisoners had already been examined, and that the justice and
> constable had no further control of the prisoners and that if the
> prosecutors wished the prisoners brought out of jail, they should
> bring them out on a writ of Habeas Corpus or some other due course of
> law. The constable after this conversation went to the jail with the
> following order to the jailer:
> 
> State of Illinois, Hancock County. ss.
> 
> To David Bettersworth, constable of said county:
> 
> You are commanded to bring the bodies of Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith
> from the jail of said county, forthwith before me at my office for an
> examination on the charge of treason, they having been committed for
> safe keeping until trial could be had on such examination and the
> state now being ready for such examination.
> 
> Given under my hand and seal this 26th day of June 1844.
> 
> (Signed.)
> 
> R. P. SMITH, J. P. {L. S.}
> 
> And demanded the prisoners, but as the jailer could find no law
> authorizing a justice of the peace, to demand prisoners committed to
> his charge, he refused to give them up, until discharged from his
> custody by due course of law. Upon the refusal to give up the
> prisoners the company of Carthage Greys marched to the jail, by whose
> orders I know not, and compelled the jailer against his will and
> conviction of duty, to deliver the prisoners to the constable, who,
> forthwith, took them before Justice Smith, the Captain of the Carthage
> Greys. The counsel for prisoners then appeared, and asked for
> subpoenas for witnesses on the part of the prisoners, and expressed
> their wish to go into the examination soon, as witnesses could be
> brought from Nauvoo to Carthage; the justice thereupon fixed the
> examination for 12 o'clock, on Thursday the 27th inst.; whereupon, the
> prisoners were remanded to prison. Soon after a council of the
> military officers was called by the Governor, and was determined to
> march the next morning, the 27th inst. to Nauvoo, with all the troops,
> except one company which was to be selected by the Governor from the
> troops whose fidelity was more to be relied on to guard the prisoners,
> whom it was determined should be left at Carthage. On Thursday

> TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
> 
> I desire to make a brief but true statement of the recent disgraceful
> affair at Carthage, in regard to the Smiths, so far as circumstances
> have come to my knowledge. The Smiths, Joseph and Hyrum, have been
> assassinated in jail, by whom it is not known, but will be
> ascertained. I pledged myself for their safety, and upon the assurance
> of that pledge, they surrendered as prisoners. The Mormons surrendered
> the public arms in their possession, and the Nauvoo Legion submitted
> to the command of Capt. Singleton, of Brown county, deputed for that
> purpose by me. All these things were required to satisfy the old
> citizens of Hancock that the Mormons were peaceably disposed; and to
> allay jealousy and excitement in their minds. It appears however that
> the compliance of the Mormons with every requisition made upon them
> failed of that purpose. The pledge of security to the Smiths, was not
> given upon my individual responsibility. Before I gave it, I obtained
> a pledge of honor by a unanimous vote from the officers and men under
> my command, to sustain me in performing it. If the assassination of
> the Smiths was committed by any portion of these, they have added
> treachery to murder, and have done all they could to disgrace the
> state, and sully public honor.
> 
> On the morning of the day the deed was committed, we had proposed to
> march the army under my command into Nauvoo. I had however discovered
> on the evening before, that nothing but utter destruction of the city
> would satisfy a portion of the troops; and that if we marched into the
> city, pretexes\[ pretexts\] would not be wanting for commencing
> hostilities. The Mormons had done every thing required, or which ought
> to have been required of them. Offensive operations on our part would
> have been as unjust and disgraceful, as they would have been
> impolitic, in the present critical season of the year, the harvest and
> the crops. For these reasons I decided in a council of officers, to
> disband the army, except three companies, two of which were reserved
> as guards for the jail.-With the other company I marched into Nauvoo,
> to address the inhabitants there, and tell them what they might expect
> in case they designedly or imprudently provoked a war. I performed
> this duty as I think plainly and emphatically, and then set out to
> return to Carthage.-When I had marched about three miles, a messenger
> informed me of the occurrences at Carthage. I hastened on to that
> place. The guard it is said did their duty but were overpowered. Many
> of the inhabitants of Carthage had fled with their families. Others
> were preparing to go. I apprehended danger in the settlements from the
> sudden fury and passion of the Mormons and sanctioned their movements
> in this respect.
> 
> General Damming volunteered to remain with a few troops to observe the

1840–60, Church History Library; punctuation as in original. Jason R.
Luce recalled the conversation between a man named Powers and a Mr.
Davis when a group met on June 11, 1844, to discuss the men returning
over the river and going to Carthage:

> Powers said they would attempt to kill Joseph— Mr. Davis replied No I

Jonathan Calkins Wright, Affidavit, January 13, 1855, Joseph Smith
history documents, 1840–60. (Recollection of a conversation between him
and Colonel Enoch C. March between the Mansion House and Richard
Brersier’s Ferry Landing on Water Street in Nauvoo on June 26, 1844, at
about 5 p.m., after he met with George T. M. Davis, editor of the Alton
Telegraph, when March’s soldiers had come looking for Joseph and were
unable to find him. Wright bore witness to March that he had a testimony
of Joseph Smith’s prophetic calling, and this is March’s reply.)

(Misspellings in title and numerous transpositions of letters and
misspellings in narrative retained as in original.) Robert F. Smith,
captain of the Carthage Greys, was also the local judge and was so busy
during this period that he did not have time to sleep during the night
leading up to the martyrdom. His wife left the following account of that
last day.

> That day \[June 27, 1844\] I was unusually depressed and out of sorts.

> prairie some a few miles out and were on the road to Carthage. Some
> thought they were Mormans comeing to liberate the Smiths from jail and

> began to make preperations to leave their homes with their families
> and the part of town where I lived was soon entirely deserted but

> And even though J. Smith could have saved himself from their clutches
> in many ways; yes, even though hundreds gathered around him begging
> him with tears on their cheeks, out of fondness for him, not to go to
> the slaughter--for almost everyone including himself believed that
> would not come back alive--he went. And I shall never forget that
> scene when he stood in the middle, and looking around him, then at the
> city its inhabitants who were so dear to him, he said, "if I do not go
> there, the result will be the destruction of this city and its
> inhabitants; and I cannot think of my dear brothers and sisters and
> their children suffering the scenes of Missouri again in Nauvoo; it is
> better for your brother, Joseph, to die for his brothers and sisters,
> for I am willing to die for them. My work is finished; the Lord has
> heard my prayers and has promised that we shall have rest from such
> cruelties before long, and so do not prevent me with your tears from
> going to bliss." And after embracing his little children who were
> clinging to his clothes and after bidding a tender farewell to his
> wife whom he loved greatly, also in tears, and after giving the last
> comfort to his aged, saintly mother, he addressed the entire crowd
> with great effect, exhorting them to be faithful in the way and with
> the religion which he had taught them. And in that way he could greet
> them before long out of reach of mobs and every oppression, and he was
> sealing his testimony to that with his blood; and if he had a thousand
> lives it would be worth them all.
> 
> After this wondrous and heartrending scene which tongue cannot tell
> nor can pen record, we left his house on horses, but totally disarmed
> except for a few of us who had pistol in our pockets. When we were on
> higher ground where the temple was and a host was following to catch
> the last glimpse of him, he stood and looked back on the city for a
> moment in great solemnity, and then he said. "Oh, city, once the most
> blessed, but now the most pitiful in sadness. This is the kindest and
> most godly people and most beloved by Heaven of all the world. Oh, if
> only they knew what awaits them." But he restrained himself and after
> looking over it again, we proceeded on toward Carthage.
> 
> On the way we met some of the messengers who had gone there Saturday
> night, and some who had been released from prison that morning. They
> described the rioters in an unruly and bloodthirsty state. When within
> four miles of Carthage, we met a large company of armed men alongside
> us totally unexpectedly. And when they saw us, they formed to attack.
> At that, Joseph Smith halted his horse in the middle of the road, and
> he addressed us cheerfully and fearlessly, exhorting us, "Dear
> Brethren, you cannot come with me any further; retreat for your lives
> and let them pour out all their vengeance upon my head; I shall suffer
> it, for I am going like a lamb to the slaughter with a conscience void
> of offense toward God and men."
> 
> And at this he was surrounded by the soldiers (as we understood them
> to be) with their swords bared, and the Captain ordered him to
> surrender. Then his soldiers, as if they had won the battle of
> Waterloo, shouted three cheers for their victory. J. Smith addressed
> them briefly and succinctly, and he showed to them that he had never
> been an enemy to them, nor had he ever disobeyed any of the laws, and
> as proof of their wrong idea about him he was now on his way
> voluntarily, unobliged, into the midst of them who thirsted after his
> blood. And he said, "I would ask one favor from you if you are
> Americans; do not deny me\! If you have any humanity in you and honor
> or human feelings, do not deny this my last request\! This big favor
> is that you defend my life so that I shall have a fair trial before
> the court of my country. I do not fear the consequence, be it even the
> most horrible death, as much as I fear dying with a blemish on my
> character, or for the world to disgrace the religion which I profess.
> Will you promise this?" he asked publicly.
> 
> Their Captain answered immediately (i.e., Dunn; he and his army had
> come from MacDonough County and were totally ignorant before this of
> Joseph Smith), "If this is the Joe Smith whose evils we have heard so
> much about, I am completely disappointed. We have heard all lies,
> boys, and I know that this is a good man no matter who he is, and I
> (said he with a great oath) an determined to defend him until he has a
> fair trial though it should cost me my own life." And his whole army
> agreed to the same thing through "three cheers for Joe Smith," even
> louder than before\! After this, Dunn showed a latter from Governor
> Ford ordering the people of Nauvoo to give up all their arms to him;
> and though it was a cruel and foolish request, yet the Saints obeyed
> and gave up quietly the only defense which they had for their lives in
> answer to the request of the governor, who at the request of the
> rioters had facilitated their murderous intentions. It is strange that
> the governor would do this without disarming the attackers if he was
> not of the same heart and mind as they\!
> 
> We turned back to Nauvoo; all the arms and cannons were gathered
> together. And in the afternoon we set off again toward Carthage where
> we arrived alive by midnight, even though the mobbers had tried to
> kill Joseph Smith in spite of the soldiers. We took lodging at the
> Hamilton Hotel, and the next morning we met with Governor Ford. He
> promised protection and justice to the prisoners. At the wish of the
> armies, Captain Deming went with J. and H. Smith before them; for
> there were hardly any of them who had ever seen them before, nor did
> they know anything about them except for the stories of the rioters.
> Because they considered that too much respect for the prisoners, it
> caused a great tumult amidst the army of the Carthage Grays. Their
> leader was Captain Smith (i.e., the judge who had issued the warrant,
> and he along with his army were the chief rioters). At last, through
> being threatened with imprisonment by the rest of the armies, the
> Carthage Grays calmed down.
> 
> In the afternoon an inquiry was held in the Hamilton Hotel, for it was
> too dangerous for the prisoners to appear in the courthouse. Because
> of the rage of the rioters, they chose to post bail for their
> appearance in the quarter session rather than go to the inquiry. Bail
> was posted and the City Council was allowed to return home; but the
> blood thirsty traitors had prepared another jail for J. and H. Smith
> by putting two of their number, by the names of H.O. Norton and A.
> Spencer (because of the latter there was the aforementioned tumult at
> the courthouse), to swear a warrant against them for treason against
> the state. At this the sheriff wished to transfer them to prison
> immediately, without an inquiry or anything; but the tumult along the
> streets was such that they refused to go without an escort to defend
> them.
> 
> And after dark the Carthage Gray came to the hotel and defended them
> as far as the jail in the midst of threats, oaths and swearing. The
> prisoners asked some of us to follow them to the jail "in order have
> our company," they said; but we knew before then that it was so that
> we could be proven witnesses of their words, their comportment and
> their character. To death we would follow them, and I am grateful for
> having such an honor. Woe unto us except we surely make the proper use
> of it.
> 
> We were all locked together in a dungeon which was about ten feet
> square; and there we spent the first night of our imprisonment in
> pleasant conversation about "the secret of godliness"; and such
> happiness possessed them when they foretold that both of them were
> about to finish their race and go to their joy. I had never seen them
> so cheerful and so heavenly minded, nor had I ever before thought that
> Carthage Jail was the gate of paradise.
> 
> The next morning we were all moved to an upstairs room of the jailer's
> house, to which the stairs led from the front door; this upper room
> had a very poor door without a lock or even a latch that would shut;
> it also had three large windows through which whoever wanted could
> shoot to every corner of the room through one or the other of them. We
> understood that the excitement among the mobs was because they had
> thrown the men into without any kind of inquiry, even though the judge
> had committed perjury by signing on their mittimus that there would
> be; and so they could not get out of jail whenever they wanted without
> the permission of the jailer. The latter, on seeing that they were
> eager to kill the prisoners and that many were hiding in the hummocks
> with their rifles ready to shoot as soon as they came out of the door,
> denied them permission.
> 
> Again and again the sheriff came to request them under the guise of
> going to the courthouse for trial, and the jailer refused to let them
> out unless one or two of the leaders of the mob could be obtained to
> walk arm in arm with the prisoners, for he considered that a stronger
> escort than the Carthage Grays and the lot; and like this they went
> about half a mile to the courthouse amidst such shouts and threats of
> the drunks, and curses of some who thirsted after their blood, until
> we imagined that it was not unlike that cruel scene on Calvary, and we
> heard words quite similar to those which were tauntingly said there,
> such as, "Now, old Joe (some said in his face), if you are a prophet,
> how did you come to the jail like this?" Another answered, "Oh, if Joe
> were a prophet, he would soon call for a legion of angels, and we
> would all be killed, and he would escape." Yes, some foolish
> observations like these filled his ears along the way to the
> courthouse where their professed enemy was again sitting in judgment
> on them, and his hostile partners were witnesses and lawyers against
> them. Only by earnest pleading by the prisoners' lawyers, i.e., Mr.
> Reid from Fort Madison and Mr. Woods from Burlington, was a
> postponement of the trial for the next day obtained, so that the
> witnesses who lived twenty miles away could be brought there. At last
> this was granted and the prisoners were taken back to the jail.
> 
> The magistrate refrained from signing the subpoenas to examine the
> witnesses for the defense, although he knew that no one else there
> could do that, until he thought that is was too late. the jail was
> watched by eight or ten of Captain Dunn's escort, and these were the

> that, other guards came to whom we would preach the same way.
> Occasionally, some of them would be so vengeful they would not allow
> Joseph Smith to speak, while at the same time they would listen to the
> others.
> 
> About twelve o'clock that night we lay down in the following way to
> sleep: Hyrum Smith and Dr. Willard Richards in the bed; Joseph Smith
> on one side of me and John Taylor on the other; Colonel Markham and
> another brother next to him were lying on the mattresses on the floor;
> and that is all there were of us. We expected nothing less than an
> attack on us nearly every hour; in spite of that the only defense that
> we could make was to put a chair against the door in such a way that
> it would fall if the door were opened. I had not fallen into a deep
> sleep when I heard the sound of heavy footsteps of an army coming
> toward us. I got up and spied through the window where by the light of
> the stars I saw soldiery at the door\! I observed what they said; but
> they were whispering so secretively that I could understand hardly
> anything but this: "How many shall go in?" When I heard that, I awoke
> by brethren; but there was no need to tell them why, for the sound of
> the feet rushing up to our door signified that it was time to beware.
> We stood by the door to attack the first to open it, and we clearly
> heard them breathing on the other side. There was tomblike silence for
> a minute or two, awaiting a shower of bullets perhaps in our midst;
> and then J. Smith asked bravely and loudly who was there and what did
> they want? He invited them in as we were ready to receive them, and it
> made no difference to him whether he died at that time or at daylight,
> etc. At that they stole down quietly; and from then to daylight they
> consulted near our windows what they would do. At times they decided
> to rush in on us, but before reaching the door, perhaps the other
> party would hold them back; and thus they continued until the
> assassin's terror, the morning light, scattered all of them except for
> about eight of the Carthage Grays who stayed there as guards.
> 
> In the morning I went at the request of J. Smith to the lower door to
> inquire what was the purpose of the confusion in the sergeant of the
> guards, who answered me with horrible curses, saying that the
> prisoners would never come our alive, that I would see before night
> that he was a better prophet than Joe Smith, and that I was not a bit
> better than, nor was anyone else who supported him. At this, I
> reminded the gentleman who and what he was, that Governor Ford under
> the oath of the state had promised protection to the prisoners and had
> put their lives in his hands, and that I would inform the governor of
> his threats, all of which infuriated him greatly. I went to the
> Hamilton Hotel and revealed the whole thing before Governor Ford; I
> reminded him of his promise to defend the prisoners and requested that
> he put some others to guard them in place of the Carthage Gray, who
> were thirsting after their blood. But all was in vain; he suggested
> that there was no danger at all. After that, I went into the midst of
> the large crowd of mobbers and heard their publicly proclaimed
> decision to make a sham discharge until Governor Ford left, after
> which they would return. They were determined to kill "Joe Smith" even
> if they had to tear down the jail.
> 
> After hearing such a verdict being sealed on the innocent with three
> cheers from the crowd, I returned and related everything to Governor
> Ford; but yet he did not consider it worth his attention\! I went
> hurriedly to inform the prisoners things, but the guard did not let me
> back in. The prisoners earnestly beseeched them to let me in, saying
> that the governor had granted permission for that (which he had
> promised when he visited the jail the day before); but all was in
> vain. For the third time I returned to the governor describing their
> danger and requested a pass from him to re-enter; he refused this
> also, even though I followed after him until he was on his horse to
> start with the escort toward Nauvoo; but he did order Captain Deming
> to give me a pass for Willard Richards as a scribe to the prisoners
> and to no one else.
> 
> The governor went away at about eleven o'clock, leaving eight of the

> 
> But I proceeded forth, passing Governor Ford and his escort, and I

> 
> About midnight at a steamboat came down the river, and I went on board

> And when I was there I heard his party admit and praise the

> 
> Each in his turn, the thousands made their way forward, sad and

> Monday 24th--Eventfull day\! found hundreds gathered before the
> Mansion House early in the morning:--in their midst with head erect
> towering above the rest the Prophet stood gazing alternately on the
> devoted City and its much loved citizens; in suspense he listened to
> the entreaties of the throng, not to give himself up or he would be
> murdered; a few, tho' enough, brave hearted men proposed to escort him
> where he would find the protection denied him by the "Christians"
> among the red "pagans" of the West:--others, up north would have him
> go, while a fearless Tar, inured to other climes, whose heart was a
> Malstrom of fury, proffered him a safe passage on a Steam Boat, then
> ready by, to whither he would; a smile of approbation lit up the
> Seer's countenance,--his lively boys hanging on to his skirts urged on
> the suite and cryed "Father, O Father don't go to Carthage they will
> kill you."--a volley of arguments more powerfull yet from the
> streaming eyes of her he loved best, and whose embrace was hard to
> sever; nor least impressive were the pleadings of his doting Mother
> whose grey ringlets honored a head weather-beaten by the persecutions
> of near twice ten years, "My Son, my Son, can you leave me without
> promising to return? Some forty times before have I seen you from me
> dragged, but never before without saying you would return; what say
> you now my Son? He stood erect like a beacon among roaring
> breakers--his gigantic mind grasping still higher; the fire flashed in
> his eye; with hand uplifted on high he spoke "My friends, nay dearer
> still my brethren, I love you, I love the City of Nauvoo too well to
> save my life at your expense,--if I go not to them they will come and
> act out the horrid Missouri scenes in Nauvoo;--I may prevent it, I
> fear not death, my work is well nigh done, keep the faith and I will
> die for Nauvoo. So said the Prophet as he mounted his steed, and
> together with his brother Hyrum and some 30 or 40 more who chose to
> follow, they ascended the hill; when near the sacred spot--the Temple,
> he paused, he looked with admiration first on that, then on the City
> ere it receded from view in the flats below and remarked, this is the
> loveliest place and the best people under the heavens, little do they
> know the trials that await them. While on the prairie we met some
> messengers previously sent to Carthage who had but just been liberated
> from prison. When within 4 miles of Carthage we met a company of
> horseman commanded by Captain Dunn; when they hove in sight Mr. Smith
> halted his "major" (steed) in the midst of the road and said "brethren
> you have come far enough; do notfurther expose your lives, stand
> aloof, let all their vengeance be wreaked upon my head, I am going
> like a lamb to the slaughter with a conscience void of offence. At
> this time Mr. Wood, his Counsell, rode in front of the Company to know
> their intentions and soon returned with an order from the Governor for
> all the State arms which were Nauvoo. When signal of acceptance was
> given they advanced and Mr. Smith addressed them after endorsing the
> order, declaring his innocence of the charges preferred against him
> and demanded of them as an American Citizen to defend his life until
> he should have an investigation, to which Capt. Dunn reply'd that he
> would protect him at the risk of his own life, then turning to his men
> asked "What say you, boys, will you stand by me to see Mr. Smith have
> justice?" The response was by three cheers; and we all returned to
> Nauvoo, got all the arms, and in the evening the Company returned and
> arrived at Carthage late at night failing to get a horse I remained in
> the City.
> 
> 25th-Documents of importance for the trial being in Mrs. Smith's
> possession, by request I took them out to Carthage and arrived during
> the trial of Mr. Smith and the City Council and in time to give in my
> evidence, which was admitted to be not the least important in their
> favour. There I heard Wilson Law, in endeavoring to get a warrant
> against Mr. Smith for Treason, declare that in preaching from Daniel
> II, 44, Smith had said that the kingdom referred to therein was
> already set up, and that he (Mr. Smith) was the King over it\! Wonder
> if Daniel himself was not most treasonable for predicting it? The
> defendants having given bail to appear at the quarter sessions were
> released and returned to Nauvoo; but before Mr. Smith could leave I
> went down stairs in Hamiltons Hotel where I overheard the leaders of
> the mob say that they did not expect to prove anything against him,
> but that they had eighteen accusations against him, and that as one
> failed they would try another to detail him there. One of them, by the
> name of Jackson, reply'd when I told them to desist from their cruel
> persecutions that they had worked too hard to get old Joe to Carthage
> to let him get out of it alive, and pointing to his pistols said, "The
> balls are in there that will decide his case." I repaired upstairs and
> informed Mr. Smith what threats I had heard, when he informed me "They
> are going to take me to prison without a guard; you will not leave me
> will you?" to which I reply'd that I had come to die with him the
> rather. He took me aside into the front room and asked "Have you
> anything with you?" One little bulldog I reply'd, and this switch,
> pointing to a black hickory club in my hand, the which parryed the
> rifles of the assassins in prison by Mr. Taylor. Let me have the first
> said he, which was no sooner said than safely deposited where I wished
> a dozen more to be. Now the rush of heavy treads up the stairs drew
> out attention and the stentorian voice of an officer demanding the
> prisoners, when Dr. Willard Richards met him in the door which was
> actually too narrow for any but himself to pass. Mr. Reid, their
> Counsell, also Mr. Taylor, Hyrum Smith, Judge Phelps, Col. Markam and
> all remonstrated against such an unnecessary exposition of the
> defendant lives until they desisted. It was then that Justice Smith
> made out a mittimus, and the "Carthage Grays" escorted them to prison.
> Being dark, Mr. Smith asked me to get inside somehow, and Col. Markam
> on one side, with a hickory club, while I was on the other, outside
> the guard, I parry'd off the guns and bayonets of the drunken rabble
> who tried to break the ranks to stab them; the prison doors being open
> before a light was produced I rushed between the guard and the door
> and forced my way into the farthest cells unhindered, followed by the
> defendants and the above named, except Judge Phelps, who remained (I
> think) at Hamiltons; Mr. Reid also, but some few other bretheren were
> with us with whom I was not personally acquainted until then; but it
> will be a long time ere I forget
> 
> The first night in Carthage cells with the Prophet and the Patriarch\!
> 
> Amusing conversation on various interesting topics engaged us till
> late; after prayer, which made Carthage prison into the gate of heaven
> for awhile, we lay promiscuously on the floor, the last words spoken
> were, by the Prophet,--"For the most intelligent dream tonight
> bretheren;" and the first words spoken next morning were by him also
> enquiring for the same. None, save one were told which was listened to
> by all as follows--"Portrayed before my mind was Gov. Ford and troops
> on their way across the prairie to Nauvoo, the prisoners had plead in
> vain to return with him, although promised by him to go; with a letter
> of importance I saw myself driven from Carthage, galloping through the
> masses of medley soldiers, half Indians and semi barbarians, I hurried
> across the prairie, had gone downon a boat from Nauvoo towards Quincy,
> but landed at Warsaw awoke, in midst of powder, smoke, death, and
> carnage." The Prophet reply'd it was ominous of future events not did
> he believe the Governor would ever take him to Nauvoo alive.
> 
> After breakfast we were removed to an upstairs room the entrance to
> which was up a flight of stairs from the front prison door, which was
> guarded by soldiers, by alternate four hours; the door was of pine,
> common batton, without bolts, lock, or even a latch that would shut;
> on the south side were two large windows, and one on the East, a tier
> of cells lead from the North, while the entrance was at the N. West
> corner. Its furniture consisted of a bedstead, chair or two, and some
> mattresses.
> 
> During the forenoon we were visited by Judge Phelps, J.P .Green, J.S.
> Fullmore, and C. H. Wheelock, the last I think brought a revolver in
> his boot, and left it with the prisoners when he retired; most of my
> forenoon's work consisted in hewing, with my penknife, a wharped door
> to get it on the latch, and in preparing to fortify against a night
> attack, in which Col. Markam was also industrious. The Prophet
> appeared extremely anxious by his injunction to the messengers who
> left for Nauvoo, among whom were Dr. Brenhisel, I think, to send out
> testimonies to exonerate his brother Hyrum. A portion of us were
> alternately preaching to the guards, at which the Prophet, Patriarch
> and all took turns and several were relieved before their time was out
> because they admitted they were proselyted to the belief of the
> innocency of the prisoners, which rendered them incompetent of
> guarding\! Frequently they admitted they had been imposed upon by the
> tales of the mobs, and more than once was it heard "Let us go home
> boys for I will not fight against these men." Hyrum showed an ardent
> devotion to the Prophet, every way encourageing him to believe that
> the Lord for His Church's sake would release him to their service,
> while Joseph reply'd, "Could my brother Hyrum be but liberated it
> would not matter so much about me; poor Rigdon, I am glad he has gone
> to Pittsburgh out of the way, were he to preside, in less than five
> years he would lead the Church to destruction." He entertained us much
> by the recital of two dreams the which he had received not long
> before, one in which he saw himself pitched into a dry well by Wm. and
> Wilson Law who had previously tied his hands behind him; while
> struggling to get up and near the top he discovered Wilson tackled by
> a ferocious wild beast in an adjoining wood, crying for his help while
> nearer to him still was William with outstretched tongue; blue in the
> face, and the green poison forced out of his mouth by the coiling of a
> huge serpent around his body, relaxing its embrace occasionally and
> thereby enabling him to cry aloud "Oh brother Joseph come and save me
> or I die." To which he reply'd as he had done to a similiar request
> from his brother Wilson, "I cannot, for you have tied my hands behind
> me." Ere long however his guide finding him there released and
> comforted the Prophet while the others met the just retribution of
> their demerit.
> 
> Another time he had seen himself on a lee shore in a heavy storm
> saving a ship from wrecking by wadeing through the foaming surf and
> leading her out to the open sea; again the reckless mariners on board
> rushed into dangerous breakers in despite of his commands from on
> shore to them to beat off to sea. Again he stemmed the raging seas,
> now and anon overwhelmed in the foam, with a mighty effort he sprang
> to the surface, the raging elements hushed at his command, and as on a
> sea of glass he marched with the patriarch by his side until in the
> offing he recognized his brother Samuel, light as a fairy, skipping
> o'er the main;--but the sequel forgotten by me may be remembered by
> others; the interpretation he gave, I believe, was the stranding of
> the great ship "Uncle Sam" owing to rejecting a safe Pilot. Their
> walking on the tranquil ocean donated their triumphs beyond the vail,
> Samuel's sudden exit after his bretheren solves the only mystery which
> the Prophet did not unravel, but sure it is that he gave frequent
> intimations that he would soon gain his liberty, and soar on high
> beyond the "rage of mobs and angry strife."
> 
> Governor Ford and the prisoners Counsell visited them, and at the
> close of a lengthy appeal from the Prophet, in which he denied the
> charges preferred against him, and plead for the protection of his
> life from mob violence until he could prove himself so, which appeared
> to make but little impression upon His Excellency beyond a verbal
> promise that he should have justice, and that his friends present,
> agreeably to his request should visit him, His Excellency promised to
> take them with him to Nauvoo, which promise he afterwards recalled
> through fear of the mobs. Dr. Richards was busily engaged writing as
> dictated by the Prophet. Elder Taylor amused him by singing \&c.

> About the middle of the afternoon the Sheriff came to take the
> prisoners to the Courthouse to be tried, Followed by drunken mobs
> armed and threatening; an altercation ensued between him and the
> Prison Keeper, because, as was proved by the mittimus to the latter

> was the best protection from the levelled rifles of the surrounding
> bush hiders, Col. Markam on one side, myself on the other, with our
> "switchers" parry'd off the crowding rabble, and after ascending no
> the Court House much exertion was made by the mob to proceed forthwith
> with trial without letting the defendant have their witnesses, and as
> soon as they were overruled, and the trial postponed until next day,
> the only Justice in the place, the Smith before spoken of, who could
> grant subpeonas for witnesses, absconded until a late hour, as it
> purposely to prevent the appearing of the defendants witnesses, and in
> keeping with the conviction expressed by them the previous day "That
> the law cannot touch him, but that powder and ball will." In the
> evening they were again escorted to the prison amidst the whooping,
> hallooing and denunciations of enfuriated thousands; while some
> tauntingly upbraided him for not calling a legion of angels to release
> him, and to destroy his enemies, inasmuch as he pretended to have a
> miraculous power; others asked him to prophesy when and what manner of
> death awaited him, professing themselves to know all about it; in fact
> one was forcibly reminded of the taunting and jeering of the Jews to
> our holy and meek Redeemer, so similar did their words and actions
> prove their spirits to be.
> 
> During the evening the Patriarch read and commented upon copious
> extracts from the Book of Mormon, the imprisonments and deliverance of
> the servants of God for the Gospels sake; Joseph bore a powerful
> testimony to the guards of the divine authenticity of the Book of
> Mormon--the restoration of the Gospel, the administration of angels,
> and that the Kingdom of God was again upon the Earth, for the sake of
> which he was at that time incarcerated in that prison, and not because
> he had violated any law of God or of man.
> 
> Late, we retired to rest, Joseph and Hyrum on the only bedstead while
> 4 or 5 lay side by side on mattresses on the floor, Dr. Richards
> sitting up writing until his last candle left him in the dark; the
> report of a gun, fired close by, caused Joseph whose head was by a

> embrace; soon after Dr. Richards retired to the bed and while I
> thought all but myself and heaven asleep, Joseph asked in a whisper of

> cause I do not think that death would have many terrors," I replied.
> "You will see Wales and fulfill the mission appointed you ere you die"
> he said. I believed his word and relied upon it through trying scenes
> which followed. All the conversation evinced a presentiment of an
> approaching crisis. At midnight I was awoke by heavy treads as of
> soldiery close by, and I heard a whispering "Who, and how many shall
> go in?" under our window; upon arising I saw a large number of men in
> front of the prison, and gave the alarm as they rushed up stairs to
> our room door; we had taken the precaution to fortify ourselves by
> placing a chair, the only defence, against the door, which one of the
> brethren seized for a weapon, and we stood by the door awaiting their
> entrance; hearing us they hesitated; when the Prophet with a "Prophets
> voice" called out" Come on ye assassins we are ready for you, and
> would as willing die now as at daylight." Hearing this they retired
> again, and consulted, advanced and retreated alternately, evidently
> failing to agree, until the assassins terror--the morning light,
> chased the murderers with their kindred fiends and the darkness to the
> abodes where the reveller in crime was the hero of the day.
> 
> Early in the morning of the 27th June, eventful day\! A day ever to be
> remembered\! The Prophet requested me to descend and interrogate the
> guard as to the cause of the intrusion upon us in the night, in doing
> which I was replied by the sergeant, whose name was Worrell, I think,
> of the Carthage Grays, in a very better spirit that "We have had too
> much trouble to bring old Joe here to let him ever escape out alive,
> and unless you want to die with him you better leave before sundown,
> and you are not a d-n bit better than him for taking his part." I
> endeavored to cool him down and to recall those threats which so ill
> became those who were entrusted with the lives of men, but he insisted
> the more "You'll see that I can prophesy better than old Joe that
> neither he nor his brother nor anyone who will remain with them will
> see the sun set today." With such threats did the Sergeant, in
> presence of his men, declaim against the prisoners: and one of them
> levelled and cocked his rifle at me, swearing with an awfull
> imprecation how he "would love to bore a hole through old Joe." Joseph
> and Hyrum were all this time listening unobservedly at the head of the
> stairs to all that was said, and on my return desired me to go and
> inform Governor Ford of all that I had heard.
> 
> While going to his Excellency's quarters I saw an assemblage of people
> and met Col. Markham who was out of the gaol before me; I listened to
> what they had to say and beheld one of the mobocrats addressing the
> crowd saying hat they would make a sham discharge in obedience to

> in the forenoon, "Then we will return to town boys and tear that
> prison down and have those two men's lives before sundown," which
> declaration was not uttered in a whisper nor in a corner, but at the
> top of his voice, which echoed in the walls of the Town Hall and
> public square, and which was responded to by the loud three cheers of
> the crowd as eagerly as \[crease has worn away the words\] another
> barrel of whiskey was called into their midst to the eternal disgrace
> of the name of sectarianism be it remarked. Accompanied by, whether
> Col. Markam, J.P. Green or J.S. Fullmore or who I do not remember, I
> went to His Excellency's apartment in Hamilton's Hotel, where I found
> several Officers with him in conversation; in their presence I
> informed him of the threats made against the lives of the prisoners,
> offering to produce further proof if necessary; to which he at length
> reply'd "You are unnecessarily alarmed for your friends safety Sir,
> the people are not that cruel." Irritated by such a remark I urged the
> necessity of placing better men than professed assassins to guard
> them; that they were American Citizens surrendered to his "pledged
> honour"; that they were also Master Masons, and as such I demanded the
> protection of their lives; when this appeal failed to reach his
> adamantine heart, whose face appeared to be pale with fright or
> horror, I remarked that I had then but one request to make if he left
> their lives in the hands of those men to be sacrificed. "What is that
> sir?" he asked in a hurried tone. "It is that the Almighty will
> preserve my life to a proper time and place to testify that you have
> been timely warned of their danger." All this produced no other
> visible effect than to turn him round and stroll to the other end of
> the room. I returned to the prison, and sought to enter, but would not
> be let in by the guard. I again returned to the Hotel when his
> Excellency was standing in front of the Mac Donough troops in line,
> ready to escort him to Nauvoo, the disbanded mob, retiring to their
> rear at the time, shouted loud in his hearing that they were going
> only a short distance out of town and would return and hang old Joe
> and Hyrum as soon as the Governor would be gone out of the way. I
> begged to call his attention there and then to their own threats which
> he could hardly fail to hear as well as myself \[creased and worn
> line\] for myself and friends to be in prison according to his promise
> to the prisoners when he declined giving any, but told Col. Demming to
> give me one to take to Dr. Richards the secretary, by obtaining which
> I was near being massacred, and was told by Chauncey Higbee on the
> street that they "were determined to kill Joe and Hyrum and that I had
> better go away to save myself." I was then alone in the midst of the
> turbulent mob with whom I contended for the innocency of the
> prisoners, and for their right of trial, until enraged, they attempted
> to seize me, but I eluded their grasp. Meeting Mr. A.W. Babbit in the
> street I informed him that Mr. Smith wished to see him, whither he
> went with me; he was admitted as Counsel. I tried to get in by means
> of Dr. Richards' pass, in my hand, but in vain; Joseph, Hyrum,--all
> endeavoured to get me in but failed; I however informed Dr. Richards
> who was allowed to come outside, of the threats of the mobs, who
> reply'd that they deemed my life in imminent danger in the midst of
> the mob. I was handed a letter from Mr. Smith, with a request to take
> it to Mr. Browning of Quincy forthwith; the guard aware of the letter
> informed the mob "that Joe had sent orders to raise the Nauvoo Legion
> to rescue him," drew the mob around me, and they demanded the letter,
> which I utterly refused to give up to them; when some would take it by
> force others objected; the mob disagreed among themselves while some
> said I should not leave the place alive, others swore that I should
> not stay longer there; at this the former party said if I left then I
> should not reach Nauvoo alive, and about a dozen started off with in
> hand to waylay me where the road runs through the woods. Having
> previously ordered my horse which was already in the street, I took
> advantage of their disagreement and no sooner in the saddle than both
> spurs were to work, and a racehorse and rider were enveloped in a
> cloud of dust with balls whistling nor saw the second scene until
> beyond the point of timber stretching into the prairie half a mile; to
> my right I discovered the road to Nauvoo, and the Gov. and escort
> about 4 miles off having dined there; proving that I was on the
> Carthage road, my horse having like myself, lost the waylaid road
> leading through the woods, and thereby escaped those awaiting me
> there. I turned across the plain to the order road, and passed the
> Governor, whereas, as was ascertained afterwards, had I advanced half
> a mile farther on the Carthage road, I should have come upon a gang of
> about 300 painted assassins who were then beyond a prairie ridge on
> that road waiting the disappearing of His Excellency in order to march
> upon the prison and execute the horrid threats. Thus I was
> providentially led as if between two fires unharmed. While tediously
> traversing the sea of grass which separated Nauvoo from Carthage, tho'
> under all the pressure my craft could carry, my dream in the prison
> came fresh to view, and this for the fulfillment of it;--the letter
> actually in my possession,--the troops in full view, myself going to
> Quincy filled my soul with ominous forebodings of the sequel, so that
> having left the troops far behind, arriving in the edge of the City I
> entreated of the crowds who had assembled to meet His Excellency to
> haste to Carthage and save the Prophet's life--the only alternative.
> But wiser ones, perhaps, had otherwise decreed, and I with thousands
> more had the mortification of seeing, formally, greeted within the
> mourning "City of Joseph" the "Pilate" that should have changed places
> and doom; had the untold disgrace I say of listening to a man stuck up
> in front of the Prophet's house, and harrangueing an innocent and
> inoffensive people with the insinuations applicable only to his own
> party; anything less than the superhuman endurance of those saints
> would have been tantalized to retaliate, when in presence of the
> wives, children, and friends of his victims he declared that "a great
> crime had been done by placing the City under Martial Law, \[which was
> done only so far as self preservation from the mobs was demanding,\]
> and a sever atonement must be made; so prepare your minds for the
> emergency." So awful a threat proceeding from the lips of the highest
> functionary of a State, while the victims had surrendered themselves
> as pledges of his "honour", drew from bursting hearts of many
> bystanders a half stifled shriek of horror as it echoed in the walls
> of the Prophet's house and drew louder shrieks from his wife and
> mother who later sank into her chair crying "My sons O my sons' lives
> are means to make the atonement." Even the obdurate spirit of the
> speaker felt the shock; and appeared to quiver from the effects of his
> own denunciations, from which he could not recoil. But I forbear to
> advert to that memorable oration\! After which he and his escort were
> entertained at the Mansion House, and while sitting at the Prophet's
> table the hands of the assassins were dripping with his blood, and His
> Excellency might have said "A severe atonement has been made," as
> doubtless the Prophet and Patriarch were weltering in their own
> atoneing blood while their doom was being proclaimed to their families
> and friends.
> 
> Late that night I boarded a steamer bound to St. Louis, and landed at
> Warsaw after midnight, seeing a great excitement on the landing I
> stepped among them when I heard a mobocrat stating that "Joe and Hyrum
> were both shot while trying to escape from prison,"--He said that they
> had sent messengers to Quincy and the lower Counties to raise the
> Militia to defend Warsaw against an attack from the Mormons: but that
> "their real object was, when they got them there, to take the beauty
> and booty of Nauvoo." One, in order to stimulate the others, said, "I
> know where a chest full of gold is hid in old Joe's cellar." The
> general feeling manifested there was of rejoicing at the crime
> committed, and of exulting in the horrid act shedding innocent blood,
> which reminded me of the sequel of my dream; altho' I hoped against
> hope that they boasted of their desires, rather than of overt acts.
> Then I got hold of a "Warsaw signal Extra," a slit of paper a little
> larger than my hand, was just issued, containing nothing but the news
> of the massacre; commencing by putting the letter J for Joe upside
> down; it stated "that the Mormons attacked the prison;--that the

> Hancock were shot by Joe;-- the Mormons have killed Governor Ford--and
> suite, burned Carthage; and we look for them to attack Warsaw every
> hour; will not the inhabitants of the surrounding Country rush to our
> defence before we, our wives and children will be massacreed." In
> order to dupe the public to believe this tissue of falsehood, without
> even a shadow of truth in one statement of it, to my positive
> knowledge, they had sent a number of women and children in their night
> clothes on a previous down Steamer to Quincy, merely to raise their

John Hay, “The Mormon Prophet’s Tragedy,” *Atlantic Monthly* (December
1869): 669-78. (The author’s dad, Charles Hay, was a physician for the
militia, as mentioned in the article.)

> On the morning of the 27th June, the regiment of Colonel Levi Williams
> started from Warsaw, in obedience to the call of the governor to
> rendezvous at Golden's Point, a settlement in the vicinity of Nauvoo.
> They went out in high glee, fully expecting to march to the city of
> the Saints, and not doubting that before they left it some occasion
> would arise which would make it necessary to remove this standing
> scandal from the face of the earth. There were none but words of law
> and order on their lips; but every man clearly understood that Nauvoo
> was to be destroyed before they returned. A public meeting in Warsaw
> had unanimously "Resolved, that we will forthwith proceed to Nauvoo
> and exterminate the city and its people"; a manifesto which seemed too
> peppery even for the palate of Mr. Sharp, editor of the "Signal," who,
> when he published it, added the saving clause, "if necessary." "Of
> course it will be necessary," said these law-abiding militia-men as
> they marched out of Warsaw on the Nauvoo road.
> 
> Order reigned in Warsaw — for the men were all gone. The whole male
> adult population, with trifling exceptions, were in Williams's
> regiment. Among the captains were William N. Grover, afterwards a
> distinguished lawyer of St. Louis, and United States Attorney for
> Missouri, — an eminently respectable and conservative man; Thomas C.
> Sharp, editor of the "Signal," who also on this day sowed the last of
> his wild oats, and was afterwards principal of the public school, and
> greatly esteemed as county judge; Jacob C. Davis, then State senator,
> afterwards member of Congress from that district.
> 
> They arrived near noon at some deserted shanties, about seven miles
> from Warsaw, that had been built and abandoned in that flurry and
> collapse of internal improvements that passed over the State in 1838.
> There they were met by Mr. David Matthews, a well-known citizen of
> Warsaw, who had ridden rapidly from Carthage with an order from the
> governor, disbanding the regiment. The governor, fearing he could not
> control the inflammable material he had gathered together, had
> determined to scatter it again.
> 
> Colonel Williams read the governor's order. Some of the anti-Mormon
> warriors, blessed with robust Western appetites, looked at the sun,
> and concluded they could get home by dinnertime, and under the
> influence of this inspiring idea started off at quick step. Captain
> Grover soon found himself without a company. Captain Aldrich essayed a
> speech calling for volunteers for Carthage. "He did not make a fair
> start," says the chronicle, "and Sharp came up and took it off his
> hands." Sharp, being a spirited and impressive talker, soon had a
> respectable squad about him. Captain Davis, on the contrary, was
> sorely perplexed. It was heavy weather for him. He was a professional
> politician, and clearly loved both Mormon and anti-Mormon votes. He
> was so backward in coming forward that his company left him in
> disgust, and followed the fiery Grover, whose company had gone home to
> dinner. Davis still could not make up his mind to go home, but "got
> into Calvin Cole's wagon and followed the boys at a distance"; so that
> he had at last the luck to be in at the closing scene, and the honor
> to be indicted with the rest. The speeches of Grover and Sharp were
> rather vague; the purpose of murder does not seem to have been hinted.
> They protested against "being made the tools and puppets of Tommy
> Ford." They were going to Carthage to see the boys, and talk things
> over. Some of the cooler heads, such as Dr. Hay, surgeon of the
> regiment, denounced the proceeding and went at once back to Warsaw.
> 
> While they were waiting at the shanties, a courier came in from the
> Carthage Grays. It is impossible at this day to declare exactly the
> purport of his message. It is usually reported and believed that he
> brought an assurance from the officers of this company that they would
> be found on guard at the jail where the Smiths were confined; that
> they would make no real resistance, — merely enough to save
> appearances.
> 
> This message was not communicated to the men. They followed their
> leaders off on the road to Carthage, with rather vague intentions.
> They were annoyed at the prospect of their picnic coming so readily to
> a close, at losing the fun of sacking Nauvoo, at having to go home
> without material for a single romance. Nearly one hundred and fifty
> started with their captains, but they gradually dwindled in number to
> seventy-five. These trudged along under the fierce summer sun of the
> prairies towards the town where the cause of all the trouble and
> confusion of the last few years awaited them. They sang on the way a
> rude parody of a camp-meeting hymn called in the West the "Hebrew
> Children":—
> 
> "Where now is the Prophet Joseph?
> 
> Where now is the Prophet Joseph?
> 
> Where now is the Prophet Joseph?

> Safe in the Carthage Jail\!"
> 
> The farther they walked the more the idea impressed itself upon them
> that now was the time to finish the matter totally. The unavowed
> design of the leaders communicated itself magnetically to the men,
> until the entire. company became fused into one mass of bloodthirsty
> energy. By an excess of precaution, they did not go directly, into the
> town, but made a long detour, so as to come in by the road leading
> from Nauvoo.
> 
> The jail where the Smiths were confined is situated at the extreme
> northwestern edge of the dismal village, at the end of a long,
> ill-kept street whose middle is a dusty road and whose sides are gay
> with stramonium and dog-fennel. As the avengers came in sight of the
> mean-looking building that held their prey, the sleeping tiger that
> lurks in every human heart sprang up in theirs, and they quickened
> their pace to a run. There was no need of orders, — no possibility of
> checking them now. The guards were hustled away from the door,
> good-naturedly resisting until they were carefully disarmed. Their
> commander, Lieutenant Frank Worrell, afterwards gave this testimony on
> the trial, which we copy for its curious and cynical bonhomie:—
> 
> "I was one of the guards at the jail. Saw Smith when he was killed.
> Saw none of the defendants at the jail. Suppose there were one or two
> hundred there. They stayed three or four minutes. They formed in front
> of the jail and made a rush. Knew none that came up..... Heard nothing
> that was said..... Saw Smith die, — was within ten feet of him.....
> Perhaps a minute after he fell I saw him die..... I was pushed and
> shoved some fifty feet..... Did not see Sharp, Grover, or Davis. It
> was so crowded I could not see much. I know about one third of the men
> in the county, but none at the jail. I might have been some scared."
> 
> It would be difficult to imagine anything cooler than this quiet
> perjury to screen a murder. Yet the strangest part of this strange
> story is that Frank Worrell was a generous young fellow, and the men
> with whom he carried out the ghastly comedy of attack and resistance
> at the door of the prison — Sharp and Grover — were good citizens,
> educated and irreproachable, who still live to enjoy the respect and
> esteem of all who know them. There is but one force mighty enough in
> the world to twist such minds and consciences so fearfully awry; and
> that is the wild suspicion bred of civil strife. A few months of this
> miniature war in Hancock County had sufficed to possess many of the
> prominent actors with the spirit of demons; and in the mind of any
> anti-Mormon there was nothing more criminal in the shooting of Smith
> than in the slaying of a wolf or panther.
> 
> This jolly, good-natured Worrell was himself murdered by Mormon
> assassins not long after. He was riding with a friend. A shot was
> heard from a thicket. "That was a rifle\!" said the friend. "Yes, and
> I 've got it," said Worrell, coolly. He fell from his horse and died.
> I have seen, as a child, his grave at Warsaw. A rude wooden
> head-board, bearing this legend, "He who is without enemies is
> unworthy of friends," — not very orthodox, but perhaps as true as most
> epitaphs.
> 
> While Worrell, little thinking of his tombstone, was struggling with
> his friendly assailants, as many as the narrow entry would hold had
> rushed into the open door and up the cramped little stairs. Smith and
> his brother had been that day removed from their cells and given
> comparative liberty in a large airy room on the first floor above.
> This afternoon they were receiving the visits of two Mormon brethren,
> Richards and Taylor. They heard the row at the door and the rush on
> the stairs, and instinctively barred their door by pressing their
> weight against it. The mob fired at the door. Hiram Smith fell,
> exclaiming, "I'm a dead man." Taylor crawled under the bed, with a
> bullet in the calf of his leg. Richards hid himself behind the opening
> door, in mortal terror. He afterwards lied terribly about the affair,
> saying he stood calmly in the centre of the room, warding off the
> bullets with a consecrated wand.
> 
> Joe Smith died bravely. He stood by the jamb of the door and fired
> four shots, bringing his man down every time. He shot an Irishman
> named Wills, who was in the affair from his congenital love of a
> brawl, in the arm; Gallagher, a Southerner from the Mississippi
> Bottom, in the face; Voorhees, a half-grown hobbledehoy from Bear
> Creek, in the shoulder; and another gentleman, whose name I will not
> mention, as he is prepared to prove an alibi, and besides stands six
> feet two in his moccasins.
> 
> Smith had two loaded six-barrelled revolvers in his room. How a man on
> trial for capital offences came to be supplied with such luxuries is a
> mystery that perhaps only one man could fully have solved; and as
> General Deming, the Jack-Mormon sheriff, died soon after, and left no
> explanation of the matter, investigation is effectually baffled. But
> the four shots which I have chronicled, and two which had no billet,
> exhausted one pistol, and the enemy gave Smith no time to use the

> open to receive the fresh June air, and half leaped, half fell, into
> the jail yard below. With his last dying energies he gathered himself
> up, and leaned in a sitting posture against the rude stone well-curb.
> His stricken condition, his vague wandering glances, excited no pity
> in the mob thirsting for his life. They had not seen the handsome

> regions). A squad of Missourians who were standing by the fence
> levelled their pieces at him, and, before they could see him again for
> the smoke they made, Joe Smith was dead.

> Meanwhile, the Carthage Grays were approaching. They had been called
> out half an hour before, and formed on the Court-House Square, by
> Captain Robert Smith, with great precision and a deliberation that

> became in the great war General Robert F. Smith, and marched his
> troops from Hancock County to the Atlantic with more speed, if less
> science, than he displayed in leading his squad that day from the
> Court-House to the jail.
> 
> The moment the work was done, the calmness of horror succeeded the

> through the main street of Warsaw, — at such an astounding rate of
> speed had the lash of their own thoughts driven them.
> 
> The town was instantly put in such attitude of defence as its limited

> 
> "The St. Louis 'Gazette' says that the men that killed the Smiths were
> a pack of cowards. Now our view of the matter is, that instead of
> cowardice they exhibited foolhardy courage, for they must have known

> Governor Thomas Ford was here in command. The Smiths had surrendered

> the troops to return home and disband except two compa­nies, which he

> as vet fully learned the lesson of red tape and complete obedience to
> all orders. Still, in the company I had the name of doing quite well
> for a boy.
> 
> A little after 7:00 A.M. the troops broke camp and left for home. The
> Gover­nor, with his escort started for Nauvoo, and the Smiths were
> taken to the jail­- there kept under guard by a detail of six men from
> the company, with an officer in command; the company remaining in camp
> at the public square. About 11 o'clock A.M., myself and another young
> man were ordered by the captain to go on top of the court house and
> keep a sharp lookout for and see if a body of men were approaching the
> town from any direction; and, if any were seen, to immediately report
> to the captain personally, at his quarters. We had a large field glass
> and could clearly see in every direction save due north for several
> miles. We were espe­cially ordered to keep a strict outlook over the
> prairies towards Nauvoo. Nothing suspicious was discovered until about
> 4 P.M. when we saw a body of armed men in wagons and on horses
> approaching the low timber, a little north of west from the jail, and
> about two miles distant. This was at once reported to the captain,
> when we were ordered to keep a strict watch and at once report if they
> came through the timber. In about a half hour after, a body of armed
> men- about 125- came out of the woods on foot and started in a single
> file, behind an old rail fence, in the direction of the jail. They
> were then about three-fourths of a mile distant. This we at once
> attempted to report, but could not find the captain; and (not being
> "muz­zled," as soldiers of late date) told another officer, who after
> considerable delay found the captain who ordered the company to fall
> into line. By this time the mob had reached the jail and had commenced
> shooting. I there forgot all about orders to put on accoutrements and
> fall into line; but immediately started on dou­ble quick for the jail.

> To digress: For one of the best drilled and equipped companies in the
> state at that time- on that occasion we would have taken the prize for
> the best exhibi­tion of an awkward squad in existence. I have always
> thought the officers and some privates were working for delay. The
> company finally reached the jail, but not until after the mob had
> completed their work and left in the direction from which they came.
> When about fifty yards away I saw Joseph Smith come to the window and
> fall out. One of the men went to him and partially straightened his
> body out beside the well curb. Just at this time I got up amongst the
> men and heard him say, "he's dead," when all the mob immediately left.
> I went to where Smith was lying and found that he was dead without

> I found Hyrum Smith lying upon the floor on his back, dead. No person
> was in the room, or came while I was there. He was stretched out on
> the floor, just as he had fallen after being shot.
> 
> The shot that killed him was fired through the door panel by one of
> the mob, while in the hall, and struck him in the left breast, he
> falling backward. There were in the room at that time four persons-
> the two Smiths and Elders Taylor and Richards. Taylor was wounded,
> being hit several times- all flesh wounds-­ and was the same night
> taken to my father's house, where he was cared for until able to be
> taken to Nauvoo. Richards was not hurt and immediately after the mob
> left the hall, carried Taylor into the cell department of the jail,
> which was done just before I went upstairs. The room in which they

> the front or south end, and the door opening from the hall, just at
> the top of the stairs almost directly opposite the east side window
> out of which Smith fell. There was a bedstead in the south­east corner
> of the room, under which Taylor was after the shooting was over. The
> door opened in such a manner that when forced open it formed a recess
> in the corner, so that a person there was hid from sight. Richard's
> position bought \[sic\] him into the corner. There was no lock, bolt
> or even latch upon the door, and when the mob started upstairs, those
> in the room shut the door and attempted to hold it. After those in the
> hall had tried several times to push it open, Smith hav­ing shot at
> them by putting the muzzle of his old English pepperbox revolver
> through the opening at the side of the door (made by their efforts)
> and firing four shots into the hall, one of the men placed the muzzle
> of his rifle against the door and fired, which shot killed Hyrum
> Smith, he being behind the panel in a posi­tion to do most of the work
> in keeping the door shut, he falling backward, leav­ing the door which
> flew open and hid Richards in the corner. At the same time others in
> the hall fired into the room, wounding Taylor, who rolled under the
> bed. Smith, in attempting to escape out of the window was shot from
> the outside falling outward.
> 
> The approach of the mob was made from the rear or north, dividing part
> to the east and west, meeting at the front, thus completely
> surrounding the jail. The guards were quietly sitting in front and in
> the hall below, all of whom were cap­tured without much trouble or
> danger. Just a little suspicion might be attached to the officer in
> command. Yet it might be presumed he thought his only duty was to keep
> the Smiths from coming downstairs. After I had satisfied my curiosity,
> seen and been among the mob, seen the prophet shot, and seen the dead

William Daniels, *Nauvoo Neighbor* (May 7 and May 14, 1845 issues). (The
account below contains several embellishments or fantasies that are
contradicted by other witnesses. For example, Daniels has Joseph Smith
surviving his fall from the second story jail and then being shot by
four men under the orders of Levi Williams. After the murder of Smith,
Daniels describes a scene in which a "ruffian" draws a bowie knife and
is ready to sever the head of Smith when suddenly a pillar of light
"bursts from the heavens upon the bloody scene" and frightens the
killers away.)

> 
> To fully present this phase of the cruel butchery, the following
> statements of an eye-witness are introduced. It is an account given by
> Wm. M. Daniels, which was written out carefully by the author of this
> volume and printed in a pamphlet, at Nauvoo.
> 
> Mr. Daniels, for some time after the murder, resided in Nauvoo, where
> he joined the Church. In justice to him it should be here stated that
> he evinced the fullest sincerity while relating the incidents of his
> narrative. As regards the flash of light described by him, which is
> illustrated in our engraving, he averred most emphatically that it
> occurred as related. Even before the court, when the murderers were
> arraigned for examination as to their complicity in the bloody deed,
> he was confronted by the lawyers for the mob party, and there stated
> that all he had told was the truth.
> 
> As to the correctness of this strange exhibition of light, the author
> knows nothing personally; but it is given as Daniels’ testimony, among
> the other incidents, and he leaves the reader to draw such conclusions
> as may seem reasonable.
> 
> The whereabouts of Mr. Daniels has been unknown to the writer since
> 1846. It is not at all unlikely that some of the parties implicated in
> the tragedy at Carthage assassinated him for exposing them. They swore
> they would do so, and were hunting for him previous to the exodus of
> the Saints from Nauvoo. On the steamboat Ocean Wave a party of them
> tried to get some information, as to where Daniels might be found,
> from, and also laid a cunning plan to entrap, the writer when the boat
> should land at Warsaw, for the part he took in the publication—but
> they failed.
> 
> The following is the statement of Daniels:
> 
> I resided in Augusta, Hancock County, Ill., eighteen miles from
> Carthage. On the 16th day of June, I left my home with the intention
> of going to St. Louis. When I arrived at Bear Creek, I found the
> country in a great state of excitement, in relation to the “Mormons.”
> I was told it would be dangerous for me to proceed farther on my way
> to Warsaw, as the intermediate country was mostly settled by
> “Mormons,” who would, in all probability, intercept me by
> violence. I knew nothing of the character and disposition of the
> “Mormon” people, never having been personally acquainted with them
> as a community. The tales of villainy that were related concerning
> them, were so horrid and shocking that I yielded to the entreaties of
> my advisers, and abandoned, for that day, at least, my intention of
> proceeding farther on my journey. I lodged that night with a Mr.
> Scott.
> 
> The next morning a company of men were going from that place to
> Carthage, for the purpose, as they said, of assisting the militia to
> drive the “Mormons” out of the country. Out of curiosity, as I had no
> particular way to spend my time, and the creeks having been rendered
> impassable that night by heavy rain, I went in company with them to
> Carthage. On our way there, they were discussing the best means to be
> adopted for the expulsion of the “Mormon” population. Some were for
> marching to Nauvoo, and laying the city in ashes, and driving the
> inhabitants from the limits of the State, at the point of the bayonet;
> others were for murdering Joseph and Hyrum Smith, while others were in
> favor of accomplishing both of these barbarous objects.
> 
> I noticed minutely their conversation, and it was not hard for me to
> discover that all their animosity and hatred of their neighbors, arose
> from a spirit of envy. I heard no person declaring that the “Mormons”
> had ever personally injured him; but they swore that “Old Joe” was
> getting too much power and influence in the world, and he ought to be
> put out of the way. His career ought to be stopped. They looked upon
> him as no less than a second Mahomet, who would soon spring into
> power, usurp the reins of government, and establish his religion by
> the sword. To prevent such a calamity from befalling the world, they
> argued that it would be doing God service to take his life, supposing
> that would also totally annihilate the religion called “Mormonism.”
> 
> From that hour I looked upon them as demons, not men, and determined
> to do all in my power to prevent so bloody and awful an occurrence. I
> was not attached to any religious society whatever, and was willing
> that all mankind should worship Almighty God according to the dictates
> of their own consciences. I knew that the laws of my country, which I
> had been taught to honor and revere, granted all men that right and
> privilege, while they were the subjects of its government. I hoped
> that her institutions might be untarnished and her dignity unsullied
> and free from so disgraceful an event as was then in contemplation.
> 
> We arrived in Carthage, and found the Carthage Greys, and several
> other companies, on parade. I was told their object was to drive the
> “Mormons.” I would remark that a certain preacher, professing to be
> a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world, was engaged in
> playing a drum at the head of this company.
> 
> These companies were commanded by Captains Smith, Green and others,
> who were greatly excited, and said they were determined to kill the
> “Mormons.” On hearing that the governor was on his way to Carthage,
> they were very much alarmed; whereupon Joseph H. Jackson, in company
> with Dr. Foster, F.M. Higbee, and others, declared that if the
> Governor, “Tom” Ford, came, and gave the Smiths–Joseph and Hyrum–a
> fair trial, they would be acquitted, and we will be hung as sure as
> there is a God in heaven. Further he observed, “I do not see why the
> d—-d little governor could not stay at home, and send us word, and
> we would do the business up in a hurry, and drive the ‘Mormons’ out of
> the country.”
> 
> I returned to Bear Creek that night, with the intention of leaving for
> St. Louis the next morning. However, on the morning of the 20th,
> hearing that the Governor had arrived at Carthage, and being somewhat
> acquainted with him, I concluded to return and see him, which I did.
> 
> When I arrived at Carthage, he was addressing the people at the Court
> House, in relation to the “Mormon” difficulties. He said he came there
> to see that the law was fully carried out. When he was done, Mr.
> Roosevelt, of Warsaw, went upon the public square, mounted a box, and
> made an inflammatory speech to the people who had collected, wherein
> he stated that the law was not sufficient to carry out their measures.
> Stretching out his arms at full length, he said, with all the energy
> in his power: “We have the willing minds, and God Almighty has given
> us strength, and we will wield the sabre and make our own laws\!\!” He
> then said he presumed that the governor meant well enough, but was too
> easy in his remarks to them, in saying that he wished a compliance
> with the laws.
> 
> Mr. Roosevelt soon gave way for Mr. Skinner, a “young limb of the
> law,” a tool for mobocracy, and, at the time, a candidate for the
> Legislature, who made a short speech, wherein he stated he was one of
> the delegates appointed by the people of Carthage to go to Springfield
> and lay before the governor their grievances. He was not so severe
> upon the governor as Mr. Roosevelt had been. He presumed the governor
> would do what was right, but his ultimate course proved him to be the
> most hypocritical.
> 
> The governor gave orders, which were read by Capt. Dunn, that all the
> people who had been promiscuously assembled in Carthage, should be
> consolidated in the militia, under his command, to co-operative in
> maintaining the supremacy of the law.
> 
> I returned to Bear Creek that evening. In the morning, I proceeded to
> Warsaw. On my arrival there, a force of about three hundred men was
> mustered upon the parade ground under the command of Captains Aldrich
> Grover, Elliott, and Col. Williams of Green Plains. I wished to know
> what their intentions were, and was informed that they were determined
> to drive the d—-d Mormons out of the County. I remained there five
> days; during which time Williams, Roosevelt, Sharp, and others, were
> continually beating up for volunteers, by making inflammatory
> speeches, exciting the populace and making false publications to the
> world. Col. Williams announced that he was empowered by the governor,
> to stop and search steamboats, at the wharf, at Warsaw. Accordingly,
> he stopped the steam packet Osprey. On Capt. Anderson’s refusal to let
> him search the boat, he ordered his men to fire upon her. The cannon
> was leveled upon the boat. As they were in the act of firing, a
> gentlemen who was standing by, being sober (for most of them were
> badly intoxicated) placed his hand between the match and powder, which
> prevented ignition. They, however, searched the boat; but did not
> succeed in finding but eight or nine kegs of powder, which they
> permitted to remain on board. That evening they fired upon two more
> steamboats, with their muskets, which they compelled to stop. Col.
> Williams informed the Captains, that he had orders to search their
> boats for ammunition, arms, provisions, etc. The captains consented,
> and search was instituted, but nothing was found which was considered
> contraband, and the boats resumed their course.
> 
> Relative to the governor’s giving the peopled of Warsaw orders to stop
> and search steamboats, I would remark that Gov. Ford informed me at
> Quincy, that he had not given them orders to stop any boats, with the
> exception of the Maid of Iowa, a boat then owned by the “Mormons,”
> which the people supposed might convey away Gen. Smith. Here we see a
> willful and arbitrary infraction of law and order, on the part of this
> military Nero, Col. Williams, and the mobbers of Warsaw.
> 
> All was commotion and turmoil through Warsaw and its vicinity. The
> scenery had become insipid and irksome to me, and I longed for relief
> and to be where my mind could be at rest. Passing through such
> continual bustle, watching the movements of the rabble who, like a
> horde of impetuous barbarians, seemed impelled on, by the blind
> infatuation of priests and shallow zealots, in hopes of booty,
> disgusted and sickened me and fired me with contempt. My mind reverted
> to the time when the dark and bloody Attila led on the ignorant Huns
> to conquest, plunder and extermination, applying the torch of
> conflagration to pleasant villages and sequestered homes.
> 
> On Tuesday, I started for Quincy. As I pursued my journey from Warsaw,
> my mind was uneasy and restless. When I had traveled near eight miles
> I enquired my way, and, through accident or design, I was placed upon
> a road that led me directly back to Warsaw. My mind was composed and
> tranquil as I came in sight of the place. My attention was attracted
> by a group of men, apparently in earnest conversation. I drew near and
> learned that the Carthage Greys had made them the proposition to come
> to Carthage, on the following day, and assist them in murdering Joseph
> and Hyrum Smith, during the absence of the governor, at Golden’s
> Point, where he contemplated marching with the troops. As soon as they
> discovered that I had learned the purpose of their conference, they
> became suspicious of me, fearing exposure, no doubt, and put me under
> guard. I was held in custody until the following morning when a
> company of volunteers was raised, to march to Golden’s Point, to unite
> with the governor. I desired to make the governor acquainted with what
> was contemplated against the lives of the prisoners. To effect this
> object, I volunteered, and drew a musket. The company was paraded in
> single file; roll was called and Capt. Jacob Davis, (the murderer, who
> was afterward screened from justice by the Senate of Illinois,) and
> Capt. Grover, selected ten men each from their respective companies,
> who were to march to Carthage, in compliance with the request of the
> Carthage Greys to co-operative with them in committing the murder.
> These twenty men were marched a short distance to one side, where they
> received their instructions from Col. Williams, Mark Aldrich, Capt.
> Jacob Davis, and Capt. Grover, and they were sent off. I do not
> recollect the names of any of these twenty, with the exception of two
> brothers—coopers in Warsaw, by the name of Stevens. One of them is
> about six feet three inches high, well proportioned and athletic. The
> other is near five feet nine inches high, with dark complexion and
> dark hair. When the officers were interrogated as to the object of
> these twenty men beings sent in advance of the troops, they evaded the
> truth by replying that they had been detailed for a picket guard.
> 
> The troops were marched. We arrived at the crossing of the railroad at
> 12 o’clock. We were there met by Sharp and others, bearing dispatches
> from the governor, disbanding the troops. This unexpected order threw
> the troops into a perfect panic. They cursed the governor for not
> permitting them to march through to Nauvoo. Their object in wishing to
> go—and this was understood with all the militia—was to burn the city
> and exterminate the inhabitants. These designs were baffled by the
> disbanding of the troops. In justice to the character of Governor
> Ford, I would remark that this object in disbanding the troops, was to

> 
> The disbanding orders were read by Col. Levi Williams. Captains Davis,
> Grover and Elliott, immediately called their companies together.
> 
> Thomas C. Sharp mounted his “big bay horse,” and made an inflammatory
> speech to the companies, characteristic of his corrupt heart. The
> following is a short extract, as near as my memory will serve me:
> 
> “FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS\! The crisis has arrived when it becomes
> our duty to rise, as freemen, and assert our rights. The law is
> insufficient for us; the governor will not enforce it; we must take it
> into our hands; we know what wrongs we suffer, and we are the best
> calculated to redress them. Now is the time to put a period to the mad
> career of the Prophet; sustained as he is by a band of fanatical
> military saints\! We have borne his usurpations until it would be
> cowardice to bear them longer\! My Fellow citizens\! Improve the
> opportunity that offers; lest the opportunity pass, and the despotic
> Prophet will never again be in your power. All things are understood,
> we must hasten to Carthage and murder the Smiths, while the governor
> is absent at Nauvoo. Beard the lions in their den. The news will reach
> Nauvoo before the governor leaves. This will so enrage the “Mormons,”
> that they will fall upon and murder Tom Ford, and we shall then be rid
> of the d—-d little governor and the ‘Mormons’ too.” (Cheers.)

> This speech was likely to fail of having the desired effect. None

> they would do. Several others like myself, followed out of curiosity,
> without being armed. Carthage lay directly on my route home.
> 
> After we had arrived within nearly six miles of Carthage, they made a
> halt. Col. Williams rode three or four times backwards and forwards
> from the company to the Carthage Greys. He said he would have the
> Carthage Greys come and meet them. They marched within four miles of

> will be upon the public square. To keep up appearances, you will

> be loaded with blank cartridges—they will fire in the air.”
> 
> They were also instructed by the person bearing this dispatch, to fire
> three guns as they advanced along the fence that led from the woods to

> 
> His death was instantaneous and tranquil. He betrayed no appearance of

> 
> The ruffian, of whom I have spoken, who set him against the well-curb,

<p><strong>Colonel Richardson</strong> for the defence then arose and addressed the Jury as follows:</p>
<p>You have heard the inditement read in which is contained the charge, alleged against these defendants, the case is one of vast importance inasmuch as it jeopardizes the lives of these five individuals, you are set to judge this case and upon your decision hang there destiny</p>
<p>The prosecutor for the people has endeavoured to work upon your feelings and as much as possible prejudice you against these men, but between the prosecutor for the people and these defendants we have to say that a verdict has not yet either for or against them, and that it can only be done after the case is tried, and the evidence heard on both sides, but Mr. Lamburn would have you beleive that they are guilty of the charge contained in the inditement before they are tried, the people have that to prove yet, upon evidence, but they will fail, and fail most signally, to produce before you, such evidence, as to render a verdict of guilty, but if we may judge of the guilt or innocence of these defendants, by clamorous reports, or by their conduct and deportment in general we have the most decided evidence of their innocence, we have seen no manifestations on their part to evade a trial and escape from Justice but as soon as the inditement was found against them they presented themselves to the bar of the Court for trial, that they might be acquitted from the charge according to law, they have also insisted upon having a trial, the last term of the Court, and they are now come again voluntarily to be tried, and patiently wait the decision of the Law,</p>
<p>All this time, this charge has hung over their heads, their names have gone to the world carrying with them the alledged infamy, and crime, they have expected, as they still expect to gear all this clamorous noise, go forth but the complaintives, will be most signally refuted, and the public opinion corrected, by the testimony, that shall be addressed and by the Law,</p>
<p>The gentleman has intimated that he was sent here by the Governor, of the State, to plead in behalf of the people and that he intends to discharge his duty without fear, in so doing, he will favour these defendants, and every effort, shall be made by the defence, to protect and justify him, in the honest discharge of the same, we are here where we have been all the time, and where we have sought to shelter ourselves, from first, to last, from all the charges, they have preferred against us. When the testimony is heard, we expect them to discuss the testimony and the law, and it will be for you to render your verdict according to that testimony and that Law.</p>

> the Governor finally insisted upon the surrender of the chiefs - and

> the City Council voluntarily surrendered and entered into recognizance
> to appear at Court. Neither party being prepared for the examination
> on the charge of treason, the ac- cused were ordered to be placed in

> martial law in the City, and ordering out the Legion to resist the ex-
> ecution of the laws\*." \[\*Prophet of Palmyra - P. 273\] At the time
> of the Gov- ernors arrival, there were about 1700 men encamped /35/ in
> and around Carthage, and the little town was the scene of great bustle
> and excitement- - We children went sometimes to see the drilling and
> parading - delighted with the tumult and commotion, the music of fife
> and drum, the waving and fluttering of the stars and stripes in the
> warm June breezes. The galloping hither and thither of Colonels and
> Aids de Camp with very red silk sashes, and very bright swords,
> shouting very peremptory orders - were sights and sounds never to be
> forgotten by children unaccustomed to any warlike demonstrations.
> There were other sounds too, for beside the music of fife and drum;
> high above all could be heard l he droning and shrieking of the
> bagpipes, for the ubiquitous Scotchman was there to furnish this to us
> novel and animating music. Sometimes the Piper would be dressed in
> full Highland costume when the kilt, plaids and bonnet added a lustre
> and glory to the Pibroch. So soon as the drill was over, Sandie would
> be sur- rounded by a great crowd of people, listening to the Highland
> marches and "lamentation" which he played remarkably well, and to
> which I for one never wearied of listening - - One of my brothers had
> a faculty of imitating this instrument in a ludicrous manner which
> never /\<£\>/ failed to cause laughter and applause from the home
> circle - He would put a cushion under one arm and with his flute used
> as a "chanter" go through the motions of filling up the pipes with
> wind - puffing out his cheeks, shrieking and groaning up and down the
> gamut as if in search of the tune which when found he would pounce
> upon with the greatest vigor in a most wonderful and rediculous
> imitation of the real thing - I remember one large man with a very red
> face who was considered to be the "crack fifer" of the County - he was
> always on hand at a training and we could be sure a Hancock contingent
> was approaching by a certain tune \[Pencil note: Jefferson & Liberty\]
> he always played when near to a large crowd - a tune well calculated
> to make a man "keep step" whether he had any idea of time or no -
> After the prisoners arrival at Garthage - some of the men among the
> militia from adjoining Counties - expressed a wish to see the Smiths--
> and the Governor hear- ing of this, decided to give them all an
> opportunity of gratifying this desire - Without making his intention
> known to them however, The general commanding Singleton\[1\] ordered
> all the troops out as if for parade - among them was a well drilled
> and uniformed company called the Carthage Greys both men and officers
> being citizens of Carthages and well acquainted with the character and
> reputation of the prisoners - some of the troops (including the Greys)
> were encamped /yi/ on the South side of the square - being drawn up in
> front of their tents expecting evry moment to see the Governor & his
> Staff appear for the review - After wait- ing some time they saw
> coming from the direction of Hamiltons Hotel - the Sheriff, Mr.
> Demming,\[2\] with the two Smiths - Joseph upon one arm and Hyrum upon
> the other. They walked quietly to the extreme right of the troops -
> when the Sheriff began introducing them right and left - Gentlemen
> this is General Joseph Smith - Mr. Hyrum Smith gentleman - All along
> the crowded line they passed bowing and smiling - until they reached
> the vicinity of the Greys who had been interested spectators of these
> proceedings - the significance of which was gradually dawning upon
> them - Here were two men, prisoners, under arrest for the crime of
> treason and many others being escorted by the Sheriff - the Gov- ernor
> and Staff looking on with complaisancy as if they were persons of
> distinc- tion - This was too much for the patience of the boys in Grey
> who began crying out no no - no introductions for us - and as they
> came nearer, groans and hisses and cries of down with all impostors
> came from the men. The Sheriffs face turned red - but Smiths was the
> color of ashes as /30\*/ he said "let us get back to the Hotel\!" and
> turning they walked rapidly away in that direction. The people at the

> were obliged to give him a stimulent to prevent his fainting - and

> where after dinner they were taken - The Governor was much chagrined
> at this turn of affairs and as he con- sidered the Greys to have been

> It was asserted that Joe Smith, the founder and head of the Mormon
> church, had caused himself to be crowned and anointed king of the
> Mormons; that he had embodied a band of his followers called Danites,
> who were sworn to obey him as God, and to do his commands, murder and
> treason not excepted; that he had instituted an order in the church
> whereby those who composed it were pretended to be sealed up to
> eternal life against all crimes save the shedding of innocent blood or
> consenting thereto. That this order was instructed that no blood was
> innocent blood, except that of the members of the church; and that
> these two orders were made the ministers of his vengeance and the
> instruments of an intolerable tyranny which he had established over
> his people, and which he was about to extend over the neighboring
> country. The people affected to believe that with this power in the
> hands of an unscrupulous leader there was no safety for the lives or
> property of any one who should oppose him. They affected likewise to
> believe that Smith inculcated the legality of perjury or any other
> crime in defence, or to advance, the interests of true believers; and
> that he himself had set them the example by swearing to a false
> accusation against a certain person for the crime of murder. It was
> likewise asserted to be a fundamental article of the Mormon faith that
> God had given the world and all it contained to them as his saints;
> that they secretly believed in their right to all the goodly lands,
> farms, and property in the country; that at present they were kept out
> of their rightful inheritance by force; that consequently there was no
> moral offence in anticipating God's good time to put them in
> possession by stealing, if opportunity offered; that in fact the whole
> church was a community of murderers, thieves, robbers, and outlaws;

> accoutrements. Of these, the three pieces of cannon and two hundred
> and twenty stand of small arms were surrendered. These arms were

> departed for Nauvoo, eighteen miles distant, accompanied by Col.
> Buckmaster, Quartermaster-General, and Capt. Dunn's company of
> dragoons. After we had proceeded four miles Colonel Buckmaster
> intimated to me a suspicion that an attack would be made upon the
> jail. He stated the matter as a mere suspicion, arising from having
> seen two persons converse together at Carthage with some air of
> mystery. I myself entertained no suspicion of such an attack; at any
> rate, none before the next day in the afternoon; because it was
> notorious that we had departed from Carthage with the declared
> intention of being absent at least two days. I could not believe that
> any person would attack the jail whilst we were in Nauvoo and thereby
> expose my life and the lives of my companions to the sudden vengeance
> of the Mormons upon hearing of the death of their leaders.
> Nevertheless, acting upon the principle of providing against mere
> possibilities, I sent back one of the company with a special order to
> Capt. Smith to guard the jail strictly and at the peril of his life
> until my return. We proceeded on our journey four miles farther. By
> this time I had convinced myself that no attack would be made on the
> jail that day or night. I supposed that a regard for my safety and the
> safety of my companions would prevent an attack until those to be
> engaged in it could be assured of our departure from Nauvoo. I still
> think that this ought to have appeared to me to be a reasonable
> supposition. I therefore determined at this point to omit making the
> search for counterfeit money at Nauvoo and defer an examination of all
> the other abominations charged on that people in order to return to
> Carthage that same night, that I might be on the ground in person In
> time to prevent an attack upon the jail, if any had been meditated. To
> this end we called a halt; the baggage wagons were ordered to remain
> where they were until towards evening, and then return to Carthage.
> Having made these arrangements we proceeded on our march and arrived
> at Nauvoo about four o'clock of the afternoon of the 27th day of June.
> As soon as notice could be given a crowd of the citizens assembled to
> hear an address which I proposed to deliver to them. The number
> present has been variously estimated from one to five thousand. In
> this address I stated to them how, and in what, their functionaries
> had violated the laws. Also, the many scandalous reports in
> circulation against them, and that these reports, whether true or
> false, were generally believed by the people. I distinctly stated to
> them the amount of hatred and prejudice which prevailed everywhere
> against them, and the causes of it, at length. I also told them
> plainly and emphatically that if any vengeance should be attempted
> openly or secretly against the persons or property of the citizens who
> had taken part against their leaders that the public hatred and
> excitement was such that thousands would assemble for the total
> destruction of their city and the extermination of their people; and
> that no power in the State would be able to prevent it. During this
> address some impatience and resentment were manifested by the Mormons
> at the recital of the various reports enumerated concerning them;
> which they strenuously and indignantly denied to be true. They claimed
> to be a law-abiding people and insisted that as they looked to the law
> alone for their protection, so were they careful themselves to observe
> its provisions. Upon the conclusion of this address I proposed to take
> a vote on the question whether they would strictly observe the laws,
> even in opposition to their prophet and leaders. The vote was
> unanimous in favor of this proposition. The anti-Mormons contended
> that such a vote from the Mormons signified nothing; and truly the
> subsequent history of that people showed clearly that they were
> loudest in their professions of attachment to the law whenever they
> were guilty of the greatest extravagances; and in fact that they were
> so ignorant and stupid about matters of law that they had no means of
> judging of the legality of their conduct, only as they were instructed
> by their spiritual leaders.
> 
> A short time before sundown we departed on our return to Carthage.
> When we had proceeded two miles we met two individuals, one of them a
> Mormon, who informed us that the Smiths had been assassinated in jail,
> about five or six o'clock of that day. The intelligence seemed to
> strike every one with a kind of dumbness. As to myself, it was
> perfectly astounding; and I anticipated the very worst consequences
> from it. The Mormons had been represented to me as a lawless,
> infatuated, and fanatical people, not governed by the ordinary motives

> exterminating war would ensue and the whole land would be covered with
> desolation. Acting upon this supposition, it was my duty to provide as
> well as I could for the event. I therefore ordered the two messengers
> into custody and to be returned with us to Carthage. This was done to
> get time to make such arrangements as could be made, and to prevent
> any sudden explosion of Mormon excitement before they could be written
> to by their friends at Carthage. I also despatched messengers to
> Warsaw to advise the citizens of the event. But the people there knew
> all about the matter before my messengers arrived. They, like myself,
> anticipated a general attack all over the country. The women and
> children were removed across the river; and a committee was despatched
> that night to Quincy for assistance. The next morning by daylight the
> ringing of the bells in the city of Quincy announced a public meeting.
> The people assembled in great numbers at an early hour. The Warsaw
> committee stated to the meeting that a party of Mormons had attempted
> to rescue the Smiths out of jail; that a party of Missourians and
> others had killed the prisoners to prevent their escape; that the
> governor and his party were at Nauvoo at the time when intelligence of
> the fact was brought there; that they had been attacked by the Nauvoo
> legion and had retreated to a house, where they were then closely
> besieged. That the governor had sent out word that he could maintain
> his position for two days, and would be certain to be massacred if
> assistance did not arrive by the end of that time. It is unnecessary
> to say that this entire story was a fabrication. It was of a piece
> with the other reports put into circulation by the anti-Mormon party
> to influence the public mind and call the people to their assistance.
> The effect of it, however, was that by ten o'clock on the 28th of June
> between two and three hundred men from Quincy under the command of
> Major Flood embarked on board a steamboat for Nauvoo to assist in
> raising the siege, as they honestly believed. As for myself, I was

> agreed amongst them that the murder must be committed whilst the
> governor was at Nauvoo; that the Mormons would naturally suppose that
> he had planned it; and that in the first outpouring of their
> indignation they would assassinate him by way of retaliation. And that
> thus they would get clear of the Smiths and the governor all at once.
> They also supposed that if they could so contrive the matter as to
> have the governor of the State assassinated by the Mormons the public
> excitement would be greatly increased against that people and would
> result in their expulsion from the State at least. Upon hearing of the
> assassination of the Smiths I was sensible that my command was at an

> force in which I could confide, and that I ought to establish my
> headquarters at a place where I could learn the truth as to what was
> going on. For these reasons I determined to proceed to Quincy, a place
> favorably situated for receiving the earliest intelligence, for
> issuing orders to raise an army if necessary, and for providing
> supplies for its subsistence. But first I determined to return back to
> Carthage and make such arrangements as could be made for the
> pacification and defence of the country. When I arrived there about
> ten o'clock at night I found that great consternation prevailed. Many

> preparing to go. As the country was utterly defenceless this seemed to
> me to be a proper precaution. One company of the guard stationed by me
> to guard the jail had disbanded and gone home before the jail was
> attacked; and many of the Carthage Grays departed soon afterwards.
> Gen. Deming, who was absent in the country during the murder, had
> returned; he volunteered to remain in command of a few men, with

> retreat if menaced by a superior force. Here also I found Dr. Richards

> intelligence of the murder which was received at Nauvoo. I think it
> very probable that the subsequent good conduct of the Mormons is

> done their party would abandon the State. This requisition was refused
> of course. During this time also, with the view of saving expense,
> keeping the peace, and having a force which would be removed from the

> five hundred men of the regular army to be stationed for a time in
> Hancock county, which was subsequently refused. During this time also

> alliance with the Mormons; that the leaders would not be brought to
> punishment, but that a full privilege would be accorded to them to
> commit crimes of every hue and grade in return for their support of
> the democratic party. I mention this not by way of complaint, for it
> is only the privilege of the minority to complain, but for its
> influence upon the people. I observed that I was narrowly watched in
> all my proceedings by my whig fellow citizens, and was suspected of an
> intention to favor the Mormons. I felt that I did not possess the
> confidence of the men I commanded, and that they had been induced to
> withhold it by the promulgation of the most abominable falsehoods. I
> felt the necessity of possessing their confidence in order to give
> vigor to my action; and exerted myself in every way to obtain it, so
> that I could control the excited multitude who were under my command.
> I succeeded better for a time than could have been expected; but who
> can control the action of a mob without possessing their entire
> confidence? It is true also that some unprincipled democrats all the
> time appeared to be very busy on the side of the Mormons. and this
> circumstance was well calculated to increase suspicion of every one
> who had the name of democrat.
> 
> It was many days after the assassination of the Smiths before the
> circumstances of the murder fully became known. It then appeared that,
> agreeably to previous orders, the posse at Warsaw had marched on the
> morning of the 27th of June in the direction of Golden's Point, with a
> view to join the force from Carthage, the whole body then to be
> marched into Nauvoo. But by the time they had gone eight miles, they
> were met by the order to disband; and learning at the same time that
> the governor was absent at Nauvoo, about two hundred of these men,
> many of them being disguised by blacking their faces with powder and
> mud, hastened immediately to Carthage. There they encamped, at some
> distance from the village, and soon learned that one of the companies
> left as a guard had disbanded and returned to their homes; the other
> company, the Carthage Greys, was stationed by the captain in the
> public square, a hundred and fifty yards from the jail. Whilst eight
> men were detailed by him, under the command of Sergeant Franklin A.

> who was left in command, being deserted by some of his troops, and
> perceiving the arrangement with the others, and having no force upon
> which he could rely, for fear of his life retired from the village.
> The conspirators came up, jumped the slight fence around the jail,

> overpowered immediately, and the assailants entered the prison, to the
> door of the room where the two prisoners were confined, with two of
> their friends, who voluntarily bore them company. An attempt was made

> pistol, furnished by his friends, fired several times as the door was
> bursted open, and wounded three of the assailants. At the same time
> several shots were fired into the room, by some of which John Taylor
> received four wounds, and Hyrum Smith was instantly killed. Joe Smith
> now attempted to escape by jumping out of the second-story window, but
> the fall so stunned him that he was unable to rise; and being placed
> in a sitting posture by the conspirators below, they dispatched him
> with four balls shot through his body. Thus fell Joe Smith, the most
> successful impostor in modern times.; a man who, though ignorant and
> coarse, had some great natural parts, which fitted him for temporary
> success, but which were so obscured and counteracted by the inherent
> corruption and vices of his nature, that he never could succeed in
> establishing a system of policy which looked to permanent success in
> the future. His lusts, his love of money and power, always set him to
> studying present gratification and convenience, rather than the remote
> consequences of his plans. It seems that no power of intellect can
> save a corrupt man from this error. The strong cravings of the animal
> nature will never give fair play to a fine understanding, the judgment
> is never allowed to choose that good which is far away, in preference
> to enticing evil near at hand. And this may be considered a wise
> ordinance of Providence, by which the counsels of talented but corrupt
> men, are defeated in the very act which promised success. It must not
> be supposed that the pretended Prophet practiced the tricks of a
> common impostor; that he was a dark and gloomy person, with a long
> beard, a grave and severe aspect, and a reserved and saintly carriage
> of his person; on the contrary, he was full of levity, even to boyish
> romping; dressed like a dandy, and at times drank like a sailor and
> swore like a pirate. He could, as occasion required, be exceedingly
> meek in his deportment; and then again rough and boisterous as a
> highway robber; being always able to satisfy his followers of the
> propriety of his conduct. He always quailed before power, and was
> arrogant to weakness. At times he could put on the air of a penitent,
> as if feeling the deepest humiliation for his sins, and suffering
> unutterable anguish, and indulging in the most gloomy forebodings of
> eternal woe. At such times he would call for the prayers of the
> brethren in his behalf, with a wild and fearful energy and
> earnestness. He was full six feet high, strongly built , and
> uncommonly well muscled. No doubt he was as much indebted for his
> influence over an ignorant people, to the superiority of his physical
> vigor, as to his greater cunning and intellect. His followers were
> divided into the leaders and the led; the first division embraced a
> numerous class of broken down, unprincipled men of talents, to be
> found in every country, who, bankrupt in character and fortune, had
> nothing to lose by deserting the known religions, and carving out a
> new one of their own. They were mostly infidels, who holding all
> religions in derision, believed that they had as good a right as
> Christ or Mahomet, or any of the founders of former systems, to create
> one for themselves; and if they could impose it upon mankind, to live
> upon the labor of their dupes. Those of the second division, were the
> credulous wondering part of men, whose easy belief and admiring
> natures, are always the victims of novelty, in whatever shape it may
> come, who have a capacity to believe any strange and wonderful matter,
> if it only be new, whilst the wonders of former ages command neither
> faith nor reverence; they were men of feeble purposes, readily
> subjected to the will of the strong, giving themselves up entirely to
> the direction of their leaders; and this accounts for the very great
> influence of those leaders in controlling them. In other respects some
> of the Mormons were abandoned rogues, who had taken shelter in Nauvoo,
> as a convenient place for the head-quarters of their villainy; and
> others were good, honest, industrious people, who were the sincere
> victims of an artful delusion. Such as these were more the proper
> objects of pity than persecution. With them, their religious belief
> was a kind of insanity; and certainly no greater calamity can befall a
> human being, than to have a mind so constituted as to be made the
> sincere dupe of a religious impostor. The more polished portion of the
> Mormons were a merry set of fellows, fond of music and dancing, dress
> and gay assemblies. They had their regular dancing parties of
> gentlemen and ladies, and were by no means exclusive in admitting any
> one to them on the score of character. It is a notorious fact, that a
> desperado by the name of Rockwell, having attracted the affections of
> a pretty woman, the wife of a Mormon merchant, took her from her
> husband by force of arms, to live with him in adultery. But whilst she
> was so living notoriously in adultery with a Mormon bully, in the same
> city with her husband, she was freely admitted to the best society in
> the place, to all the gay assemblies, where she and her husband
> frequently met in the same dance.

> As President Young said, they were men and they were perhaps the best
> men that lived. They might have some little weaknesses and foibles
> like other men, but if they had been better than that they would not
> \[have\] been fit to associate with people.20 But they were men of God
> and lived and died in faith of that gospel. They preached and did it
> sincerely with honest hearts before God and men. And, therefore, I
> feel pleasure in testifying of these things. . . . The governor by and
> by made his appearance at Carthage, and he sent a deputation down to
> Joseph Smith requesting him to send out a deputation to him to wait
> upon him in Carthage to acquaint him with \[the\] state of affairs in
> Nauvoo. Joseph Smith appointed Doctor Bernhisel,58 who is now in
> Washington, and myself to go with the deputies of the governor and
> meet him in Carthage and to take with us the papers. We had the
> documents, affidavits, testimonies, etc., that had been presented
> before Joseph Smith of acts of violence that had been sworn to by
> different individual\[s\] as they came and made their cases known to
> him. I believe Squire Wells took a good many of them. We went to the
> governor and found everything there in \[the\] greatest state of
> excitement. All the blacklegs, murderers (though some of them I was
> acquainted with and believe them to be such from our testimony),
> apostates, and greatest enemies that Joseph Smith and Mormonism had in
> the country were there; and as it is said about Brutus having his
> right hand men, many of them seemed to me to be the right hand men of
> the governor. We did not obtain an interview with him immediately, but
> perhaps it might be well here to relate a little incident occurred
> about the time we arrived there about 11 at night. We went right to
> the hotel the governor stayed at and took up our quarters there. We
> had not been in there ten minutes when there was a soldier came in and
> he knew that one of our brethren, Brother Carns59 of German descent,
> as good \[a\] man \[as\] anywhere, 60 he had been committing some
> great misdemeanor, he \[the soldier\] said. And naturally that it was
> necessary he \[Carns\] should be imprisoned. But they felt bowels61 of
> compassion towards him, being \[the\] man held, and they wanted one of
> us to go and give bail for them. It struck me to be \[a\] rather
> curious kind of night to take up prisoners to give bail, and we knew
> our documents to be laid before the governor. I said, “I don’t believe
> your statement about Carns, but if bail is necessary, tomorrow morning
> 62 \[will\] go and see him and it will all be right.” We passed along
> and went to our lodging, and as we were going into our room we passed
> through another room and we saw laying in that room a man by the name
> of Jackson,63 a repeat murderer. Our bed was placed beside64 his, just
> two board posts between. We had with us arms. I had a good six
> shooter. I did not sleep any that night. Thought I would be on the
> alert as nobody else was. So we had just got into bed when \[a\] rap
> came to to \[the\] door and Chauncey Higbee came \[in\]. Many of you
> know him, a notorious scamp, as black \[an\] apostate and full of
> \[the\] devil as anybody. He came there and knocked at our door and of
> course he thought it would be of no use speaking to me after what has
> taken place now. Doctrine “Doctor, it is a pity Carns should be in.65
> Believe him to be a good sort of fellow. Sorry to see him lying in
> jail. Would it not be better to go and liberate him?” Talked with the
> doctor and he thought he would go. Chauncey went out of \[the\] room
> until he got his clothes on. Says I, “You may better stay where you
> are. Don’t you know, we have papers and documents? \[Their\] very
> purpose \[is to\] part us to destroy us either one of us.” We stayed
> together that night. Towards the next night we had an interview with
> the governor he when we went into the room he was surrounded with just
> such characters \[as\] I had mentioned. And if it had not been
> \[that\] I was going on public business, if I had been on private
> instead of public, I should have turned around and said, “Governor
> Ford, if you choose to \[be\] with such characters as these, I shall
> withdraw.” But it was necessary we should do our business in \[a\]
> public capacity. I said we had been sent by General Smith, that we had
> with us documents to inform him of \[the\] position of the country and
> all what was going on generally. He took our documents and commenced
> reading them, but while he was reading another one \[would\] say,
> “That is a lie,” another, “That is a damned lie,” another, “That is
> a God damned lie.” But his Excellency did not hear it. Perhaps he
> thought it very polite. It passed off comfortably with him. The result
> of it was he told us he would prepare a letter for us. He did so
> sometime late on in the evening. We got a letter and went back to
> Nauvoo with it. When Joseph Smith read the letter, he believed there
> was mischief intended by the governor and the parties. And we talked
> over the matter for \[a\] length of time in the Nauvoo Mansion. And
> finally there was some gentlemen came in, some relation of the late
> president, and wished to see Joseph Smith and have some little
> conversation with him.66 As it was very late, and we had been up for
> one or two nights before, I went out off and left him that that
> evening. In the morning I heard Hyrum and Joseph \[and\] one or two
> others crossed the river and thought it \[the\] best thing to go. I
> crossed but did not see him until sometime \[the\] next day when I got
> word from him. Brother Elias Smith went to search \[for\] Joseph
> \[and\] brought me word that Joseph and Hyrum had concluded to go to
> Carthage and requested me to come and go along. I had peculiar
> feelings at the time. I had not seen them, but I had been arranging my
> business to leave in half an hour. I should have been started east
> except if I did not find them over the river I should meet them by
> there. There was peculiar feelings among many of the brethren in
> relation to it.67 I was not there during the whole of those
> deliberations. As I said, I was preparing to arrange my business for
> the east. Hyrum extended a strong wish to return and stated his
> feelings precisely, and Joseph gave way to his brother’s feelings.
> Joseph had told them in \[a\] public speech before, says he, “brethren
> I will stand by you to the death.” Some of \<’em\>68 went and asked
> him if he was going to leave them now, so I heard. I do not know the
> particulars of course. Then he turned around and said, “Die? Yes, I am
> a man of honor and integrity. I stand up to my post if the devil stand
> in the way.” There was nothing of cowardice in him. Rest Lots of
> brethren others here say no one69 sought to destroy the brethren. He
> went out with \<100\>70 men to meet in the prairie to meet 2500—no,
> nothing of cowardice. But he thought it would be better to ward off
> the blow a little while and trust to pardon to regulate things when
> the storm should be \[a\] little abated. These, I believe, were his
> feelings in going over the river. We had been . . . . I believe . . .
> Before that, I must mention a circumstance here. That the city charter
> of Nauvoo possessed the right of a writ of habeas corpus, which gave
> the parties the privilege of being taken from before an officer, if
> they considered there was injustice going to be done them, and receive
> a trial in another place. Before this mob came—before \[the\] governor
> came—Brother Joseph, Brother Hyrum, and all of the city council
> appeared before Squire Wells, who was then one of the magistrate\[s\]
> to answer to this charge brought them against them. The municipal
> \[court\] issued a writ of habeas corpus, and the city marshal took us
> out of \[the\] hands of \[an\] officer sent from Carthage, and we was
> brought before Squire Wells. Why? Because he was not in the Church at
> that time and they could not have any reasonable objections for us to
> be tried before him in order to conciliate the people.71 We were
> acquitted, but we72 were not satisfied. Now I return to where I left
> off. We agreed to go to Carthage. Joseph said very little when we
> went, but he did talk \[of\] feelings on leaving home. I remember a
> remark that President Young made down at North Ogden \[one\] day a
> while ago in speaking about Brother Joseph. He said at that time, he
> believed the spirit of God was withdrawn from it at the time and he
> was left to grapple with the powers of darkness. I believe it. I

1.  James W. Singleton of Mt. Sterling was brigadier general of the
    Illinois Militia in 1844, and in command of the force at Carthage.
    See Howard F. Dyson, ed., History of Schuyler County in Newton
    Bateman and Paul Selby, eds., Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois
    and History of Schuyler County (Chicago: Munsell Publishing Company,
    1908), p. 481.

2.  Minor R. Deming actually was not elected Hancock County sheriff
    until August. In June he was the commander of the Hancock County
    militia. A new interest in Deming has been kindled by Professor
    Robert M. Sutton of the University of Illinois, particularly
    subsequent to his reading of a paper on Deming before the Mormon
    History Association at Chicago on April 29, 1967

3.  The author's two older brothers were William, already cited, and
    Edwin Baldwin (1825-?). Their membership in the Greys is also
    indicated in Scofield, p. 918.

4.  Helen Baldwin Williams Wilson Hunt (1 821-1887) was the sister of
    the author. Her first husband was Samuel Otho Williams, a second
    lieutenant in the Greys who died Nov. 28, 1844, not long after the
    Smith murders. The younger sister was Mary J. Baldwin, who died
    short of her seventeenth birthday in 1853. See Carthage Gazette,
    Dec. 16, 1887, p. 1; Scofield, p. 918.

5.  This is almost certainly Capt. Robert F. Smith, who was not only an
    important figure in the Greys but also the justice of the peace who
    had ordered, by means of a dubious legal instrument, the jailing of
    the Smiths.

6.  Mrs. Marsh had no brother named Tom. The brother whose name is
    disguised here is apparently Edwin. See note 20.

7.  This is J. H. Sherman, about whom the editors have been able to
    discover very little. It is interesting to note, however, that
    Gregg, in whose book Mrs. Marsh un- doubtedly found this account,
    Scofield, and Mrs. Marsh all give only Sherman's initials, whereas
    Sherman, who published a series of ten articles on the Mormons in
    the Ithaca (N.Y.) Journal in 1886, was willing to sign his name. We
    reprint his account because it appears to be a genuine eyewitness
    account that is virtually unremarked in the liter- ature of the
    assassination. See also Thomas Gregg, The Prophet of Palmyra . . .
    (New Vork: John B. Alden, Publisher, 1890), pp. 278-80; Scofield,
    pp. 846-47.

8.  Periods in original MS.

9.  While Mrs. Marsh is here again attempting to disguise her own
    identity, it should be noted that her mother's maiden name was
    Brown, according to family Bible entries.

10. Periods in original MS.

11. What Mrs. Marsh is attempting to imply, rather slyly and indirectly
    through Mr. C, is that the often-heard reports that there were
    Missourians in the mob at Carthage were true.
