The bodies had been prepared. The death masks had been cast. The people
had learned the truth, the prophet and patriarch had been shot to death
by anti-Mormons.

The bodies were placed in coffins “which were covered with black velvet,
fastened with brass nails.” They placed a glass lid over the face of
each body to protect it, and the coffin was “lined with white cambric.”
Then, Emma and Mary, Jo’s and Hyrum’s first wives, were allowed into the
mansion room to see their husbands. The children came along too.

> Emma (who was at the time pregnant) was then permitted to view the
> bodies. On first seeing the corpse of her husband she screamed and
> fell, but was supported by Dimick B. Huntington. She then fell upon
> his face and kissed him, calling him by name, and begged of him to
> speak to her once: the scene was too affecting almost to be borne.
> 
> Mary (Hyrum’s wife) was also admitted, and manifested calmness and
> composure throughout the trying scene. The children of the martyred
> Prophet and Patriarch were then admitted to see the bodies, when the
> scene beggared description, being perfectly heartrending.

The next morning at 8 a.m., the bodies were placed in the main living
area of the Nauvoo Mansion and the doors were opened to receive the
mourning procession. Estimates claim about 8-10,000 Mormon filed through
the mansion on June 29th 1844 to view the bodies.

People took these deaths in many ways. We’re lucky enough that some of
them took the time to sit down and express their thoughts in writing, so
let’s spend some time with some of these folks.

**Accounts:**

**Emma Hale Smith and Mary Fielding Smith**

Emma was the first wife of Joseph. Mary was Hyrum’s first wife. Neither
of these women wrote any of their thoughts at the time so the best we
can do is read accounts from those who observed them on that distressing
day. You’ll recognize a little bit from the History of the Church I read
from earlier but there’s a fair amount more information here to help us
visualize the scene. Mormon Enigma P. 196-7

> B. W. Richmond said Emma tried several times to walk across the room
> but each time she fainted. Finally a friend helped her form the room.
> Then Mary Fielding Smith entered with her four children. “She trembled
> at every step, and nearly fell, but reached her husband’s body, and
> kneeled down by him, clasped her arm around his head, turned his pale
> face upon her heaving bosom, and then a gushing ,plaintive wail burst
> from her lips: ‘O\! Hyrum, Hyrum\! Have they shot you, my dear Hyrum?
> Are you dead? O\! Speak to me, my dear husband. I cannot think you are
> dead, my dear Hyrum.’” Richmond said, “Her grief seemed to consume
> her, and she lost all power of utterance. Her two daughters, and the
> two young children, clung some to her body, falling prostrate upon the
> corpse and shrieking in the wildness of their wordless grief.”
> 
> A few minutes later Dimick Huntington and another man assisted Emma
> back into the room. Dimick held his hat up to shield her view of
> Joseph. The two led her over to where Hyrum lay and Richmond took her
> hand and placed it on Hyrum’s forehead. Emma stood for a minute, then
> said, “Now I can see him; I am strong now.” Unassisted, she walked to
> Joseph where she “kneeled down, clasped him around his face, and sank
> upon his body. Suddenly her grief found vent, and sighs and groans and
> words and lamentations filled the room. ‘JOseph, Joseph,’ she said,
> ‘are you dead? Have the assassins shot you?’ Her children, four in
> number, gathered around their weeping mother, and the dead body of a
> murdered father, and grief that words cannot embody seemed to
> overwhelm the whole group.” Richmond said Emma spoke softly to Joseph
> and the only words he heard were the ones he recorded. Young Joseph
> remembered her saying, “Oh, Joseph, Joseph\! My husband, my husband\!
> Have they taken you from me at last\!” Twenty-four years later Dimick
> Huntington claimed he heard Emma ask Joseph to forgive her.

**Lucy Mack Smith**

Lucy needs no introduction, she was mother of Joseph and Hyrum. She
dictated this to Martha Corey after she had withstood the pain of
burying 5 of her 6 sons as well as her husband and she was quite late in
years.

> spectacle before me. Oh\! at that moment how my mind flew through
> every scene of sorrow and distress which we had passed together, in
> which they had shown the innocence and sympathy which filled their
> guileless hearts. As I looked upon their peaceful, smiling
> countenances, I seemed almost to hear them say,—“Mother, weep not for
> us, we have overcome the world by love; we carried to them the Gospel,
> that their souls might be saved; they slew us for our testimony, and
> thus placed us beyond their power; their ascendancy is for a moment,
> ours is an eternal triumph.”
> 
> I then thought upon the promise which I had received in Missouri, that
> in five years Joseph should have power over all his enemies. The time
> had elapsed, and the promise was fulfilled.

**William Clayton**

Personal secretary of Joseph Smith, keeper of the Council of Fifty
Minutes and Jo’s personal journal. He was very close to the prophet and
was instrumental in building the Nauvoo kingdom.

> “And now O God wilt thou not come out of thy hiding place and avenge
> the blood of thy servants.--that blood which thou hast so long watched
> over with a fatherly care--that blood so noble--so generous--so
> dignified, so heavenly you O Lord will thou not avenge it speedily and
> bring down vengeance upon the murderers of thy servants that they may
> be rid from off the earth and that the earth may be cleansed from
> these scenes, even so O Lord thy will be done. We look to thee for
> justice. Hear thy people O God of Jacob even so Amen”
> 
> “Few expressions were heard save the mourns for the loss of our
> friends. All seem to hang on the merch of God and wait further events.
> Some few can scarce refrain from expressing aloud their indignation at
> the Governor and a few words would raise the City in arms & massacre
> the Cities of Carthage & Warsaw & lay them in ashes but it is wisdom
> to be quiet. After the bodies were laid out I went to see them. Joseph
> looks very natural except being pale through loss of blood. Hyrum does
> not look so natural. Their aged mother is distracted with grief & it
> will be almost more than she can bear.”
> 
> “The blood of those men, and the prayers of the widows and orphans and
> a suffering community will rise up to the Lord of Sabaoth for
> vengeance upon those murderers.”

**Eliza R. Snow**

A powerful poet and personal secretary of Emma in the Nauvoo Relief
Society. She frequently wrote poems to specific people for reasons of
mourning, encouragement, or threatening. She was also a dearly beloved
plural wife of Jo, creating plenty of conflict in her life as she was
marrying age but off limits to be courted by any other men. She became
the most powerful woman in Utah.

**B.W. Richmond**

This is an account written by a non-Mormon who witnessed the funeral
procession, which describes what he saw with Lucinda Pendleton Morgan
Harris Smith, Jo’s first official plural wife and the widow of the famed
William Morgan who disappeared after publishing an expose on
FreeMasonry.

> While the two wives were bewailing their loss, and prostrate on the
> floor with their eight children, I noticed a lady standing at the head
> of Joseph Smith’s body, her face covered, and her whole frame
> convulsed with weeping. She was the widow of William Morgan, of
> Masonic memory, and twenty years before had stood over the body of her
> husband, found at the mouth of Oak Orchard Creek, on Lake Ontario. She
> was now the wife of a Mr. Harris, whom she married in Batavia, and who
> was a saint in the Mormon church, and a high Mason. She is a short
> person, with light hair and very bright blue eyes, and pleasing
> countenance. I had called on her a few days previous to this occasion,
> and while conversing with her, put my hand on a gilt-edged volumen
> laying on the stand. It was ‘Stearns on Masonry,’ and contained the
> likeness of William Morgan. She said she had taken it out, and thought
> if the mob did come, and she was obliged to flee, or jump into the
> Mississippi, she would take it with her.

**Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball**

Young and Kimball were traveling through the eastern states holding
meetings with powerful individuals for Jo’s presidential campaign. They
both record when they first heard the rumors that Jo had been murdered
as well as when they received actual confirmation.

> \--9-- I heard today, for the first time, the rumors concerning the
> death of Joseph and Hyrum \[Smith\].
> 
> \--16-- While at Brother Bement's house in Peterboro', I heard a
> letter read which Brother Livingston had received from Mr. Joseph
> Powers, of Nauvoo, giving particulars of the murder of Joseph and
> Hyrum. The first thing which I thought of was, whether Joseph had
> taken the keys of the kingdom with him from the earth; Brother Orson
> Pratt sat on my left; we were both leaning back on our chairs.
> Bringing my hand down on my knee, I said the keys of the kingdom are
> right here with the Church.
> 
> Received a letter from Brother Woodruff confirming the news of the
> death of the Prophets.

**Kimball:  
**Heber C. Kimball was a close friend of Brigham Young before they both
joined the church in the early 1830s. His wife, Vilate, and he shared
many letters back and forth. Heber himself was uneducated and his
writing reflects it but he was a relatively faithful journal keeper.
Heber and Vilate’s daughter, Helen, was given to the prophet as a wife
at the age of 14.

> 9 Tuesday… The papers were full of News of the death of our Prophet. I
> was not willen to believe it, fore it was to much to bare. The first
> news I got of his death was on Tuesday morning in Salum of the 9. It
> struck me at the heart…
> 
> 12 Friday… Toords night one of the Brethren went to the office and got
> one leter from my wife up the the 24 which day he gave Him Self up in
> company with Hiyrum, Richards, and J. Tailor three days before they
> ware killed. This leter satisfide us that the Brethren ware dead. O
> Lord what feelings we had.
> 
> 14 Sunday morning went to meting. Red the news to the saints. Great
> sorrow prevailed and agreed to dress in mourning. O Lord How can we
> part with our dear Br., O Lord save the Twelve.

**Dan Jones**

Dan Jones was Jo’s little birdie of Nauvoo. Jones always had intel that
was valuable to the prophet about people in and out of the city. Because
of his ability to gather intel, he became captain of the steamer owned
by the prophet, The Maid of Iowa, where he saw most people who entered
and exited the city. He was very close to Joseph Smith and was one of
the last of Jo’s trusted acolytes that was chased out of Carthage by the
Carthage Greys the day the assassinations happened.

> About midnight a steamboat came down the river, and I went on board
> toward Quincy (forty miles from there) and before daylight the boat
> called at Warsaw on its way, and great was the tumult which was
> there\! It was announced with great delight to the passengers on the
> boat that "Joe and his brother, Hyrum, had been killed at Carthage
> Jail." Oh, how sweet was this news to their chops\! That old "Sharp"
> again had already published an extra with great haste accusing the
> Mormons of having gone to Carthage to save the prisoners and that the
> guards in carrying out their duty had shot J. and H. Smith lest they
> escape, when in fact, I was the last Mormon to have been in Carthage
> and had been driven out as if at bayonet point\! Yes, when in fact it
> was that very man, Sharp, who was leading those who killed the
> prisoners, boasting "that he had put one bullet through old Joe." And
> when his fingers were still dripping with innocent blood he proclaimed
> to the world that it was the Saints who had done it and invited all
> from everywhere to gather to defend Warsaw, that the Mormons had
> burned Carthage to ashes and killed its inhabitants, Governor Ford and
> all, and that they expected them to burn Warsaw at any minute\! Yes,
> he published this in his paper and sent messengers to the other
> countries to call the militia to defend them when in fact he knew that
> he was in no danger whatsoever from the Saints.
> 
> And when I was there I heard his party admit and praise the
> cunningness of Sharp's trick to get people there; and that their
> objective was to "attack the city of Nauvoo and kill or expel the
> 'd-m-d Mormons.'" This false story about the massacre of J. and H.
> Smith flew across the world, and we do not think that the truth had
> even yet been determined. An example in that of all the publications
> of that man, Sharp, and his party against the Saints. I was so
> impulsive as to contradict them on the bank from what I knew, and had
> the boat not been alongside to jump onto they would have killed me for
> what I said. After reaching Quincy I saw that the messengers of Sharp
> had arrived and had stirred up the entire city to the point that they
> were expecting the Mormons to come there and kill them too, and the
> militia was hurriedly preparing to go to save Warsaw, as they
> supposed.
> 
> When I got the opportunity with the people together, I opposed those
> lying messengers to their faces, and then the people saw that they
> were not in danger and that not one of the Mormons had even lifted his
> hand against any one of them and had no such intention. Then everyone
> returned to his business, and I went with the other steamboat toward
> Nauvoo, where I arrived by eight o'clock the next morning.
> 
> Oh, the sorrowful scene to be seen in Nauvoo that day\! There has
> never been nor will there ever be anything like it; everyone sad along
> the street, all the shops closed and every business forgotten. Onward
> I quickened my pace until I reached the house of the late Joseph
> Smith. I pushed my way through the sorrowful crowd until I reached the
> room where his body and that of his brother had been placed (for they
> had been brought from Carthage the previous day). There they lay in
> their coffins side by side, majestic men as they suffered side by side
> from prison for years, and they labored together, shoulder to
> shoulder, to build the kingdom of Immanuel; eternal love bound them
> steadfastly to each other and to their God until death; and now, my
> eyes beheld the blood of the two godly martyrs mingling in one pool in
> the middle of the floor, their elderly mother, godly and sorrowful, on
> her knees in the midst of the blood between the two, a hand on each
> one of her sons who lay in gore, her heart nearly broken by the
> excruciating agony and the indescribable grief. At the head of the
> deceased sat the dear wife of each one and around their father stood
> four of Joseph's little children and six of Hyrum's children crying
> out intermittently, "My dear father." "And my dear father, too,"
> another would say, with no reply except the echo from the walls, "Oh,
> my father." And from the hearts of the mothers, "My husband killed,"
> and the grey-haired mother groaning pitifully, "Oh, my sons, my sons."
> 
> Each in his turn, the thousands made their way forward, sad and
> desirous of having the last look at their dear brethren whose solemn
> counsels and heavenly teachings had been music in their ears, lighting
> their paths and bringing joy to their hearts on numerous occasions. On
> the streets around it was almost the stillness of the grave which
> reigned, but all, the noble as well as the humble, with crystal tears
> streaming down their cheeks. Even the sun and the elements had stilled
> as if in surprise, and all nature looked at the unended madness of man
> toward some of the best on the earth in any age or part of it. I shall
> ever remember my feelings at the time. Now I saw the two wisest and
> most virtuous men on the earth without any doubt, whom I had seen just
> awhile before preaching tenderly from between the iron bars of their
> jail the gospel of peace to those who wanted to kill them; the two
> stood like two reeds in the midst of the storm as witnesses of Jesus,
> despite the jealous fury of the press, of the pulpits, and of the mobs
> of the age; and just like the reed they straightened up their heads
> after every breeze and scorned worldly profit and fame; steadfast they
> clung to their objective until they had finished their work; and like
> their elder brother and their Leader before them they did not love
> their lives unto death, nor did they refuse to face knowingly the
> slaughter; rather they leaped onto the bloody altar which they saw
> waiting for them in Carthage" so they could have a better
> resurrection." But what pen can describe that scene and the feelings
> of thousands of mourners? The only comfort that kept them from sinking
> under the oppression and the loss was knowing that a day of swift
> reckoning would come also before long and that he who has the correct
> scales in his hand perceives the whole and will . . . But I restrain
> myself. It is easier for the reader to imagine this scene than it is
> for me to portray it and its results.

> The two were buried secretly by one another's side, for there was a
> reward of several thousand dollars already offered by their enemies
> for their heads\!

**Jane Elizabeth Manning James, Early Member of the Church, 1813–1908**

Jane Manning James, a young black woman who moved into the Smith home
and who was, in my opinion, Joseph’s only African-American wife. She
lived and worked in the Nauvoo Mansion like all of Jo’s other teenage
wives.

**William Daniels, *Nauvoo Neighbor* (May 7 and May 14, 1845 issues).**

Daniels is a relatively unknown character in Nauvoo history but he
clearly writes from a Mormon perspective as well as that of an
eyewitness to the actual gunfight in Carthage. His account was given in
a affidavit and then embellished by a Mormon writer in May of 1845. He
claims a few fantastic details, but there are other details he provides
which are contextual and helpful to understand the general events of the

How does one describe grief? We see a consistency among these accounts
that the sorrow and mourning the Mormons experienced was ineffable.
Joseph Smith was their supreme leader and when thousands of people are
left directionless by the death of their visionary master the grief is
compounded beyond anything we can understand. Further complicating
matters, there was no plan of succession and the people knew it. These
deaths meant more to the thousands of people of Nauvoo that day of June
29th than anybody else across the world. It immediately cast them into a
world of uncertainty and instability, making them exceptionally
vulnerable to a tyrant at heart to come along and step into the power
vacuum. But, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

There was still a bounty on the head of Joseph Smith. After the public
viewing, the doors to the Nauvoo Mansion were closed and the bodies were
removed from their coffins and replaced by sandbags where they were
buried in a public graveside service. The actual bodies were buried that
night by 9 FreeMasons during a heavy rainstorm in two unmarked plots at
the northwest corner of the unfinished Nauvoo House. They covered the
plot with some brush and rubble; the rainstorm further concealed the
plots and by morning there was no evidence of where Jo and Hyrum were
buried.

Not even the pallbearers knew they were burying sandbags. Here, Emma
exhibits her prowess and understanding of power dynamics. Whoever
controlled the bodies had a strong claim to the throne and she was sure
to keep them well-concealed. A few days later it was feared the
whereabouts of the bodies had been discovered so Emma coordinated their
removal to a new location.

Once again, around midnight, 4 FreeMasons dug up and moved the bodies to
the Nauvoo Homestead, the home the Smiths lived in until the Nauvoo
Mansion was completed in early 1843. Here they were buried under the
cover of night and marked by a beehive which was placed over them. This
location was discovered soon after and Emma, with increasing desperation
to keep control of the bodies, had them moved to a secret location on
the property of Davidson Hibbard in a small grove of trees. Here the
bodies remained for years and it became a favorite place of Jo and
Emma’s youngest son, David Hyrum Smith, to visit as a child. People
knew this as “David’s Chamber,” not thinking anymore of the place than
just where young David liked to go thinking or playing in the woods.

This, however, was also a temporary burial location. After a couple
decades, as Emma was becoming very late in years, she had the bodies
exhumed again and moved to a location in Nauvoo that has been lost. She
was also buried there. It wasn’t until 1928 that grandson of Emma and
Jo, Frederick M. Smith, as prophet of the RLDS church, located the
bodies, exhumed them a final time, and placed them in a sacred permanent
place of honor where the bodies remain today. When they were exhumed in
1928, Fred M. also allowed the remains to be photographed and examined;
those records are in the Community of Christ archives to this day.

Emma recognized that whoever controlled the bodies controlled the
church, so she was a good Mason and kept the bodies secret and under her
control. If she hadn’t retained control of the bodies as well as most of
Jo’s property in Nauvoo, the RLDS church may have never been founded
under her oldest son, Joseph III, in 1860 when he rose to the mantle of
prophet following in the patrilineal steps of his father who was
assassinated 16 years prior. Of course, the progression of all these
events are stories for another time.

An event of the magnitude of a national public figure and POTUS
candidate being assassinated inevitably caught fire across the nation.
From Boston to South Carolina, papers had been covering the newest
intelligence of the Mormon insurrection since the Nauvoo Expositor was
published and disseminated across the nation, with the prophet dead, the
nation’s eyes turned to the Mormon kingdom on the Mississippi.

First to print was the Muscatine Journal out of Bloomington, Iowa on
July 5th, which printed the public declaration from Governor Ford we’ll
read in a minute. The Alton Telegraph and Democratic Review out of
Alton, Illinois published on July 6th the article from the Warsaw Signal
we read last episode. The Holly Springs Gazette from Holly Springs,
Mississippi, published another account in addition to the Warsaw Signal
article on the same day along with The Times-Picayune out of New Orleans
further down the Mississippi river. Then intelligence hit New York and
The Buffalo Commercial, The Evening Post, The New York Tribune, The
Daily Madisonian out of D.C., the Public Ledger out of Philadelphia,
Bangor Daily Whig and Courier out of Bangor, Maine, all published
articles based on the Warsaw Signal article in the days of July 8-10th,
which then carried word across the nation and within 3 weeks word hit
Worcestershire, England in the Berrow’s Worcester Journal of August 1st.

With the bodies buried, the Mormons tossed into chaos and uncertainty,
and the nation’s focus in a heated election year on the battleground
state of Illinois with a Democrat Governor, all that could be done was
assess the situation and move forward. There was also the anti-Mormon
perspective as well as the government’s perspective to consider in all
of this. Let’s have a look at the guy who started the anti-Mormon
political party and was the most vocal critic of the Mormons for all of
Nauvoo history.

**Thomas Sharp/Warsaw Signal**

> "The St. Louis 'Gazette' says that the men that killed the Smiths were
> a pack of cowards. Now our view of the matter is, that instead of
> cowardice they exhibited foolhardy courage, for they must have known
> or thought that they would bring down on themselves the vengeance of

This is representative of the anti-Mormon perspective. They felt
justified in the act, but had trouble justifying it in public discourse.
Vigilante justice is hard to rationalize after the fact, yet Thomas
Sharp tried. Let’s discuss the morals of this entire situation in a
little while. Next, let’s hear from the guy who was resoundingly blamed
by the Mormons for the assassinations, and blamed by the anti-Mormons
for letting Mormon lawlessness get out of hand in the first place,
Governor Thomas Ford. This was his public declaration immediately after
the Carthage gunfight while he was stationed in Quincy, trying to keep
his state from spiraling into civil war just 4 months before the
November election.

Hyrum and Joseph Smith were dead and buried, but that didn’t mean
everything that led to their deaths was suddenly over. The anti-Mormons
and old citizens of Hancock county still wanted the Mormons out of
Illinois. The Mormons wanted to continue flaunting laws in their
self-declared sovereign theocracy. Those interests are mutually opposed
and can’t be reconciled. Governor Ford had been the victim of mutiny by
multiple state militias. In spite of Jo and Hyrum biting the assassin’s
bullets, Governor Ford had largely gained the trust of the Mormons.
Willard Richards assumed a primary leadership role in the church with
the aid of William Clayton while waiting for the Quorum of Apostles to
return from the eastern states. White-out Willard was a prudent pro tem
leader who advocated for peace and helped the Mormon settlement from
spiraling into madness through retaliation. It was late June, the rest
of the leadership wouldn’t get the news of the gunfight until the second
week of July, after which it took them the rest of July and into early
August to make the journey back to Nauvoo. A conference was held in the
first week of August where the people largely chose to follow Bloody
Brigham Young or a newly-discovered charismatic James Strang who carried
a forged letter of succession from the prophet. Hingepin Sidney Rigdon
claimed to be the guardian of the church and commanded the people to
move to Pittsburgh; the people rejected him. Rigdon was washed up and
relied on old systems of public oratory to sway the masses, which failed
in comparison to the appealing stability of a council of men who
deliberated and exhibited a solid front for the church leadership.
Thousands of the converts then living in Nauvoo had been converted as a
result of the Quorum of Apostles’ mission in England and therefore
followed the group of men who converted them and coordinated their
immigration to America.

It was fairly well-understood that the leadership of the church would
remain in the Smith family. Should Jo be removed from the office of
prophet, his older brother Hyrum would inherit the mantle until Jo’s
oldest son, Joseph III, was of leadership age. Hyrum died when Jo died
so that wouldn’t work. The last two remaining Smith brothers after the
Carthage gunfight were Samuel and William. Samuel was a strong
contender, but William was generally regarded as a scoundrel and was
absolutely hated by most of the Mormon leadership. He posed less of a
threat to the Quorum of Apostles than did Samuel. Mother Lucy Mack Smith
argued that “Samuel \[should\] move into Nauvoo and take the Patriarchs
office and says the church ought to support him”. With the support of
Mother Lucy Mack Smith, Samuel would gain the support of the Mormon
population. Samuel argued in a July 10th meeting that he was “Joseph’s
designee as president if Joseph and Hyrum both died.” Willard Richards
pushed back and successfully argued that any discussions of succession
should be postponed until the Apostles returned. A week after this
meeting, Samuel came down with an illness. Hosea Stout, a Bloody Brigham
loyalist like Willard Richards, attended Samuel during the illness.
Stout did this under the direction of White-out Willard Richards; the
Apostles were still abroad and making their way back to Nauvoo. On July
30th, Samuel Smith died and a Joseph loyalist named John M. Bernhisel
wrote a letter to William Smith, the last remaining Smith brother, that
his brother had been poisoned. Samuel’s widow wrote another letter to
William Smith that Hosea Stout “had administered a white powder to him
daily.” Samuel’s brother in law, Arthur Millikin, was receiving a
similar treatment from Hosea Stout with this white powder and was
becoming more and more ill until his wife, Lucy Millikin, Sam’s younger
sister, threw the powder into the fire and Arthur recovered soon after.
Willard Richards tried to remove every Smith threat after Jo’s and
Hyrum’s deaths.

William Smith, who was in Boston as all this happened, returned to
Nauvoo to three dead brothers instead of just two, as well as a
nearly-dead brother in law. While Jo and Hyrum were assassinated by
anti-Mormons, Samuel was assassinated by Willard Richards to pave the
way for his cousin, Bloody Brigham Young, to ascend to president of the
church. White-out Willard must have known that old adage, “when life
gives you lemons, make lemonade, mix in some arsenic, and give it to
your enemies”. William Smith eventually became the target of Bloody
Brigham and was publicly squeezed out of leadership in the church.
William went on to write an expose of Brigham but it fell flat as the
people had already largely decided Brigham was the rightful successor
and plans were in the works to move west. William would also join the
movement of James Strang before publicly apostatizing from Strang’s
church and writing another expose which included Strang’s endowment
ceremony. Crazy Willey Smith, indeed. That was two paragraphs covering
like 7 years of history so obviously there’s much more to it, but those
are stories for another time.

Let’s turn back to the issues at hand because there was still the mess
of the actual gunfight to clean up. Ford was able to keep a lid on his
state for another almost year while also revoking the Nauvoo City
Charter, which disincorporated the city and officially disbanded the
Nauvoo Legion, never to regain official state sanction again. May of
1845 saw the trail of 5 men involved in the assassination. Nine were
officially indicted, but 4 of them, John Allen, William Vorhees, John
Wills, and William Gallaher, fled Illinois before they could be arrested
and brought to court. A witness claimed that Wills, Gallaher, and
Vorhees were first men who pushed through the door to the apartment and
that Gallaher was the man who shot Jo in the back as he mounted the
window sill to jump or fall out the window. Apparently 3 of these 4 men
were the victims of Jo’s blind-firing pepperbox pistol. The 5 who did
stand trial were Colonel Levi Williams, who was the commanding officer
of the men who attacked the jail, Mark Aldrich, who was second in
command to Levi Williams, Jacob C. Davis, who was an outspoken political
opponent of the Mormons and had repeatedly spoken out about their
removal from Illinois, William Grover, a lawyer and militiaman under the
command of Levi Williams, and finally, Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the
Warsaw Signal and the most outspoken opponent of the Mormons for the
past 4 years of Nauvoo history through his newspaper.

Indicting the witnesses was a mess in and of itself. The election of
August 1844 caused a stir between the Mormons and non-Mormons of Hancock
county and Colonel Deming was elected by the Mormons as the new sheriff
of Hancock county with the promise he’d vigorously prosecute those
responsible for the Carthage murders. This is the same Colonel Deming
who fled Carthage as Levi’s men descended on the town because Governor
Ford had instructed him to “flee if menaced by a superior force.”
Immediately after the election, Levi Williams and Thomas Sharp fled
across the Mississippi to Missouri, and only returned after Governor
Ford made modest concessions to secure their safety from Mormon
vigilantes and promised reasonable bail. Governor Ford made these
negotiations with the force of 450 militiamen under his command in
Quincy and the threat of an extradition agreement from Governor Reynolds
of Missouri.

Governor Ford personally oversaw the court proceedings by employing the
lawyers to get the indictments, gain testimonies, and prosecute those
who’d committed the crime. The Mormon lawyers sought to fill the jury
with Mormons and Mormon sympathizers, but they were in a hostile land
with a hostile court. On jury selection day, without state sanction, a
thousand men surrounded the courthouse with their guns and barred
Mormons from entering the building. Only the men who were selected by
this armed anti-Mormon mob were allowed to be on the jury. They “swore
that they had never formed or expressed any opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused,” however, understandably all the men on the
jury planned on acquitting the accused before the jury even heard
opening arguments. The Mormons were allowed a single witness, William
Daniels. Daniels had been at Carthage that day, but because the Mormon
leadership wanted to fill the press with their propaganda, Daniels’
account of the Carthage gunfight had been so corrupted by unbelievable
events that it ended up being a detriment to the prosecution. The Mormon
leadership made the mistake of printing Daniels’ account with complete
falsehoods as a pamphlet in the months before the trial, which forced
Daniels to stick to the story in the pamphlet when he was called as a
witness, completely crippling the prosecution’s case against the 5 men.
From Governor Ford:

> But before the trial came on, they had induced \[Daniels\] to become a
> Mormon; and being much more anxious for the glorification of the
> prophet than to avenge his death, the leading Mormons made him publish
> a pamphlet giving an account of the murder; in which he professed to
> have seen a bright and shining light descend upon the head of Joe
> Smith, to strike some of the conspirators with blindness, and that he
> heard supernatural voices in the air confirming his mission as a
> prophet\! Having published this in a book, he was compelled to swear
> to it in court, which of course destroyed the credit of his evidence.
> This witness was afterwards expelled from the Mormons, but no doubt
> they will cling to his evidence in favor of the divine mission of the
> prophet.

They way he reports it, that Daniels joined the Mormons, gave his
account, then left the Mormons, almost seems like the leadership under
Bloody Brigham bought the guy’s testimony, which wouldn’t be a surprise.
There is more possible evidence for this as Daniels didn’t live in
Nauvoo until like 7 weeks before the trial and his pamphlet was
published, but he was never counted a Mormon after the trial. He was
basically a tool of the Mormons; maybe some listeners can empathize with
that. Regardless, Ford was right, because the folklore of the kid trying
to cut off Jo’s head and being scared off by a flash of light is still a
legend known by most Mormons today; even though that legend was a
complete fabrication that destroyed the prosecution’s case against the
assassins. The church even includes this propaganda today in their essay
about the Carthage martyrdom, even though the story served to be the
greatest weakness to the state’s prosecution of those who committed the
crime. Regardless, a number of witnesses were called in to determine the
facts, but the verdict was already decided before the people stepped
foot in the courthouse.

Some interesting information did emerge during the trial and we won’t go
through the entire thing here. As Governor Ford observed, “Many other
witnesses were examined, who knew the facts, but, under the influence of
the demoralization of faction, denied all knowledge of them.” Every
witness and indicted suspect took the stand and denied they had anything
to do with the assassinations or anything leading up to them, often
times even contradicting their own statements. They testified that they
had no knowledge of the other suspects being there, that there was no
collusion, that they had no idea what was going to happen that day when
they got to Carthage. They all just lied because everybody was under the
control of the far-superior anti-Mormon faction in the area. Governor
Ford observes:

> During the progress of these trials, the judge was compelled to permit
> the court-house to be filled and surrounded by armed bands, who
> attended court to browbeat and overawe the administration of justice.
> The judge himself was in duress, and informed me that he did not
> consider his life secure any part of the time.

It was clearly a charged case. The anti-Mormons successfully got every
Mormon thrown off the jury, intimidated the judge, and filled the
courthouse with cheers and boos depending on what each witness said and
what bearing that information had on incriminating the suspects.

> The consequence was, that the crowd had everything their own way; the
> lawyers for the defense defended their clients by a long and elaborate
> attack on the governor; the armed mob stamped with their feet and
> yelled their approbation at every sarcastic and smart thing that was
> said; and the judge was not only forced to hear it, but to lend it a
> kind of approval.

The jury deliberated for 2 hours and delivered a verdict of not guilty.
All 5 men were acquitted and the outstanding warrants for arrest for the
other 4 men were stricken. How do you charge a mob with murder? You
don’t. At least, not in this case. Notably, a few months later, there
was a separate hearing to determine the criminality of the Mormon
leaders for destroying the Nauvoo Expositor printing press and they were
also acquitted by the same methods. The Mormons filled the jury and
intimidated the witnesses and judge and they were all acquitted. Justice
wasn’t served on the Mormons or the anti-Mormons because this was mob
law and an era of American jurisprudence which didn’t have enough weight
prosecuting systemic crimes like this. It wasn’t until the casino-owning
mafias in Vegas were prosecuted in the 1950 and 60s that we formulated
the conspiracy charges necessary to eradicate hierarchical crime as seen
in Nauvoo and the anti-Mormons fighting Nauvoo criminality.

Let’s go through some of the court record, which was taken in Pittman
shorthand by George D. Watt, an incredible resource for Bloody Brigham
Young in Utah. If only Jo had recognized how useful George D. Watt was
before he died, we might have a lot more of Jo’s actual words to work
with today. I digress.

The defense responded with their opening statement:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>Colonel Richardson</strong></p>
<p>You have heard the inditement read in which is contained the charge, alleged against these defendants, the case is one of vast importance inasmuch as it jeopardizes the lives of these five individuals, you are set to judge this case and upon your decision hang there destiny</p>
<p>The prosecutor for the people has endeavoured to work upon your feelings and as much as possible prejudice you against these men, but between the prosecutor for the people and these defendants we have to say that a verdict has not yet either for or against them, and that it can only be done after the case is tried, and the evidence heard on both sides, but Mr. Lamburn would have you beleive that they are guilty of the charge contained in the inditement before they are tried, the people have that to prove yet, upon evidence, but they will fail, and fail most signally, to produce before you, such evidence, as to render a verdict of guilty, but if we may judge of the guilt or innocence of these defendants, by clamorous reports, or by their conduct and deportment in general we have the most decided evidence of their innocence, we have seen no manifestations on their part to evade a trial and escape from Justice but as soon as the inditement was found against them they presented themselves to the bar of the Court for trial, that they might be acquitted from the charge according to law, they have also insisted upon having a trial, the last term of the Court, and they are now come again voluntarily to be tried, and patiently wait the decision of the Law,</p>
<p>All this time, this charge has hung over their heads, their names have gone to the world carrying with them the alledged infamy, and crime, they have expected, as they still expect to gear all this clamorous noise, go forth but the complaintives, will be most signally refuted, and the public opinion corrected, by the testimony, that shall be addressed and by the Law,... When the testimony is heard, we expect them to discuss the testimony and the law, and it will be for you to render your verdict according to that testimony and that Law.</p>

What followed these opening statements was a farce. Each witness
testified that each defendant wasn’t there or they didn’t see any of the
defendants in the chaos of the day. All of these men lied to protect
each other and ensure mob law and vigilante justice carried the day.

Jonas Hobart:

> Did you see anybody there besides yourself
> 
> I saw a great crowd of people there.
> 
> Did you see any that you knew.
> 
> I did not.
> 
> Did you see any of these defendants there.
> 
> No.
> 
> How many people were there.
> 
> I suppose about one hundred and fifty.
> 
> Did you see any in disguise there.
> 
> I did not.
> 
> Are you acquainted with any of these men on trial.
> 
> I am.
> 
> Did you see any of them at the Jail.
> 
> I did not.

John Paton:

> Was Sharp there, when you was discharged.
> 
> I don’t think he was.
> 
> How far from Warsaw when you was discharged.
> 
> We was five or six miles.
> 
> Was David, Oldridge, and Williams, there, when the company was
> discharged.
> 
> I think they were.
> 
> Was Grover there.
> 
> He was somewhere there a \[illegible\]
> 
> Sharp also.
> 
> I did not see him there.
> 
> What time of the day was you discharged.
> 
> Near twelve O clock.
> 
> Did you hear any of these men address the people upon anything.
> 
> I did.
> 
> Who addressed the people.
> 
> I think Sharp made a small speech.
> 
> Do you watch any of the speech.
> 
> I recollect some portion of it.
> 
> Did he say anything about Joseph Smith.
> 
> (the witness waited some considerable time before he answered)
> 
> I think he said that Joe Smith, was now in custody, and the Mormons
> would elect the officers of the County, and by that means, Joe would
> select his own, Jury and get free.
> 
> Was anything said, about killing, Joseph Smith.
> 
> No.
> 
> Did he was what should be done with him.
> 
> No.

Another interesting detail emerges from a few of the testimonies and it
points to possible complicity by Governor Ford:

John Paton:

> What was the words Sharp used.
> 
> He said the Mormons, had the power to elect the officers, of the
> County, and that Joe, would select his own Jurors, and be set free.
> 
> Did he say anything more.
> 
> Yes, but I don’t recollect all his speech.
> 
> He said Joe, would select the Officers of the County, did he.
> 
> He did.
> 
> Did he say any thing more that you remember.
> 
> He said, the Governor had said whatever they did, to do it quickly

Whatever you do, do it quickly. Spoken under oath from the stand by
somebody who testimony contained plenty of problems like most of the
other witnesses, but it is still notable. Whether or not Governor Ford
said such a thing, or anything alluding to vigilante justice, is
troubling and possible, but can’t be concluded simply from this
statement. Never forget, there are no heroes in this story.

Another testimony from a Mr. Backman

> How long was it before the firing that you saw Mr. Williams.
> 
> I saw Williams going in the line of march up to the Jail.
> 
> Did you see Williams after they returned from the Jail.
> 
> No. I was called on as a Juryman, immediately after,
> 
> Did you see Williams immediately after with Wilson speaking about the
> killing.
> 
> No Sir.
> 
> Did you see Sharp there that evening after the killing.
> 
> No.
> 
> Did you see Grover there that evening after the killing.
> 
> No,
> 
> Did you see Davis here that evening.
> 
> No,

You get the idea. Each of these guys lied and lied to protect each
other. No honor among assassins and the rule of law had long been
dispensed with before this trial was even called.

One exchange from the hearing I want to highlight comes from the
testimony of Frank Worrel. He was the teenage guard at the jail who
colluded with Levi Williams to fire blank rounds at the attacking
militia to give Frank and his fellow guards plausible deniability. This
is a bit of a long read but it’s important to hear how it all transpired
to understand the consequences that followed the trial.

> <u>Mr. Worrel Sworn:</u>
> 
> Did you see Smith where he was killed.
> 
> I did.
> 
> Did you see any of these five men there.
> 
> I did not.
> 
> How many men were there at the time Smith was killed.
> 
> I could not say, but I suppose from one to two hundred.
> 
> How long did they stay.
> 
> I suppose three or four minutes.
> 
> What did they do, when they first, came.
>

> 
> I could not say.
> 
> Was smith shot in a number of places.
> 
> I can not say I never examined the body.

> Did you see any body there, you knew, after the deed was done.
> 
> I did not.

Franklin Worrel, the 19-year-old with a stutter, denied that any of the
defendants were in the mob, couldn’t remember a single face in the
crowd, saw Jo die but didn’t see him hanging out the window, and then
claimed he knows 1/3rd of the people in the county but not a single
person in the mob struck him as familiar. But that final bit is really
important, he refused to answer the direct question of whether or not he
loaded his guns with blank cartridges to make a show of defending the
jail against Levi Williams’s men. The attorney for the defense objected
to him even being asked the question, and after the court decided the
prosecution could ask him, he still refused to implicate himself by
answering the blank cartridge question. This was the largest scandal of
the entire hearing and Frank Worrel was held accountable; not by the
law, but by the Destroying Angel of Mormonism, Orrin Pistol Packin’
Porter Rockwell. Porter Rockwell had the name of Frank Worrel etched
into his mind when he met George D. Grant who gave Port the news of Jo’s
death, telling Port that Frank was responsible. He never let that name
escape his mind.

> This jolly, good-natured Worrell was himself murdered by Mormon
> assassins not long after. He was riding with a friend. A shot was
> heard from a thicket. "That was a rifle\!" said the friend. "Yes, and
> I 've got it," said Worrell, coolly. He fell from his horse and died.
> I have seen, as a child, his grave at Warsaw. A rude wooden
> head-board, bearing this legend, "He who is without enemies is
> unworthy of friends," — not very orthodox, but perhaps as true as most
> epitaphs.

By the end of 1845 when Port murdered Frank Worrel out of retribution,
the Nauvoo Charter was revoked, the Mormon settlement of Yelrom was
burned to the ground, the mob would march into Nauvoo and remove the few
remaining Mormons in September of 1846, only mob law ruled in the area.
The Legion may have been officially disbanded, but that didn’t stop
Bloody Brigham from mustering the men when occasion required, armed with
some repeated rifles from Jonathan Browning, yes that Browning, the same
Browning that made my shotgun, Jonathan Browning started gunsmithing in
Nauvoo and some of the earliest rifles he made are bear a plaque reading
“Holiness to the Lord” which is also on every temple. I want one of
those Nauvoo Legion Browning guns more than I want a turbo kit for my
Miatia, which is to say more than my next meal or a heartfelt letter
from my parents telling me they realize they’re wrong about everything.
I can dare to dream. I’m doing fine\! Stop asking\!

That aside, Governor Ford recognized the increased lawlessness with both
the Mormons and anti-Mormons after both these trials. It was only going
to spiral further out of control.

> No one would be convicted of any crime in Hancock \[county\]; and this
> put an end to the administration of the criminal law in that
> distracted county. Government was at an end there, and the whole
> community were delivered up to the dominion of a frightful anarchy...
> the people were neither capable of governing themselves nor of being
> governed by others. And truly there can be no government in a free
> country where the people do not voluntarily obey the laws.

Now to some broader observations from Governor Ford on the Mormon
movement. It’s a long read from a guy that’s been dead over a century
and a half but his understanding of the situation is very Twain-esque
and absolutely timeless; as well as oddly prophetic.

**Governor Ford p. 357**

> The world now indulged in various conjectures as to the further
> progress of the Mormon religion. By some persons it was believed that
> it would perish and die away with its founder. But upon the principle
> that “the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church,” there was now
> really more cause than ever to predict its success. The murder of the
> Smiths, instead of putting an end to the delusion of the Mormons and
> dispersing them, as many bleieved it would, only bound them together
> closer than ever, gave them new confidence in their fatih and an
> increased fanaticism. The Mormon church had been organized with a
> first presidency, composed of Joe and Hiram Smith and Sidney Rigdon,
> and twelve apostles of the prophet, representing the apostles of Jesus
> Christ. The twelve apostles were now absent, and until they could be
> called together the minds of the “saints” were unsettled, as to the
> future government of the church. Revelations were published that the
> prophet, in imitation of the Saviour, was to rise again from the dead.
> Many were looking in gaping wonderment for the fulfilment of this
> revelation, and some reported that they had already seen him, attended
> by a celestial army coursing the air on a great white horse. Rigdon,
> as the only remaining member of the first presidency, claimed the
> government of the church, as being successor to the prophet. When the
> twelve apostles returned from foreign parts, a fierce struggle for
> power ensued between them and Rigdon. Rigdon fortified his pretensions

> have several new revelations from heaven, amongst which was one of a
> very impolitic nature. This was to the effect, that all the wealthy
> Mormons were to break up their residence at Nauvoo, and follow him to
> Pittsburg. This revelation put both the rich and the poor against him.
> The rich, because they did not want to leave their property; and the
> poor, because they would not be deserted by the wealthy. This was
> fatal to the ambition of Rigdon; and the Mormons tired\[,\] of the
> despotism of a one-man government, were now willing to decide in favor
> of the apostles. Rigdon was expelled from the church as being a false
> prophet, and left the field with a few followers, to establish a
> little delusion of his own, near Pittsburg; leaving the government of
> the main church in the hands of the apostles, with Brigham young, a
> cunning but vulgar man, at their head, occupying the place of Peter in

> Missionaries were despatched to all parts to preach in the name of the

> and spiritual advantages for less labor, and with less personal

> than any other perhaps in the whole world. Their missionaries abroad,

> had made a favorable impression, they began in far-off allusions to
> open up their mysteries, and to reveal to their disciples that a
> perfect “fulness of the gospel” must be expected. This “fulness of the

> essential to complete happiness and salvation. He was then told that
> God required him to remove to the place of gathering, where alone this

> fortified in the new faith by being withdrawn from all other
> influence; and by seeing and hearing nothing but Mormons and
> Mormonism; and by association with those only who never doubted any of

> 
> The Christian world, which has hitherto regarded Mormonism with silent

> organized, the Mormonis in all the world numbered about two hundred
> thousand souls (one half million according to their statistics); a

> Kirtland, Far West, Adamon Diahmon, Ramus, Nauvoo, and the Carthage
> Jail, may become holy and venerable names, places of classic interest,
> in another age; like Jerusalem, the Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount of
> Olives, and Mount Calvary to the Christian, and Mecca and Medina to
> the Turk. And in the event, the author of this history feels degraded

> hitched on to the memory of a miserable imposter. There may be those
> whose ambition would lead them to desire an immortal name in history,
> even in those humbling terms. I am not one of that number…
> 
> From my own personal knowledge of this people, I can say with truth,
> that I have never known much of any of their leaders who was not

Timeless observations. Bravo, sir Thomas Ford.

**Thanks:**

Alright, listeners. I appreciate all of you sticking around for this
really long episode. I’ve prepared a conclusion, not just of this
10-part Road to Carthage series, but also some of my takeaways from the
historical timeline. But first, some acknowledgements and announcements.

First, some announcements. As most of you know, I’m going away for a
while. I’ll still be on Glass Box Podcast every 2 weeks because it feels
like a mistake to have a platform in 2020 and not discuss current
events, but this show is going on hiatus. Here’s what that means for the
wonderful people who support the show on patreon.com/nakedmormonism. I’m
not going to charge you during the hiatus but you can expect periodic
updates on that exclusive feed. It’s 2020 and I know money is a tough
issue for a lot of people right now so I’m not taking your money until
we’re officially off hiatus. So, if you want to join the patreon feed to
get all the extra content, extra episodes, NaMo Home Evenings, early
Mormon audiobooks, extended editions of most episodes, and just tons of
goodies, hiatus is a great time to get all that extra content for free.
Patreon.com/nakedmormonism. Speaking of Glass Box Podcast, if you want
some merch, that’s a great way to support the show. We have mugs,
t-shirts, stickers, all kinds of cool stuff in the shop section of
glassboxpodcast.com.

Next announcement, and this comes in the form of a massive thank you to
listener and friend of the show, Jeff Anderson. Jeff and I have been
working together for the past couple months to get all the show notes
from the entire backlog posted on the website. Simply go to
scripts.nakedmormonismpodcast.com where you can view all the scripts,
listen to each episode, and add any comments or corrections you have.
There’s also a search function. Once again, without the help of Jeff
Anderson, this never would have happened and he’s also a long-time
supporter of the show. Thank you Jeff. That’s
scripts.nakedmormonismpodcast.com; you’ll find a link in the show notes
and a special post of it on the patreon feed.

Next announcement, we’re doing a final live Q\&A this upcoming 200th
anniversary of first-vision day, that’s September 21, 2020 at 6 p.m.
pacific time. If you have comments, thoughts, or questions from the
historical timeline or the Road to Carthage series specifically, post up
a question on the patreon page or tag Naked Mormonism on your social
medias of choice and I’ll answer questions or respond on that YouTube
live broadcast. This will be the final NaMo Home Evening Q\&A to kick
off the hiatus.

Final announcement, I re-recorded the first episode of the show to
reflect the research and writing style I’ve developed since the last
time it was recorded as well as provide a general directory to the
backlog. With this 10-part Road to Carthage Series and episode 1
rereleased, there’s never been a better time to recommend the podcast to
a friend, The more y’all do that, the less marketing stuff I have to do
which is great cuz I’m really bad at it.

With all that said, I don’t know how long the hiatus will be. One more
unashamed plug, patrons at patreon.com/nakedmormonism will get periodic
updates and anybody who signs up during hiatus gets all that extra
content for free.

This podcast would never have become what it is today if not for an army
of amazing folks who helped me every step of the journey. In no
particular order, I owe a massive debt of gratitude to all of the
following people, and yes, it’s a pretty long list cuz I’m a hefty boy
and it takes a lot of shoulders to carry me around.

the longer the list gets so I’ll cap it there. That list is far from
exhaustive and I know there are so many people I missed, so if I didn’t
call out your name just know that I appreciate you as well.

Each of these people have been instrumental somehow in my journey the
past 6 years of doing the podcast. I want to take special note of
Christopher C. Smith. He’s the historian I hired to help put together
this final Road to Carthage series and he’s been an immense help in many
ways beyond these final 10 episodes. Thank you, Chris. I’m also
uploading the 213 pages of Carthage Jail sources Chris compiled for this
series to the scripts.nakedmormonismpodcast.com website.

I also want to thank my wonderful partner, Annie Ross. We met and
started dating while I was mulling around the idea of starting the
podcast and she even listened to the first episodes and gave the
necessary feedback of “this is terrible”. From that point forward I knew
I had a winner and I’m so lucky to now be her lifelong partner. Annie
has been so supportive and instrumental to this journey and she’s taught
me more about life than any other person. Thank you.

And finally, hundreds of hours of broadcast, thousands of pages of
script, nearly 3 million downloads, and you amazing listeners have been

**Conclusion:**

Alright, listeners. Let’s bring this to a wrap with a conclusion. I have
some thoughts about what happened in Carthage as well as some general
thoughts overall so let’s start with the death of Joseph Smith.

How does somebody deal with a person like Joseph Smith? A figure like
Joseph Smith never simply goes away, nor do the systems he created. If
the Mormons faced another exile under his leadership, it would merely
push off the Mormon theocracy problem a few more years and they’d take
all the lessons they’d learned in Missouri and Illinois and make their
next settlement all the more powerful and untouchable. And that’s a
powerful word, untouchable.

Joseph Smith, legally speaking, had constructed his fiefdom such that he
was untouchable by the legal system. How does a legal system rein in
such flagrant abuses? When Jo had escaped that legal system so many
times, what could it do? What could the people acting out of goodwill in
the legal system do to touch somebody who was untouchable?

When I take a look at Jo’s plans, his ability to navigate the legal
system, and everything he intended to do to the world in his Mormon
revolution, all the damage and human cost attendant with revolutions,
the freedoms stolen by a theocracy, the devastation he planned on
wreaking upon an ever-expanding scope of victims of his criminal empire;
when I take all these trends into account, I can only view Joseph Smith
with complete and utter contempt, disgust, and reprehension. Deplorable,
abominable, vile, and absolutely loathsome tyrant of heinous and
revolting proportions.

By the legal standards of the day, Joseph Smith should have been
executed via court martial in 1838 after he’d surrendered at the end of
the Missouri-Mormon War. He acted in open defiance to the government of
Missouri, acted out of pure contempt for federal government authority,
sat atop a criminal empire which committed robbery and murder at a
systemic level, and he used that empire with his own militia to wage war
against the government. He committed treason. If a military officer in
any era of American history ever did what Jo did, they’d be killed on
the spot after an unceremonious court martial. By every legal standard,
whether civilian or military, Joseph Smith rightfully faced the gallows
or firing squad.

The legality of the situation is separate, however, from the moral
judgment. Jo presents a very complicated rendition of a trolly problem.
The problem was solved for us by Levi Williams and his men on June
27<sup>th</sup>, 1844. But the moment before that decision was made for
history, what consequences could we tease out of the situation had he
not died that day?

This forces us to stare down the barrel of alternative history, which
isn’t something historians engage in often because infinite variables
could easily change any possible outcome in unforeseeable ways.

If he didn’t die on June 27<sup>th</sup>, how much more suffering and
death would he have caused? If he was able to carry out his grand
designs to any extent, how many people would have died in his warpath
during the Mormon revolution of America and the rest of the world? How
many people would have been forced into slavery of all kinds because no
empire has ever been constructed without the subsistence of slave labor?
Undoubtedly, Jo’s new empire in the west, once Nauvoo became untenable,
would have been a far more dangerous and criminal theocratic regime. If
the suffering of the Mormons in Missouri and Nauvoo is a pattern we
could carry on to this hypothetical 4<sup>th</sup> Josephite Mormon
settlement, tens of thousands of people would have suffered from abuse
and illness; crime would have run completely out of control,
counterfeiting operations would have been significantly expanded, the
Mormons themselves would be driven to the brink of collapse and wounded
animals are always the most dangerous. Think of how polygamy would have
expanded as well. If the most salacious exposes of how women were
treated in the sex-work ring at Nauvoo, thousands of women would have
been caught up in this oppressed and subjugated state, living off
crumbs, tools for servicing rampant male sexual gratification, abused,
broken, traumatized, ultimately to be discarded for younger generations
of sex workers in an endless cycle of abuse and sex slavery.

Under a Mormon theocratic government, religious compliance would be
required, apostates would disappear, shipped off by train cars to gulags
and camps. The 50/50 population split of men and women would force a
significant percentage of young men to be castrated so as to allow the
religious government officials enough wives. The Lost Boys we see from
fundamentalist Mormon communities today would be an entire social caste.
Property of the Gentiles across the world would be plundered and
absorbed into the church-run bishop’s storehouses as modern Labans and
Nephis would see the aggressor as the hero in these conflicts. Anybody
who dared to call themselves an atheist or stand up to this religious
tyranny in any way would be labeled a Korihor, after which their tongues
would be ripped out, they’d be cast from civilization, and then they’d
meet their untimely end by citizens trampling them to death. Anybody
seeking a change of government from the Mormon theocracy would be
labeled a kingman, and following the example of General Moroni, the Book
of Mormon’s most dangerous fascist, those dissenters would be placed in
prison camps and ultimately burned alive to set an example to anybody
entertaining tendencies of dissent. The Book of Mormon truly is a
horrific book. All that horrific shit is in there and Mormons are
encouraged to apply scripture to their everyday lives.

This draconian system of religious thought-policing would be enforced
via bishops’ interviews at regular intervals. Punishments would be given
for anybody without the most steadfast testimony. Folks in the community
would disappear and nobody would dare question where they went or if
those people would ever be seen again. Were they sent to labor camps
until their testimony was strong enough? Were they sent to fight foreign
wars? Were they outright blood atoned for committing the crime of
apostasy? You better not ask or you’re questioning the ways of god and
could be next. The idea of a Mormon theocracy plagues my nightmares.

What I’m really driving at here is a question I’ve wrestled with for
years now. Was it a good thing for Joseph Smith to die?

I want us all to sit with that question for a long time while
acknowledging our biases. There isn’t an objective conclusion to this
question because there are millions of people across the globe who
consider the death of Joseph Smith to be the worst event in human
history. I, however, have spent years highlighting the absolutely worst
aspects of this man, sparing no page of script to bleed his legacy by a
thousand cuts until all that remains is a hollow shell; a scarecrow held
together by lies. And I want you all to understand that the question of
whether it was a good thing for Joseph to die is something which has
plagued my daily walk and sucked my dreams into oblivion for years now.

I think the question breaks down into two components which are equally
perplexing for me. Did he deserve to die and was it the best outcome for
him to die? One of those questions is retrospective while the other is
prospective.

I’m not letting myself or any of you out of this one easy. We don’t get
to say it’s always wrong for somebody to be murdered and do away with
this question because that’s rarely an option especially when faced with
such a complicated trolly problem that is Joseph Smith. We also don’t
get to say, Joseph Smith was a monster who murdered people, stole
everything people had, caused untold pain, anguish, sickness, and death
of his followers, committed treason while a military leader, he made his
living solely from lying to people every moment of every day of his
professional life, he raped children\! He absolutely deserved to die,
and the question is dealt with because where does that line of thought
begin and end. I see people posting that George Floyd deserved to die
because he was a criminal. These are not equal but the result of capital
punishment for crimes from this line of thinking comes from the same
place. That thought process creates systems of law that gives the death
penalty to atheists and adulterers and commits genocide against people
with a different skin color or god. Remember, it was against German law
to oppose the Third Reich.

Did Jo deserve to die? Legally for the time and legally in most states
and countries today, yes. Many countries have outlawed the death
penalty. Can society really consider itself free while state-sanctioned
murder is the status quo? Whether that murder be through the court
system murdering people who commit heinous crimes with a deranged mind,
or that murder be abrogated to an 18-year-old with a machinegun
murdering people our government has labeled terrorists, can society
progress while governments kill citizens of its own country or other
countries? What are reasonable criteria for governments to murder
people? Once the criteria are established, can we be certain that the
murders our government commits are all 100% justified and reasonable, or
is there a margin of error we tolerate? If 98% of felons are sent to
death row on incontrovertible evidence, are those other 2% of innocent
people we murder negligible? Something which can’t be disentangled from
state-sanctioned murder is the mythology which fuels it. When we kill
somebody on death row, we basically say “you’ve committed such a
horrible crime that any punishment we could foist on you isn’t good
enough. We have to send you to god and he’ll give you the punishment you
deserve.” Can we tolerate this mythological undertone in a secular
nation?

All of this says nothing about vigilante justice and lynchings which is
really at issue in the case of Joseph Smith. What does it say about our
society and government when people take capital punishment into their
own hands without government sanction? This says “you are such a pariah
of our society, we don’t care what the law says, we’re going to kill you
anyway.” This nation has a long and truly abhorrent history of racially
motivated lynchings. They still happen today. But, is there ever a case
where somebody like Joseph Smith demonstrates himself completely
untouchable by law who continues to commit acts deserving the death
penalty, where vigilante justice is warranted? Not only warranted, but
*the only* solution in his case specifically.

Did Jo deserve to die? I’m going to say he didn’t deserve to die.
Whether by vigilante justice or state-sanctioned murder, I don’t think
he deserved death. I think any time we give government license to kill
its own citizens, we quickly find ourselves in dangerous power dynamics.

Let’s deal with the second component of this question, was it the best
outcome for him to die? This is a bit more complex. Mormonism had
reached critical mass long before Carthage and Jo’s movement doesn’t die
with him, so we can put that aspect of the question to the side. Had Jo
been able to carry out his greatest designs, world history would be very
different. He would have caused an indescribable amount of death,
suffering, and harm to billions of people for generations to come. If we
could harness the energy from the suffering he would have caused if he
remained alive and free, we could power the rotation of the galaxy
itself for time and eternity.

If we could somehow quantify the suffering he would have caused if
allowed to live, was it the most moral outcome for him to die on June
27<sup>th</sup>, 1844? Yes. Yes, it was. But not for the reasons you
might think.

Suffering in jail for the rest of his life would cause him incredible
suffering, the law would catch up with him eventually. This isn’t a
judgement on Jo, it’s a judgement about our justice system that’s based
on retributive justice, not rehabilitative justice. He would have
languished for years and suffered and that’s acceptable to a lot of
people, but it would have done nothing to make him a better human being.
It only would have fueled the fire burning inside him and caused his
followers to further cling to the persecution complex. This would only
accelerate his grand designs, especially if he ever escaped from prison
as he’d done before. For the suffering he caused, the wrongs he
committed, and the suffering he would have experienced with a life in
prison, it was best for him to die that day in my opinion.

But, that’s my opinion. What do you think? Should he have been murdered
that day? If your answer is yes, would you have pulled the trigger that
day? Would you have been a spectator? Would you have been a Levi
Williams who put the assassination into motion but didn’t actually fire
a gun?

There isn’t an objective conclusion to these questions because they tap
into difficult aspects of human morality. Justice, retribution, freedom,
the worth of human lives. There aren’t simple answers. It’s never simple
because we’re dealing with the most precious of possessions that
humanity has, humanity itself. When we see injustices by a person like
Joseph Smith, we want simple answers; we yearn for simple answers, then
wonder what it is about the concept of eternal paradise and punishment
from daddy who knows everything we’ve done is so appealing to billions
of people. Why is religion so appealing and effective? Because humanity
is ugly and we’re creatures who want simple answers.

Besides, the worst thing about Joseph Smith isn’t anything he personally
did. It’s not the murder, it’s not the serial rape, it isn’t the
habitual lying for self-serving motives, it’s not the treason or intent
of a theocratic revolution, it’s not all the brazen crime and raising
militias and shadow assassin squads, it’s not all the white supremacy
and visions of racial cleansing for white purity; all of these things
done in the name of the voice in his head, his god, Elohim. Those are
reprehensible, but they aren’t the worst things he did. The worst thing
Joseph Smith did wasn’t anything specific, but rather, what he started.
Truly, the worst thing about this human is his successors.

No treatment of Joseph Smith’s beliefs, sense of morality, or daily
conduct can be complete without examining the system he created and the
people who followed his footsteps. Joseph Smith was a horrible person,
but Brigham Young was simply on a different level. Everything Jo dreamed
of doing, Brigham actually executed. Jo’s most malevolent plans for
America were carried out by Brigham Young in the nation of Deseret. Jo’s
racial supremacy doctrines were carried out by Brigham Young who
committed genocide and created the largest isolated eugenics experiment
in American history.

You know that Mormon theocratic dystopia of alternate history I was
talking about earlier? You may think that would never happen, but
everything I described happened to some extent in Utah under the
tyrannical reign of Bloody Brigham fucking Young, which presents a
larger point: intellectual contagion.

Look, Joseph Smith didn’t make Mormonism in the larger sense. The
culture he grew up in made him and he took bits and pieces of that
culture, beliefs, ideals, concepts, the philosophies of men, if you
will, and simply plagiarized and reskinned them to be his own flavor.
Nothing he did was original, his path through life is perfectly
consistent with countless demagogues before and after him. The culture
made the man who made the religion that was then weaponized by somebody
much smarter than him. For any successful religion to grow beyond a few
families, you need an ideas guy followed by a business guy… yes guy. I
mean that. It’s an indictment, not an endorsement. Intellectual
contagion, the force of populism, outlives the person who spawns their
specific flavor of it.

We see these same patterns around us every day. We can’t stop them but
we can’t afford to not fight them. Ideas are more resilient than the
fragile human skulls which carry them. It doesn’t matter what populist
movement you examine, it doesn’t arise from a vacuum.

Jo wasn’t the most successful imposter the world has ever seen, he yet
another among a swampland of monsters. He was ignorant of almost
everything around him. He was coarse and brazen, corrupt, beholden to
all manner of vice, his lust for power, wealth, and control dragged him
to his grave kicking and screaming. Everything was instant gratification
and convenience; he never considered the consequences of his actions if
they happened more than 5 minutes from the present. He could never
choose the good in the future when there was an evil close at hand. He
was no better or worse than a common trickster, he just had more people
who paid attention to him. He wasn’t a sage old man with a strong drink
at the end of the bar, he was a child in a man’s body who drank like a
miner and was arrogant to destruction. He hated authority and fought it
every step of his path to supplant any systems of power with his own
words of “thus saith the lord”. He was a chameleon who bounced from
piety to levity, purity to lust, magnanimity to wrath dependent on who
was there to perceive his conduct. He was physically strong, mentally
cunning, and morally perverse, a dangerous combination.

But truly what makes him the most corrupt is what those who followed him
accomplished. The people who followed Joseph Smith were leaders and the
led. Any system of belief will present an irresistible pile of excrement
to amoral flies wandering the wilderness. The ranks of Mormon leadership
were filled with unprincipled, defiled, and morally bankrupt monsters,
the exact people with which Jo got along so well. These vicious leaders
co opt the credulity of the wandering followers who know very little of
human nature and who give every possession, minute, and desire to the
leaders. These are the victims of a monstrous self-feeding system of the
ignominious leading the honest and simple. Religion remains the most
powerful human tool for the strong to control the weak. A cloak of
safety given to the sheep by the wolves with comforting words and
promises of eternal riches. Hollow assurances to satisfy the hungry with
the smell of food, cure the dying with spit and mud, uplift the
depressed with derision for daring to not be filled with joy. A person
sacrifices their autonomy and sentience to this force and they become a
sacrificial pawn to the game lord, gluttonous for power, wealth, and
control. Don’t read that, it makes god angry. Don’t like that person, it
makes god angry. Don’t listen to them, they make god angry. But the real
power lies on the flipside of that coin. Do this, steal that, kill them,
you wouldn’t want to make god angry, would you?

The greatest aspiration of Mormonism is no secret; it will not die until
it rules the world. From Joseph Smith to the current nonagenarian
running the company with a skull full of slushie mix, each prophet has
worked tirelessly to make this cult the most powerful cult in the world.
Hundreds of billions of dollars, millions of acres of land, politicians
calling and asking what they can do for the church, meeting with
presidents and foreign dignitaries under the guise of spreading the
gospel, a sales force, tens of thousands strong, giving their own
hard-earned money to have the privilege of selling the church for 2
years. At its heart, this is what kingdom-building looks like in our
modern world.

Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.

Zion the New Jerusalem will be built on the American continent

The field is white all ready to harvest

Consecrate the property of the gentiles

They will vex the gentiles with a sore vexation

Mormons are so nice. They’re programmed to be everything they are. Make
no mistake, all it takes is one modern Bloody Brigham Young for
Mormonism to quickly become the greatest domestic threat in American
history. It’s too wealthy, too powerful, too dangerous to ignore. Joseph
Smith created a doomsday cult with murderous oaths of fealty and
secrecy. We have yet to see this religion live up to its full potential;
and that’s a force of nature worth fighting.

Thank you listeners. For the sake of nostalgia, one last time, let’s
drift away from safe harbor together. I’ll see you on the battlefield.
