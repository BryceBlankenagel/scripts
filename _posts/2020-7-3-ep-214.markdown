Ep 214 – Mormonism From Its Infancy

On this episode, Jo and Hyrum are in Carthage Jail. We spend this week
talking about the grand plans of Joseph Smith’s Mormon theocracy to roll
forth throughout the world. We discuss what this Mormon revolution would
look like, the contrived theological boundaries which justified it, and
the deliberate steps taken to carry it out. From the Book of Mormon to
the Council of Fifty, Jo sought to capitalize off the plight of slaves
and the oppression of Native Americans. Jo’s POTUS campaign comes into
focus within the larger scheme of Mormon expansionist ideals.
Eventually, he realized a powerful ally was needed and attempted to gain
the favor of the Russian Emperor. NO COLLUSION\!

While Joseph and Hyrum Smith languish away in Carthage jail with a few
of their closest and most-trusted allies, we’ve spent the last few
episodes catching other people up to June of 1844. It’s a complicated
time in Mormon and Illinois history with a lot of moving parts.

Today I want to zoom out… take a few steps back and see a larger
picture. Today we’re going to talk about the world of the 1840s and the
Mormon plans of revolution. Let’s discuss the wiring, weaponry, armor,
structure, and fuel source for Talos, the Mormon war machine; let’s find
out this thing’s first mission.

Radical and revolutionary movements throughout history teach us that a
radicalized vocal minority can force a silent majority into committing
any sort of atrocity. Before the silent majority realizes what’s
happened and the way things are, the radical minority has seized too
much power to be stopped. Sometimes these radical revolutions are
necessary to progress society and we have to weight the cost of human
life in the balance. From an American-centric perspective, the
revolutionary war was started by a vocal minority which led to chaos,
death, destruction, but gained America its independence from the British
Commonwealth. The impacts of this revolution, led by a radical minority,
are far-reaching and history-shaping on a global scale. Was the cost of
human life worth it? What was the moral decision to cause the least harm
to the fewest people? Similarly, abolition of slavery was a largely
minority movement in America but when it gained enough weight and
politicians on its side, a civil war became inevitable. Devastation,
mass death and illness, opioid addiction, economic devastation, cities
burned to the ground, overall societal collapse were caused by the civil
war but slavery was outlawed which was a necessary progression for
America to make and was clearly the moral high ground, even if the human
cost was immense. Like it or not, World Wars one and two brought about
some of the greatest scientific advancements humans ever made in
aviation, navigation, communication, machinery, medicine, and,
unfortunately, humans’ abilities to kill one another, more so than any
other singular catalysts in human history. Much of our medicine and
technology we use every day traces its DNA back to advancements made by
governments during wartime. Millions die and the world becomes better
for billions. I don’t like this. I don’t like that humans need
calamities, atrocities, and mass devastation to advance faster than we
do during peacetime. It’s paradoxical and uncomfortable, but it’s also
necessary to acknowledge the vast and irreversible changes and impacts
caused by each of these revolutions.

I’d also be grievously mistaken if I didn’t acknowledge that some of the
most vicious and autocratic periods of history have been the result of
tyrannical overthrow, resulting in far-reaching suppression of human
rights and Orwellian dictatorships. These revolutions retard societal
progression, forcing people under such regimes to live inside a time
capsule of totalitarianism while the rest of the world continues to
progress. We see these examples at the massive global scale when
comparing Europe to China and at the smaller scale when comparing South
to North Korea.

Revolutions come in all shapes and sizes. The most troubling aspect of
any revolution is that it’s nigh impossible to determine whether or not
the outcomes would be better or worse for more people whilst caught in
the middle of them. Often, only with hindsight can we determine whether
or not a revolution was more good or more bad for more people; and even
judgments of what’s “good” and “bad” can be very subjective, especially
when the revolution is happening.

These are simply my musings based on personal observations. Take them
how you will. Why am I opening the episode this way? I posted something
on twitter and one of the radical Mormons who hate-follows me replied
with \#America \#Deznat to which I responded America and Deseret Nation
are mutually exclusive propositions, idiot. There are believing Mormons
today paying their tithing to the wealthiest religion in the world who
pine for the day when a Mormon theocracy is finally resurrected from the
ashes of the Utah Territory and constructed to rule the world, the last
government earth will ever need. Building a Mormon theocracy was a
concept which predated the Mormons creating it in modern-day Utah,
Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, and Wyoming. This idea started with
the man who created the religion and it was the goal of Mormonism from
the earliest days to become the de facto national religion of America,
and use the economic and geographic advantages of America to expand that
religious empire to the other 6 continents.

The Mormon religious revolution was deep in planning phases by the time
Jo was locked in Carthage Jail. Election to POTUS was the next step on
the path to building this theocracy and establishing the kingdom of god
for the last days was in the minds of every sycophant who considered Jo
the mouthpiece of god. They’d declared Nauvoo a sovereign territory,
formed their own government, written their own constitution, and had
their own army. Historians today often regard Jo’s presidential campaign
as a protest candidacy for their treatment in Missouri, but doing so
neglects the real ambitions of Jo and his cabal of criminal elites. They
used the Missouri experience as the persecution narrative to garner
support from the outside world and fire up the members to do whatever
necessary to support the leaders. Persecution motivated the people to
follow the prophet and not go astray, while keeping them distracted from
ever considering the mission of the church and its leaders with any
sense of criticism.

Back on episode 3 of the Council of Fifty series of the show, I wrote a
fictional history from a future Mormon theocratic dystopia as a thought
exercise, but today I want to really examine what Jo and the leadership
had in mind for America given the context of events at the time. Today
is a podcast about the politics and current events in the 1840s, the
view of the Mormon leadership with respect to these issues, and
speculation about the larger plans for the pipe-dream Mormon empire that
was in its infant stages under Jo’s leadership.

From its very foundation, Mormonism sought to be the unifying religion
of the Native Americans. Indigenous people across America presented some
controversial and polarizing issues for European settlers of their
United States since the pilgrims first landed and began extensive
settlement operations. Relationships between Natives and European
settlers varied by location, interaction, and decade. Sometimes the
Europeans sought peaceful negotiations and mutual trade with the
Natives. These types of interactions represented only a small minority
of relations between the groups. As the Europeans settlers grew in
numbers and geographic size, they had more leverage and power by which
they could enforce their will on the various Native groups with which
they came in contact. Interactions which started as peaceful
negotiations and trade agreements quickly devolved into warfare,
deliberately infecting tribes with old world diseases, and outright
seizing of land and genocide. All of this occurring within the context
of the Native American slave trade which was an ever-present reality
predating any European settlements on the continents which also
vacillated in frequency and popularity until the late 19<sup>th</sup>
century. Understandably, after a moratorium was placed on new African
slaves being brought to, and sold in, America in 1807, the Native slave
trade increased, although numbers and details are exceptionally
difficult to nail down. Most of these Native slaves were taken through
kidnapping and raids, while others were prisoners of war from various
tribal conflicts and sold to the European settlers or traded for African
slaves.

Slavery was, and is, a disturbing practice. It runs against human’s
innate morality of property and ownership vs autonomy and independence.
To be able to own slaves, beat them, sexually abuse them, profit off
their labor, force them to live in squalor, while the owner lived in
relative comfort and opulence, it requires suppression of human
sympathies. It requires a system of beliefs which can override the
discomfort of that dissonance. Lucky for these slave holders, they were
Christians who had a bible to assuage all those discomforts and make
their god say whatever he needed to in order to justify atrocities. The
Bible is full of plenty of directions for how to beat slaves so as not
to be held liable for murder, how to acquire female prisoners of war as
sex slaves, how to commit genocide, lots of real great gems in there.

From Genesis 8:25-7

> And he said cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto
> his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord god of Shem; and Canaan
> shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in
> the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

From Ephesians 6:5-9

> “Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the
> flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
> Christ: Not with eye service, as men-pleasers: but as the servants of
> Christ, doing the will of God from the heart: With good will doing
> service, as to the Lord, and not to men. Knowing that whatsoever good
> thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he
> be bond or free. And, ye masters, do the same things unto
> them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in
> heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.”

There are plenty more but those passages immediately come to mind for
reasons we’ll discuss momentarily. African slavery was justified by this
curse. Other ideas predominated about the Native Americans and
understanding their history within the Christian context.

I want to suspend reality for a thought exercise to illustrate this
point. Suppose in a couple hundred years, humans become an
interplanetary species and humans themselves travel to an earth-like
planet in a nearby solar system. Upon arrival we find, not only sentient
creatures, but civilization. This civilization is pre-space age, mostly
agrarian and advanced enough to have livestock animals and cultivated
plant materials, but far from any technology we have back on earth like
harnessing and utilizing electricity or even metalwork. We call them
Soltiplex. By human standards the Soltiplex are primitive, but only a
thousand or so years regressed from the humans who landed there.
Absolutely no communication can take place between the different
domains, but not for lack of trying.

Suppose one of the astronaut humans is an idiot Christian who believes
in the earth being 6,000 years old and thinks evolution is an
anti-Christian lie. These new organisms have to somehow fit into the
paradigm of their stupid book so they communicate extra hard with the
Soltiplex and surmise the Soltiplex are actually communicating in
Adamic, the language Adam and Eve used to communicate with Yahweh. What
an amazing discovery\! This same moron, we’ll call him Chris, Chris
Christianson; this same moron takes off his helmet because he has an
exemption from facemasks card in his wallet. The other astronauts are
like, “Chris, what’s wrong with you\! You’re endangering the mission,
yourself, and the Soltiplex\!” and Chris yells back “Muh religious
liberties\!” and the other astronauts roll their eyes and sigh because
chief justice Kavanaugh’s disembodied sentient head in a jar ruled 3
weeks before they left earth that religious people can commit genocides
if they say they sincerely believe in genocide. Then Chris holds out his
paper bible, a 2020 NIV edition, a relic of a simpler time, to one of
the Soltiplex and points to a passage from John saying Jesus super duper
loves everybody, including weird alien folk. The Soltiplex doesn’t seem
interested but Chris insists on leaving the Bible on this new world with
the Soltiplex. The astronauts conclude to capture a few Soltiplex to
bring back to earth to study, but on the flight home Chris wonders how
they taste and if they’re good at doing laundry. He’s memorized his
bible and sees the Soltiplex all have what appears to be markings all
over their faces, “this must be their curse\!” he exclaims in excitement
of his discovery. The Bible says they’re to be servants. God must have
put the Soltiplex on that planet for his chosen people to find one day
and exercise dominion over\! The other astronauts have to remain silent
because Chris will report them to the neutral and respectful
consideration of religious beliefs bureau if they ever contradict
anything he says or thinks.

The astronauts return with a few specimens of Soltiplex and the
scientist astronauts tell their superiors about all the discoveries.
Chris, however, goes to his buddies at the Christian-science division of
the Discovery Institute and they spend thousands of man hours mining
passages from the Bible to explain how the descendants of Shem were
taken to a different domain after the flood, and the Soltiplex are
clearly an inferior race god put on that planet for humans to have
dominion over.

Fast forward a half decade and Chris Christiansen is with another group
of astronauts on a journey back to this earth-like planet. This time he
was smart enough to bring a box of old print bibles from the early
21<sup>st</sup> century as gifts to the Soltiplex. However, upon
arrival, the planet is devastated. 5 years ago the planet was covered in
millions of Soltiplex with amazing buildings, sprawling plant life,
beautiful scenery; but now, the buildings are abandoned, the plants are
mostly dead and the few alive are sickly and near death. The only living
Soltiplex are in a perpetual state of despair and survival mode,
attacking the astronauts when they approach, clearly starving and in
desperate need of some form of medical attention. Massive dirt piles on
the outskirts of the cities conceal millions of dead Soltiplex. “What
could have caused this devastation?” Chris wonders to himself. “Why
would god curse these wonderful and simple creatures with such death and
destruction?” The astronauts, including Chris, take a few more sample
and specimens of the dying creatures and return to earth. Chris takes
all this data back to the Christian Science department of the Discovery
Institute to comb through the Bible and find some kind of explanation
for it. Chris and his buddies conclude that the Soltiplex who survived
whatever scourge caused such destruction must have been the ones who
caused it.

Chris, however, is a pretty imaginative Christian, and decides to write
a book about the Soltiplex using Bible passages with the help of a few
of his friends at the Discovery Institute. This book happens to explain
the existence of the Soltiplex, turns out they’re descendants of Shem
who believed in Jesus, but turned away from God’s grace and he cursed
them for it. The book sells like hotcakes because people want answers
for what happened to the Soltiplex. Generations pass and Humans begin
making frequent supply and settlement missions to the ruins of
Soltiplex, some of whom carry Chris’s new Book of Soltiplex with them.
These Christians make effort after effort of teaching the few living
Soltiplex how to read this new Book of Soltiplex, which tells them the
never before known history of their Christian ancestors who settled
their empty planet a mere 3,000 years ago. The Soltiplex begin to speak
English and this missionaries are successful in teaching them reading
and writing, but not too much reading and writing or the Soltiplex might
chose to stop helping the human settlers build their human structures
and cultivate their human crops on the ruins of the Soltiplex
civilizations.

As the humans explore more of this new world, they find carvings,
language, maps, calendars, advanced communication highways, and carbon
date early Soltiplex ruins to hundreds of thousands of years old. These
scientists even learn that the Soltiplex actually communicate
non-verbally through a series of sonar waves at frequencies humans can’t
hear. These scientists eventually decipher the carvings and
communications among the ruins and find the Soltiplex have a deep,
complicated, and beautiful system of mythologies, beliefs, and ways to
understand the world on which they live. Beyond that, these mythologies
and beliefs deciphered vary from civilization to civilization across the
entire planet. These scientists painstakingly construct a patchwork
history of the Soltiplex, but it takes decades to do it. By then, the
only remaining living Soltiplex are fluent in spoken and written English
and believe in the Book of Soltiplex as their history. Chris is the
mouthpiece of their mythology who gave them their history and they’re
happy to have it. Whatever these scientists are trying to teach the
Soltiplex is anathema to what’s contained in the Book of Soltiplex and
decry the scientists as heretics.

But then, tragedy strikes. The scientists decipher a critical artifact
in one of these civilizations which states explicitly that immediately
after Chris took his helmet off during the first visit, all the
Soltiplex began dying immediately for unknown reasons. They trace more
artifacts from just after that time and see there’s no question that
Chris taking off his helmet was the cause of all the devastation which
left the planet nearly extinct, which directly contradicts what’s
included in the Book of Soltiplex. In fact, they don’t even call
themselves Soltiplex, that’s the humans’ word for them. The scientists
take all this information to Chris, in his old age living in a complex
with statues of him in every corridor. They tell him he’s the cause of
the Soltiplex nearly dying out and then he commands his Soltiplex army
to kill the scientists for heresy.

As belabored an analogy as that was, it’s extremely difficult to
construct a metaphor which does justice to what Mormon theology really
is. Chris is a monster. Every person who follows in his path and
believes in the Book of Soltiplex is a complete monster. Whether out of
ignorance or a misdirected need to shift the blame for death and
devastation from himself, Chris constructed a facet of his system of
beliefs to explain what happened within the context of Christian
dominionism and manifest destiny. He was the cause of all the death and
destruction; he was the beneficiary of Soltiplex enslavement to build
his human empire on the new world, but to admit he’d committed
atrocities through ignorance and a superiority complex would force Chris
to admit god’s plan is flawed and injustice exists without ultimate
resolution. But, if his book of scripture explains that the Soltiplex
were victims of god’s wrath because of their own sins, he doesn’t bear
the blame. He even has the bible which tells him its okay to take the
Soltiplex as slaves; if the Bible is flawed then his human tendencies to
think slavery is wrong cause him cognitive dissonance because his own
morality is better than the bible. But, every Christian is capable of
ignoring their innate human morality when a Bible passage contradicts,
so it must be the adversary putting that cognitive dissonance in Chris’s
head because the Bible is the word of god and therefore infallible.

As long of a journey into metaphor that was, it’s about the only way I
can explain the genesis of the Book of Mormon and Jo’s desires to give
that Native Americans a Christian history in hopes they’d call him their
prophet and build statues to the great Joseph Smith. The issue of
African slavery and Native American genocide didn’t seem to bother Jo
all that much, especially if he could capitalize off the torment and
atrocities committed by his European settler contemporaries.

Those passages I pulled from the Bible earlier which justify slavery; I
didn’t have to go find them myself because I simply read them from a
letter to the editor Jo wrote in April of 1836.

Jo’s own words justifying slavery and saying the curse of Cain is the
skin of blackness. Whenever you hear modern Mormons saying the curse
wasn’t a skin of blackness and that’s just taking Book of Mormon
passages out of context, you can show them Jo’s own words in this April
1836 letter which was published in the official church newspaper of the
time, the Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate.

Jo’s perspective on slavery would evolve when in Nauvoo, but only
because it was politically advantageous, not out of any moral
convictions. He also wanted to end slavery by giving a massive
government bailout to the slaveholders without any plan to help the
freed slaves themselves transition into life after slavery. Somebody who
flip-flops on the slavery question, especially in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century just 2 decades before the civil war, isn’t doing so out of a
sense of what’s moral, but a sense of what’s popular. Regardless of
where the mouthpiece of an all-loving all-knowing god came down on
slavery, it was a social issue of the day.

The growth of European-American settlements and negotiating slavery in
each new territory or state was a source of heated disagreement in
politics at the time. When Jo put out that statement in 1836, the final
phases of the Indian Removal Act were beginning implementation. Jackson
wanted the Florida territory really bad, as well as what would become
modern-day George, Alabama, and Mississippi so all those Natives needed
to go. The Trail of Tears was started in 1831 and by the mid 1830s when
Jo made that statement about slavery being totally sanctioned by god,
more than 45,000 Natives had crossed the trail, which opened over 25
million acres for European-American settlement. Political philosopher,
Alexis de Tocqueville, on visit from France in 1831, saw firsthand the
brutality of these forced resettlements.

> In the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction, something
> which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu; one couldn't watch
> without feeling one's heart wrung. The Indians were tranquil, but
> sombre and taciturn. There was one who could speak English and of whom
> I asked why the Chactas were leaving their country. "To be free," he
> answered, could never get any other reason out of him. We ... watch
> the expulsion ... of one of the most celebrated and ancient American
> peoples.

It's not that people like Jo living in the 1830s had a different sense
of morality than all of us; they weren’t amoral robots or something.
It’s because European Americans enjoyed the life afforded to them as a
result of this brutality that they chose to not take a stand or to
simply look the other way when their fellow human beings were being
forced from their lands and marched to their deaths. However, Jo took
this a step further because he sought to profit from this oppression and
persecution. He knew what was transpiring during this Native removal and
his revelations provide a window into his mentality.

His revelation given in December 1832, contained in modern D\&C 87,
says:

> Verily, thus saith the lord concerning the wars that will shortly come
> to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will
> eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls; And the
> time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations beginning
> at this place. For behold, the Southern States shall be divided
> against the Northern States,… and then war shall be poured out upon
> all nations. And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall
> rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined
> for war. And it shall come to pass also that the remnants \[Native
> Americans\] who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and
> shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore
> vexation… And thus,… shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to
> feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty
> God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all
> nations. Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until
> the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the
> Lord. Amen.

Jo was privy to the social issues of the day and he prophesied that the
coming civil war would bring about the end of the world, god would
return, and the saints will be blessed if they stand in holy places and
be not moved. Odd that Jo said the remnant, meaning the Natives, will be
marshaled and disciplined for war, implying they would join the slave
uprising thus making the civil war even more calamitous and deadly.

The plight of Native Americans was widely recognized but rarely opposed
by the wider public to any extent which may stop it from happening.
Indigenous peoples live on reservations across America today because the
political will somehow still isn’t there after more than 400 years of
oppression and abuse. People just like Joseph Smith sought to convert
Native Americans to Christianity as part of assimilation into what they
called “civilized” society. It was a common idea of the time, if the
Natives would assimilate properly by converting to Christianity, owning
homes, building and maintaining stores and trading posts, and even
owning African slaves, then they’d be treated as equals by
European-American settlers. This is clearly white supremacy and it’s
disgusting, but Jo took the concept a step further. Not only did the
Natives have to convert to Christianity, but they needed to convert to
his Christianity by accepting the Book of Mormon as a book about their
history, thus accepting the label of “Lamanite” and embracing the
erasure of their true history.

Jo is our Chris Christiansen. He was responsible, not personally, but by
virtue of the time and place he lived, of the near eradication of Native
Americans and he personally capitalized on their suffering by writing
their history for them without knowing the first thing about them. It
was always his dream to give them this history and be regarded as their
religious leader, a religious leader who could federate the scattered
remnant together and vex the gentiles with a sore vexation. 1830s
America could handle the power dynamic created by slavery and still keep
the slaves oppressed; it could also handle the constant expansion of
America into Native regions by pushing them further and further back.
These were each tenuous fronts to maintain. Like the Nazis waging war on
the western front then turning east and attempting to expand into
Russia, there is a finite amount of this oppression and warfare a nation
can handle. If, however, the slaves and Natives were able to organize
and join forces, they were positioned to make a pincer movement on both
sides of the Southern states and they could burn through it in a matter
of months before taking their war to the Northern states out of
retribution. This was the ever-present threat for European-American
settlers. Any white man, like possibly a religious leader, who could
utilize this pent-up rage from oppression and genocide for his own ends
would become the greatest force America had ever dealt with to that
point. The further white settlers could push back Natives and the longer
they could keep slaves from organizing, the longer the power dynamic
remained exceptionally comfortable for those European settlers who were
building America as we know it from the comfort of their offices on the
whip-scarred backs of slaves atop the corpses of Indigenous people.

These weren’t high minded ideas or pipe dreams Jo thought up in a
drunken stupor, he took deliberate actions to integrate his Mormon
missionaries with the Native Americans, attempted to get them to take
Native women as plural wives as early as 1831, and frequently made
in-roads with Native communities throughout his entire 14-year ministry.
It started with the first missionary troop who visited the natives in
Kaw Township just outside Jackson County, Missouri. The missionaries
were kicked out because they annoyed the Natives and didn’t have the
proper permits, causing tensions between the Mormons there and the
Missourians in Jackson County.

Eventually Jo made war against the state of Missouri and by doing so
committed high treason, murder, and arson. Upon his arrival in Nauvoo,
Jo sought to forge relationships with Natives in multiple directions. He
met with Pottawatamie chiefs in Nauvoo on multiple occasions, gave them
gifts, possibly even gave them a portion of the Egyptian Papyri scrolls
he bought in Kirtland as a token of friendship, and 11 of these chiefs
were present during the last General Conference Jo presided over in
April 1844. He also sent Lyman Wight to Wisconsin territory where Wight
made a number of deals with the Natives there who were sick of how the
government was oppressing them and had faith in Jo’s great mission of
rectifying these wrongs. If the two groups, the Mormons and the
Pottawatamies, could use each other to accomplish mutual goals, good for
everybody, right? You think Jo would show them any loyalty or would he
discard them as soon as they stopped being useful to them?

That will forever remain a mystery as Jo was assassinated before his
grand plans were hatched. Missouri, however, was a turning point for Jo.
From his escape from Liberty Jail to his internment in Carthage Jail he
did everything in his power to insulate himself and his ability to
flaunt the laws. What we’ve examined for the past 3 years on the podcast
has illustrated his ability to craft the Nauvoo government and municipal
court in such a way that he could commit crimes, or cover up crimes,
with impunity. These weren’t his actual grand plans; they were merely
symptoms of what he sought, the expansion of his empire from the east to
the west coast, from Florida to Oregon. From there, greater expansion
would follow with Jo as king of this new Jerusalem.

This was a dream shared by his fellow conspirators in building the
Mormon theocracy, and in many ways is still a belief owned by some
Mormons and church leadership to this day. The constitution will hang by
a thread and it will be enlightened members of this church which will
come to the rescue on their white horse… or Learjet.

We discussed this a bit in the last episode when reading the Council of
Fifty minutes. This new Mormon government was to be the final government
the world would ever need. This was the government of God and the
Council of Fifty was to bring it. They opined in the May 13<sup>th</sup>
meeting reading letters from Orson Hyde about Texas and Oregon.

> We have this day had a long conversation with Judge \[Stephen A.\]
> Douglass. He is ripe for Oregon, and California. He said he would
> resign his seat in Congress, if he could command the force that Mr.
> Smith could, and would be on the march to that couuntry in a month.

Orson Hyde continues reporting what he learned during his visit to
Washington D.C.

> I learn that the eyes of many aspiring politicians in this place are
> upon that country; and that there is so much jealousy between them
> that they will probably pass no bill in relation to it. Now all these
> politicians rely upon the arm of our government to protect them there,
> and if government were to pass an act establishing a territorial
> government west of the rocky mountains, there would be at once, a
> tremendous rush of emigration; but if government pass no act in

> themselves and their own resources to hazard the enterprize.

Sounds like the Senate needed a Bloody Brigham Young to go out there and
blaze the trail. Orson Hyde continues:

> Should Texas be admitted, war with Mexico is looked upon as
> inevitable. The Senate has been in secret session on the ratification
> of the treaty of annexation; but what they did we cannot say… Judge
> Douglass says he would equally as soon go to that country without an
> act of Congress as with; “and that in 5 years a noble state might be
> formed, and then if they would not receive us in the union, we would
> have a government of our own”.

That must have been pretty exciting for both Jo and Bloody Brigham to
hear read out loud from Orson Hyde’s letter. Hyde, however, didn’t stop
there.

> It is the opinion here among politicians, that it will be extremely
> difficult to have any bill pass in relation to the encouragement of
> emigration to Oregon; but much more difficult to get a bill passed
> designating any particular man to go; but all concur in the opinion
> that we are authorized already.

Orson Hyde also sent coveted maps of John Fremont’s exploration trip,
probably stolen from the Library of Congress by Stephen A. Douglass. A
problem presented itself with these letters, though. While there was no
chapter of the American government established out in Oregon or on the
west side of the Rocky Mountains, and the Texas question was still a
huge unknown as it would inevitably result in war with Mexico was
annexed, it didn’t mean those possible settlement places for the Mormons
were uninhabited. That’s where Jo’s petition to Congress for 100,000
volunteers comes into play. Not soldiers, volunteers. Not actual
militiamen, but volunteers and if they happen to convert to the church
during the journey then so be it. They’ll get along much better with
their fellow Mormon Nauvoo Legionnaires better that way.

With these grand plans for the next Mormon settlement underway with
Nauvoo as the launch point, how does Jo’s presidential campaign factor
into the decision, and why Oregon? For this, we must turn to a person
who was a brief confidant of Jo. Jo thought he could use this guy, this
guy just wanted to infiltrate the Mormons and see what was going on and
help affect an arrest. Our good old friend, the quintessential
anti-Mormon expose writer, Joseph H. Jackson. The final pages of
Jackson’s 1844 expose reveal what the real grand plan was and it sheds
a pretty sinister light on the grand scheme, how Talos, the Mormon war
colossus, was to be truly implemented. This passage centers around a guy
named Uriah Brown, an inventor. Uriah Brown had devised a clever device
and offered it to Jo, who promptly inducted him into the Council of
Fifty.

I’ve read this from Joseph H. Jackson’s expose on the show before and I
even read the entire expose for those special listeners in the know who
support the show at patreon.com/nakedmormonism. However, given the
context of today’s show and what lies in our very near horizon, this
passage really bears underscoring today. Beginning on page 33 of A
Narrative of the Adventures and Experience of Joseph H. Jackson in
Nauvoo; Disclosing the Depths of Mormon Villainy:

> I have now given a brief sketch of some of the damnable practices
> carried on, in the name of religion, in Nauvoo; but to avoid an
> interruption, I have omitted to narrate several matters that passed
> before my observation. The world is generally aware of the fact, that
> Joe Smith was a candidate for the Presidency. This has excited
> universal contempt and merriment; for no one conceived that Joe had
> any idea of his own success; but he had his even in this, which was
> more treasonable and deeper laid than a person unacquainted with him
> could imagine. His object was simply this: There was a Mr. Brown,
> formerly of Rushville, with whom I became acquainted in Nauvoo, soon
> after my arrival there. This man has a wonderful genius for invention,
> and has planned a sub-marine battery and steam fire ship, which, to
> all appearance, is capable of great execution. He stated to me, that
> he had been operating for 21 years, in perfecting this work, but had
> not the means to bring the matter before the nation, and that Joe made
> him a propusition, which had caused him to remove to Nauvoo. This
> proposition was, to furnish the means to take him, together with G. A.
> Adams and Orson Hyde, to Russia, where the invention would be laid
> before the Emperor; and as Joe had great faith in its success, he
> expected a large sum for the secret, Which Brown and Joe were to
> divide. This was palmed off on Brown, but was far from being Joe's
> real object. His real object, as he disclosed it to me, was this: He
> would first run for President, and thus be be able to prove to the
> Emperor of Russia his strength in the Union. He would then send G. A.
> Adams, Orson Hyde, and Brown to Russia, and after the utility of the
> invention had been fairly proved to the Emperor, Joe's proposition to
> him was to be submitted: which was to form a league for the overthrow
> of the powers that be. Now this may seem too ridiculous for any man to
> imagine possible; nevertheless, no one acquainted with the excessive
> vanity of Joe Smith, will doubt but that he in reality believed that
> he could form even so preposterous a union. Joe's idea was, that by
> the aid of Brown's invention, he could introduce himself to the
> Emperor, and having the strongest faith in the efficiency of the new
> discovery as an instrument of warfare; he imagined, that if His
> Majesty could once see the wonderful work, that he would be willing
> even to take him as a partner in the benefits, for the sake of its
> advantages. As wild as this scheme may seem, it is no wilder than many
> that have characterized Mormonism from its infancy.

This plan was never carried out, but the Council of Fifty minutes list
the mission to Russia, corroborating Jackson’s single most disturbing
and salacious of claim within his expose. Notably as well, after Jo’s
death, Bloody Brigham sent a letter to this inventor, Uriah Brown, in
1851 asking for the flamethrower to make quicker work of the Natives
they were encountering in the Utah territory.

But what does this passage really mean in the context of Jo’s deepest
desires? You see, dear listener, the outcome of his presidential
campaign actually didn’t matter. It was just a marketing ploy for a much
larger and more dangerous plan; that was, to form an alliance with the
Emperor of Russia, use Uriah Brown’s submarine, and take over the entire
world. Why and how? Russia had proven so resilient to Napoleon’s forces
just 3 decades before, Britain was a sharp enemy of America, having so
recently lost the colonies from the Commonwealth, the next largest
global ally Jo could see on the horizon was Russia. Once this alliance
was formed with the new Mormon settlement in Oregon, hundreds of
thousands of soldiers ranging from volunteer Americans, oppressed Native
Americans seeking restitution of their lands, and freed slaves
bloodthirsty for retribution against their former masters; this ragtag
army with naval superiority via flamespitting submarines to completely
decimate the Royal British fleet, this was a world-ending plan for
Mormon global superiority.

Had even a portion of these plans been carried to completion, we would
be living in a largely different world today. I may just be speaking for
myself here, and if any of the people I hate-follow on social media
truly believe what they say then this is certainly the case, but it was
a good thing for Jo to be stopped dead in his tracks. When the Mormon
Titan, Talos, was left without a pilot, it left many people devastated,
but because these plans were left shattered to pieces, the world became
a better place that day. If you disagree, fight me on social media about
it; you’ll probably gain some new DEZNAT followers.

Alright, folks, let’s talk about what’s ahead. A few weeks ago I gave a
brief forecast of the podcast, well now it’s time for some details. What
lies ahead is a 10-part series titled “Road to Carthage” to conclude the
history of Mormonism under its founder, Joseph Smith.

We’re going to spend the first 7 of those episodes examining various
stories and aspects withing Joseph Smith’s and early Mormonism’s
history. We’ll be discussing many of the most prominent figures but of
course our primary focus will be Jo himself. We’ll cover the timeline
focusing on the four primary theatres of Jo and Mormon history, New
York, Kirtland Ohio, Missouri, and Nauvoo Illinois. Each episode will
highlight stories in each of these locations throughout the entire 39
years life of the founder. Then, episode 8 will be the final hour,
discussing the events of June 27<sup>th</sup> which preceded the
assassinations that evening. Episode 9 will be the Carthage
assassination itself. And finally, episode 10 will be the immediate
aftermath once the bodies were brought back to Nauvoo. That final
episode will also contain a conclusion reflecting on everything I’ve
learned on this journey. I’ve hired personal friend and Mormon history
mercenary, Christopher C. Smith to help put together a final product I
hope you’ll all enjoy as much as I’ve enjoyed making them. Chris has
been a complete lifesaver and you can check the show notes to find him.

These episodes will be standalone. No listener mail. No thanking new
patrons. Nothing but history with self-referencing episode numbers
throughout in case you want to learn more about anything I say from
episodes in the backlog. And, of course, each episode will have
extensive show notes. They’re also all really long. I think every script
right now is over 21 pages; for context, today’s is twelve pages.

Now… As for what comes after the Road to Carthage. The podcast will be
going on hiatus. After nearly 6 years of almost entirely weekly
episodes, your very tired host needs a little break. Longer than a few
weeks, no longer than several months. What comes after the hiatus, well,
you’ll just have to stick around to find out. Hopefully, for those of
you who financially support the show on patreon.com/nakedmormonism, a
few months’ break during the second half of 2020 will probably be a
welcome respite (resput). I’ll probably still put up occasional
patron-exclusive content over there during hiatus, but I won’t be
charging you lovely folks for it. Tanner and Skyler just signed up for
all the patron content, maybe join the NaMo outer darkness family during
the hiatus and you get all the extra content for free until the show
boots back up. Lots of audiobooks, live hangouts, extra interviews,
extended NSFW editions of the show. Meh, whatever… you hear the sales
pitch every episode.

In the meantime, I’ll still be doing shows every two weeks of current
events and Mormon history deep dives over on Glass Box Podcast so if
you’re going to miss me just too much during the Naked Mormonism
hiatus, you can still find me there. Or, hey, buy some merch at
glassboxpodcast.com/store\! That’s super helpful too\!

I’ll also be attending and presenting at Sunstone on the Whova app this
upcoming July 29-Aug 1. My session is on Saturday at 3:15. Information
for virtual attendance is in the show notes. The theme this year is,
fittingly, Gratitude and Grief.

That’s all the housekeeping for now. Thanks for lending me your ear and
I hope y’all are ready to go on one hell of a ride for the next 2.3
months. I hope to talk at ya next time, here, on the NMP.
